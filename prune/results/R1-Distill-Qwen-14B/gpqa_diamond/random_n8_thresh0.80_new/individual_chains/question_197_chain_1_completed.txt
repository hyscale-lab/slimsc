Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data. Then, it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. I remember that carbonyl groups like those in ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids show up around there. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3300, which fits the first peak. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. But wait, let me check the other peaks. There's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be aromatic C=C stretches. So that suggests an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. A proton that's downfield like that is likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10, but sometimes more deshielded. Alternatively, that could be a carboxylic acid proton. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's it. Then, the NMR has a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. So, if the benzene is substituted in the para positions, maybe with two substituents.

Looking at the substituents: the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm could be two substituents on the ring. Let me think. For example, in para-substituted benzene with groups like -COOH and maybe a methyl or an ethyl group. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That's typical of a methyl group attached to a CH2, maybe like an ethyl chain. Also, a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests some kind of branching. Oh, maybe it's part of a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, like an isobutyl or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The 10.5 ppm peak is probably the carboxylic acid proton. So the compound is a benzoic acid substituted in the para position with some group. The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which means they're in a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent on the ring is a group that's not a strong de-shielder, maybe an alkyl group.

Looking at the rest of the NMR. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 1H. That could be a CH group attached to something else. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 2H, maybe a CH2 connected to the CH. Then, 1.4 ppm is a triplet (d, 3H). Wait, a triplet? Or is it a doublet of triplets? No, the question says 'd'—so doublet. Wait, but I thought a triplet would be from a CH2 next to another CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1.4 ppm is a -CH(CH3) group, where the methyl is split into a doublet. Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group?

Wait, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. Let me think: the structure could be something like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group in one para position and an isobutyl group in the other para position. So, the substituents would be -COOH and -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something like that.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which likely is a methyl group at the end of a chain. So maybe it's a butyl group. Let's consider the substituent as a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me try to draw the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- no, wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)-. Because butyl has four carbons. So, sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: the substitution is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not right.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl or isobutyl. Let me think: the substituent is a butyl group where the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring? Wait, no, perhaps the structure is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Maybe not. Let me think: The substituent in question is a sec-butyl group, which would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR more carefully. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That might be a methine (CH) group. So, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, then the CH would show up around 2.9 ppm. Then, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which would be the two CH2 groups. Let's see: the substituent is a pentyl group, but no, the substituent is butyl, perhaps.

Wait, the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl. Wait, perhaps substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-2, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with branching. Let me think: the substituent is a propyl group, with a branch. Wait, the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet. So, that's a methyl group attached to a CH. So, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. But wait, the substituent is a butyl group? Let me think again.

Wait, if the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, that would be an isobutyl group. Let me imagine that. The substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would make it a tertiary carbon, but the NMR doesn't show any triplet for that methyl group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That might be a methyl attached to a CH that's connected elsewhere. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, let's look at the substituent as a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group, but that seems unlikely. Maybe the structure is a benzyl group connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2 and then a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me try to parse the NMR again.

The NMR data:

- 10.5 (bs, 1H): probably the -COOH proton.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): aromatic protons, para substituents.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): a CH group.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): another methyl, probably at the end of a chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a pentyl substituent. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to another CH2. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, considering the 1.4 ppm as a methyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH2, which connects to a CH3. So, the substituent would be a butyl group arranged as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, that would be a sec-butyl group. Because the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituents on the benzene are a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure is benzene with a -COOH and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a methyl group at the end of a chain. So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be benzene-sec-butyl and a -COOH group.

Wait, the substituent would be benzene with -COOH in the para position and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group in the other para position. Let me think about the NMR.

In that case, the substituent's CH2 groups would give signals. The CH(CH3) would have a proton at around 2.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 groups would be around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet. The methyl groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet. And the terminal methyl (from the CH2CH2CH3?) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would require more integration.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? I'm getting confused. Let me think again: butyl groups. The four carbons in a row. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain, not branched. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, another approach: the substituent has a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3). Then, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached via a CH2. That would make the substituent a propyl group with a branch. Let me check.

In that structure, the benzene is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH3. Wait, that can't be because that would make it a tertiary carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the structure is benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group and a -COOH group on the para position.

In that case, the NMR would show the following for the substituent:

The CH2 group attached to the benzene would have protons at around 2.9 ppm (maybe as a multiplet), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the NMR data shows:

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → this is probably a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a branching.

So, the substituent would be a group where a CH has a methyl attached, and perhaps connected to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. That would make the structure a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. No, that seems longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isobutyl group. Let's think about the NMR for that.

The structure would be benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no, that would be a isopropyl group attached via a CH2. So, the substituent is a isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, in that case:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene would have protons that might split into a multiplet around 1.7 ppm (maybe 2H).
- The CH(CH3)2 would have a proton around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.
- The two methyl groups attached to the CH would resonate around 1.4 ppm as a doublet (each 3H, but integrated together? So 6H? But the NMR shows 3H, so perhaps only one methyl is attached.)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction called the Koch–Haaf oxidation. Wait, no. Koch–Haaf is for ketones, turning them into carboxylic acids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Wait, another possibility: if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, and the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a substitution reaction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but that's for alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a decarboxylation or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that converts a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's usually done with PCl5, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution that converts the -COOH into a -CH2I group or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group that, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, undergoes a substitution. For example, if the substituent on the benzene is a halogen, but in this case it's an alkyl group.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce a carbonyl group. Wait, but in this case, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so it's a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, I think it might undergo a substitution reaction. Wait, for example, in the presence of HI, the carboxylic acid can be converted to an acid chloride, but red phosphorus might catalyze something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride. Wait, but red phosphorus is more commonly used in the Hittig reaction for forming alkenes from phosphonate esters. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent on the benzene is a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or ketone, and the reaction converts it into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a cleavage of a benzylic C-H bond. Red phosphorus with HI is used in the Wurtz reaction, but that's for coupling alkyl halides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a benzylic proton. Wait, the substituent on the benzene is an alkyl group, and the reaction replaces a hydrogen on that alkyl group with iodine. So, for example, if the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3 group, the reaction might replace a benzylic hydrogen with iodine, making a -CH2CH2CH2I group. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI (concentrated) are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation, but that's usually with another reagent, like a base, and involves aldehydes. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that's with different reagents.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid is replaced. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a methyl ester, but that would require something like methyl iodide and a base, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The options given are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → structure would be a phenyl group with an ethyl substituent and a propanoic acid group.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → that's cumene, a benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl in para.

Wait, let's think about the reaction: Compound X is treated with red phosphorus and HI. So, what kind of reaction would that be?

Wait, I'm trying to remember. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction for the conversion of alkyl halides to carboxylic acids, but that's when the alkyl halide is alpha to a benzene ring, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carboxylic acid is transformed into an iodide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an acyl iodide. But that would require an acyl iodide, but in our case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the preparation of an acyl iodide. I think that carboxylic acids can be converted to acyl iodides using PCl5 and iodine, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI can be used as an alternative. The reaction would be:

RCOOH + P + HI → RCOI + PHO and H2O.

So, if the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, the product would be the corresponding acyl iodide.

Wait, but the options don't show any iodide groups. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into -CH2I. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, another approach: what's the structure of Compound X?

From the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH proton.
- Aromatic protons in para positions, so the substituent is in para positions. One substituent is -COOH, the other is a branched alkyl group.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps the CH in the substituent.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): adjacent CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): methyl attached to CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl, indicating a chain.

Putting that together, the substituent is probably a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? No, perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be an isobutyl group.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, the structure is benzene with a -COOH and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 substituent in para positions. So, the substituent is a isobutyl group attached via a CH2.

Wait, no: the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is an isoamyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which would be a pentyl group, but again I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached via a CH2, making it a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group.

In that case, the NMR would have the CH2 group (from the benzene) at around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet (2H), then the CH(CH3)2 group at 2.9 ppm (1H), and the methyl groups on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, doublet). The terminal methyl (on the CH2) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, which is an isopropyl group attached via a CH2, making it a iso-propyl group as a substituent.

So, the structure of Compound X is 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but the substituents are in para positions. So, the substituent is an isobutyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2) attached to the benzene in the para position to the -COOH group.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) and Ph-(CH2CH(CH3)2) in para positions.

So, the correct name would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid. But looking at the options:

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Hmm. Wait, what's the difference between isobutyl and sec-butyl? Let me think.

Butyl groups can be named based on the point of attachment. The four carbons in a butyl group are arranged as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. The substituent can be attached to any of the carbons.

- n-butyl: attached to the first carbon → -CH2CH2CH2CH3.
- iso-butyl: attached to the second carbon, but with branching → -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.
Wait, no, iso-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. That is, the substituent is attached to the second carbon, which has two methyl groups attached. So, iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no. The iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the second carbon is attached to two methyl groups.

So, the substituent in the compound is an iso-butyl group. Therefore, the structure is 4-iso-butyl benzoic acid. But looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. What's a sec-butyl group?

Wait, the sec-butyl group is when the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a butyl chain. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense because that would imply a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me make sure.

The four possible butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3.
2. iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 → But wait, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. No, the iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

n-butyl: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (all in a straight chain).

iso-butyl: CH(CH3)2-CH2- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, that can't be because iso-butyl would have the substituent on the first carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think the correct structure for iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3)2.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Which is an iso-butyl group.

So, the structure of Compound X is 4-iso-butyl benzoic acid. Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but what is the difference between iso-butyl and sec-butyl? Let me think.

The term 'sec-butyl' refers to the substituent being attached to the second carbon of a butane chain. So, the structure is -CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the substituent on the second carbon. That would be a butyl group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon, making it a secondary carbon. So, the structure would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that seems longer.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a butyl group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would require five carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look up the correct structure of iso-butyl and sec-butyl groups.

Iso-butyl group: -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is attached to the second carbon, which has two methyl groups.

Sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct structures are:

- Iso-butyl: the substituent is attached to the second carbon, which has two methyl groups. So, the structure is CH(CH3)2CH2-.

No, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed.

If the substituent is an iso-butyl group, then the compound is 4-iso-butylbenzoic acid. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. But that doesn't align with the NMR data I have.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But tert-butyl is a -C(CH3)3 group, which would have a singlet in the NMR for the 9H, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed to the reaction. Suppose Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced with an -OH group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of a benzylic alcohol to form an alkene, but that would require an alcohol, which isn't present in Compound X as far as I can tell.

Wait, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think again.

The NMR data indicates a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene with a branched alkyl group. The IR shows a strong carbonyl peak, which aligns with a carboxylic acid.

So, the reaction is between Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) and red phosphorus with HI. What's the product?

Wait, when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's possible that the -COOH group is converted into a methyl group. Wait, how?

I recall that in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a carboxylic acid can be converted into an alkane by removing the oxygen. For example, RCOOH → RCH2OH, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the production of alkanes via the reduction of carboxylic acids. For example, RCOOH → RCH3. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which under certain conditions can be reduced to an alkane. So, RCOOH → RCOI → RCH2I → RCH3.

Wait, but the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about the steps:

1. RCOOH reacts with excess HI and red phosphorus to form RCOI (acyl iodide).
2. Then, RCOI may undergo further reaction, perhaps with red phosphorus, to form an alkane.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -COOH group with an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when a benzoic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might lose the oxygen and form a methyl group. So, the product would be toluene (methylbenzene) or a derivative.

But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, if the -COOH is replaced by a methyl, the product would be 4-sec-butyl toluene. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

Wait, but if the reaction replaces the -COOH group with a methyl group, then the product would be benzene with a methyl and a sec-butyl in para, which matches option D.

But wait, the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. Could that be a way to reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into a methyl group, releasing CO2 and H2O. So, RCOOH → RCH3.

If that's the case, then the product would have a methyl group where the -COOH was, and the other substituent (sec-butyl) remains.

So, the product would be 4-sec-butyl toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That matches option D.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the reaction mechanism. Let me try to recall.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. The reaction typically involves several steps. For example, RCOOH can first react with HI to form an acyl iodide (RCO-I), which then reacts with red phosphorus to form an alkyl iodide (R-I), and then perhaps further reaction to form R-CH3.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a controlled substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but that wouldn't lead to an alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is converted into a leaving group, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the reaction is not about the carboxylic acid but about the substituent. Maybe the substituent undergoes a reaction.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a branched alkyl chain, perhaps the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is a substitution on the benzylic position.

Wait, benzylic halogenation: when a hydrogen on a benzylic carbon is replaced by a halogen, typically using a halogen and a catalyst. But in this case, the reagents are HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's benzylic position is susceptible to substitution. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the benzylic position would be the CH2 next to the benzene.

So, perhaps the reaction replaces the hydrogen on the CH2 group with iodine, forming a benzyl iodide. But would that be the case with these reagents?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding iodine to the benzylic position. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a radical substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but elimination. If the substituent has a good leaving group, but in this case, the substituent is an alkyl group with no obvious leaving group.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should go back to the options and see which makes sense.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

If the reaction transforms the -COOH group into a methyl group, then the product would be a methyl group in place of the -COOH. So, the substituents would be a sec-butyl and a methyl group in para positions on the benzene ring. That matches option D.

So, the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Another way to think: the reaction converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH3). So, the product is toluene with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Thus, the correct answer would be option D.


Compound X is identified based on its IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, consistent with an O-H stretch, and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The NMR data further supports this, with a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Additionally, the aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

The substituents on the benzene ring are determined from the remaining NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggest a branched alkyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂). Thus, Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into a methyl group (-CH₃). This reaction replaces the acidic proton with a methyl group, resulting in a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions. The final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Among the given options:

- **A)** 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect, as the reaction does not involve the formation of a propanoic acid derivative.
- **B)** 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect, as the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.
- **C)** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect, as this is the starting material, not the product.
- **D)** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct, as the reaction converts the carboxylic acid group into a methyl group, resulting in this product.

Answer: D
