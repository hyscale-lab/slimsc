Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probability. Hmm, let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected these using the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass. But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1's period is P1, P2 is 3P1. Oh wait no, wait: the question says Planet_1 has a shorter period. Oh right, it says Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has period P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits. So the geometry for transit is important here. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But when the orbit is more face-on, the planet is less likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view.

The formula for transit probability is something like R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet must pass within the star's disk for a transit to occur.

Wait, but wait, the exact formula is a bit more precise. I think the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since planets are much smaller than stars, R_plan
