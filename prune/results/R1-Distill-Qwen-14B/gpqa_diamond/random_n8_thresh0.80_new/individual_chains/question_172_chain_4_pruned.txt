Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm... I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. Oh wait, no, wait. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, no, wait again. Oh, no, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation is higher in star_1.

Excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. Oh, wait, no, maybe the ratio of excited atoms to ground state? Or perhaps the ratio of atoms in a particular energy level compared to another. Hmm.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the ΔE. And since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can apply the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors). But the problem
