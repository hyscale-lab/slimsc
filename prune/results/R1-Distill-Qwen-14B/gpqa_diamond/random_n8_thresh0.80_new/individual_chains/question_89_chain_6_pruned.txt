Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with a compound called 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromo would mean there are two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of this structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when such conditions are applied, especially with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), I think about elimination reactions. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, adamantane's structure might have the 1 and 3 carbons being opposite each other or something else. If KOH is used, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, if it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination. Oh, wait, but for vicinal dihalides, elimination gives an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,2-dibromide if the structure is such that 1 and 3 are actually adjacent in some way. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, alternative approach. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region typical for an ether or an alcohol. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which indicates a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a ketone. The IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. 

Wait, the NMR data: 4.79 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That makes me think of something like an -OCH2CH2O- group, like in a diether. But with the carbonyl, perhaps it's a cyclic ether? No, maybe a ketone. Let's think about elimination. So if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH—maybe it's a double elimination to form an allene or a carbonyl?

Wait
