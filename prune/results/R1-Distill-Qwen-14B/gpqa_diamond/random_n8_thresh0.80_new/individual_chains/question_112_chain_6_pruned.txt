Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, but I think I need to normalize this state first because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state has to be a unit vector.

So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So |up> and |down> are orthonormal. 

The first step is to compute the norm of |alpha>. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient. So the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2-i).

Calculating |1+i|²: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2-i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, okay, so the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. So for |up>, it's 2/7, and for |down>, 5/7. Wait no, wait. Wait, the norm is sqrt(7), so the probabilities are (2/7) and (5/7) respectively. Wait no, no, the first coefficient is (1+i), so |1+i|=sqrt(2), so the square is 2. So when normalized, the probability for |up> is (2/7) and |down> is (5/7). So the probabilities are 2/7 ≈ 0.2857 and 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

But wait, the question is not just about the z-projection. The second part is about another operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i !=j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the matrix form of this operator?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states), the operator matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no, wait. Because for a 2x2 system, the indices i and j run from 1 to 2 (or 0 to 1, depending on convention, but let's say 1 and 2). So when i != j, A_ij = ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So this operator is actually (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by ħ/2 gives that matrix.

So the operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of the operator A are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, when multiplied by σ_x. But since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the probabilities will be the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, maybe I can find the expectation value directly, but first, let's focus on finding the probabilities.

So first, what are the eigenstates of A? As I said, they are |+x> = (|up
