Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. 

First, I need to recall that the uncertainty of an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩²). So I'll need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state of the system is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write this vector down:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
     [1/sqrt(2)]
     [ -1/2 ]

So ψ is a 3-dimensional column vector. The first step is probably to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

Looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Since this is a diagonal matrix, the expectation value might be straightforward to compute. Each basis vector is an eigenvector, so the expectation value is just the sum of the components multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but ψ's components are in the P_z basis, right? So each basis vector is an eigenvector of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write ψ in terms of the basis states |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, where |1⟩ is [1,0,0], |2⟩ is [0,1,0], and |3⟩ is [0,0,1].

So ψ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/sqrt(2))|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of each component squared times their respective eigenvalues.

So for |1⟩: (-1/2)^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ
For |2⟩: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0
For |3⟩: (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4

Adding them together: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Wait, but wait a second. Since P_z is the operator, and ψ is a state in its eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So yes, each component's square is the probability, and multiplying by the eigenvalue.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² is:

[ [ħ², 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, ħ²] ]

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the squares of the components multiplied by the squared eigenvalues.

So for each component:

| -1/2 |^2 * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ²
|1/sqrt(2)|^2 * 0^2 = 0
| -1/2 |^2 * (-ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ²

So adding these: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that would be the answer.

Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check. The state vector is given correctly, and in the P_z basis, yes. The expectation value of P_z is zero, correct. For the uncertainty, since P_z is diagonal, the calculation is straightforward. So I think my approach is correct.

I don't think I made a mistake here. So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ divided by the square root of 2. So the correct option is
