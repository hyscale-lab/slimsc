Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are the enantiomers. So, the question is asking which of the given moieties show optical isomerism.

The options are four compounds, and I need to check each one. Let me go through them one by one.

First, the compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I need to figure out which of these have stereoisomerism, specifically optical activity.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Wait, but how about the structure? The substituents are on the same carbon, but is there a possibility of a stereocenter or a plane of symmetry that would prevent optical isomerism?

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to have a center of chirality, then there could be optical isomerism. But wait, biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism around the single bond, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Oh wait, unless the substituents create a chiral center.

Wait, looking at the molecule: it's a biphenyl with two nitro groups on each ring at 6 and 6', and two methyl ester groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each ring. Each ring has two substituents, but are they in positions that would allow for a chiral center?

Wait, no, the substituents are on the benzene rings. The ester groups are on the 2,2' positions, which are on the same positions of each ring. So, the molecule would be symmetric. Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, would that make the molecule achiral?

Wait, but the substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, if I draw the structure, each benzene ring has two substituents: one near (position 2) and one para to that (position 6). Wait, in benzene, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. Oh, wait, no. Benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is next to 2 and 6. So, if a substituent is at 2 and 6, those are adjacent positions. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carbonyl group at 2 (as a carboxylate ester). Hmm.

Wait, but in biphenyl, the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. So, the substituents
