Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, let me list out what's given.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

Hmm. Let's try to figure out what these substances could be.

Starting with reaction 4: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something like that. But let's think about possible gases that could combine. For example, in reaction 4, D and B might be something like HCl and NaOH, but wait, that doesn't make sense because H would be NaCl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3? But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So maybe if C is something like a sulfide, reacting with water could produce H2S (a weak acid) and maybe another acid, but wait, F is strong, so perhaps sulfuric acid? Or nitric acid?

Wait, maybe I should think about the bright red product C. What's a bright red solid that's formed when a metal reacts with a gas? Oh, maybe it's lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4?), but that's dark brown. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like Fe2O3·nH2O, which is reddish. Or maybe it's a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a solid metal with a gas to form a red product. For example, copper reacting with sulfur vapor forms Cu2S, which is a reddish solid. Alternatively, iron with sulfur might form FeS, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe let's think about reaction 4 again: D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Common solvent reactions: maybe D is H2O (but it's a gas?) or perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. Wait, but that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid. Alternatively, D could be H2O and B something else, like Cl2. Wait, but Cl2 is a gas, and if B is Cl2, then D would be something else.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2, D is H2O. But in reaction 4, D + B (Cl2) → H, which is a solvent. Wait, but H2O is a solvent, so maybe reaction 4 is H2O (D) + Cl2 (B) → H? But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 + H2O would form HClO and HCl, which are not pure solvents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else. Wait, but O2 is a gas. Let's think about reaction 1: A is a solid metal reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. For example, if A is iron, B might be Cl2, but 8 equivalents would form FeCl4? Wait, iron usually forms FeCl2 or FeCl3, not FeCl4. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, B is Cl2. Let's say
