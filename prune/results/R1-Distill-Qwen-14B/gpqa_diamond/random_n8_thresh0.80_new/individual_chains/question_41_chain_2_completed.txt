Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving medium, specifically glass. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a medium is moving, it might affect the way light travels through it, but I'm not exactly sure how.

The setup is this: a light beam is moving through glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, the options are given. Let me look at them again. Option B is 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the light is in glass, so its speed should be less than c (which is 1 here). So option B can't be right because that would imply it's moving at speed 1 even though it's in glass. Hmm, so probably not B.

I think the key here is understanding how the velocity of the medium affects the observed speed of light. I remember something about the Doppler effect but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Or maybe it's about adding velocities in relativity?

Wait, but glass is a non-relativistic medium here. Or is v a significant fraction of c? The problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, but it's not specified whether it's relativistic. Hmm, maybe I should consider the Galilean addition of velocities. Oh, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so the observer would see the light's speed as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, but in the glass, the speed of light is c/n. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. Now, if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction, then from the lab frame, the speed of the light would be v_light + v_glass, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, Galilean velocity addition says that the velocity of an object in a moving frame is u' = u + v, where u is the velocity in the object's frame. So in this case, the light's velocity in the glass is u = 1/n (since in the glass's rest frame, it's moving at v = c/n; c is 1 here). So the lab frame would see the velocity as u' = u + v_glass. But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Let me think again. The light is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as the speed in the glass plus the speed of the glass itself. But wait, the speed of the light in the glass is v_light = c/n = 1/n. So from the lab frame, the speed would be v_light + v, which is (1/n) + v. But that doesn't match any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A) (1 + n*v)/(n + v)
Option C) (1 +n*v)/(n -v)
Wait, none of the options is (1/n + v). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if v is a significant fraction of c, then Galilean addition isn't accurate. But the problem doesn't specify whether v is non-relativistic or not. Oh, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Wait, no, that's only in vacuum. In a medium, the speed is lower, but the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion. Wait, in a medium that's moving, the speed of light might change. Or does it? Wait, according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. But wait, that's in a vacuum. How about in a medium? Hmm, that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the speed of light in the moving glass is c/n, and then the glass's velocity adds to it. But if that's the case, the speed observed would be (1/n) + v. But none of the options match this, so I must be missing something.

Wait, another approach: the problem could be about the index of refraction in the moving frame. How does the index of refraction change when the medium is moving? I'm not sure, but perhaps the index is affected.

Alternatively, maybe the observer sees the light moving at v_light = (c/n) + v. But that gives (1/n) + v, which doesn't match any options.

Another thought: maybe the speed of light within the glass, as observed from the lab, is simply c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. Because special relativity says that the speed of light is c in all frames. But wait, that's only for a vacuum. So does the speed of light in a medium depend on the frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. The question is about the speed of light within the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, perhaps the speed is (n + v)/(n v) ? No, that's not matching any options.

Wait, let's think about the frame of the glass. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v1 = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So using the velocity addition formula from special relativity, but that's for frames moving relative to each other without a medium. Hmm, but in this case, the medium (glass) is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps in the lab frame, the speed of light is (v_light + v_glass) / (1 + (v_light * v_glass)/c²). But since here c=1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v), where u is the speed in the glass frame. Wait, u is (1/n) in the glass frame.

So, applying the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame would see the light moving at u', which is (u + v)/(1 + u v) ?

Wait, let me plug in u = 1/n.

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So, u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, that's option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher than in the glass's frame. But using the relativistic formula, it's not just a simple addition. So the result is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's option A. So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is less than (1/n + v) if we have (1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ (1/n) + v*(n)/(n^2) ) when v is small. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it right, but the options don't have that.

But according to the calculation using relativistic addition, it's option A. So I think the answer is A.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory frame. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \). To find the speed of light in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), the relativistic velocity addition formula is applied:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given setup. For example, option B (\( 1 \)) incorrectly assumes the speed of light in a vacuum, which is not applicable here since the light is propagating through a medium. Similarly, options C and D do not match the derived expression.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
