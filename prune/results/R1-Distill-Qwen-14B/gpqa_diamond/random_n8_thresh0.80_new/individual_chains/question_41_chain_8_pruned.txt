Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. And the question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, so first, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, the speed of light within the glass, when the glass is stationary relative to the lab, would be 1/n because c is given as 1. So it's 1/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beamâ€”so if the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too. That might complicate things.

I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition formula here because the glass is moving, and that affects how we measure the speed of the light beam in the lab frame. Oh right, the glass is moving, so the light's speed relative to the lab isn't just 1/n. Because in different frames, velocities add in a certain way.

Wait, but light's speed in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, the medium is moving. So the situation is a bit more
