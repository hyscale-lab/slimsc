Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, the compound is reacted through a series of reagents, and we need to find the final product from the options.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, X=0, N=1. So: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. But perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and a double bond (another one) and maybe an amine or something else.

The NMR data is given. Let me parse it:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe an acidic proton like from a phenol. Wait, but phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm. Wait, 9.72 is more like an aldehyde. But wait, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's the aldehyde group. But the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but aldehydes typically are deshielded and don't split into triplets because they're at the end of the chain. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from a nitro group? No, nitro groups don't have protons. Or maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps it's the proton adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in an enal (enone), the vinylic protons can be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a para-substituted benzene, but no, that's usually around 6.8-7.3 ppm.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm. Maybe it's a vinylogous aldehyde, like a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde with adjacent substituents leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure yet. Let me look at the rest of the NMR.

The next peak is 6.98 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. Then 6.51 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 could be ortho to substituents, while 6.51 could be para, but wait. Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be two doublets each integrating for 2H. Oh, wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of protons. For example, two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions. Or perhaps one substituent causing the two doublets. Wait, no, a para substituent would cause two sets of doublets if there's another group. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. But the integration is 2H each, so maybe two different substituents each causing two protons to split.

Then, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an acidic proton. Or perhaps a di-substituted aromatic ring with coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer? Or perhaps it's a bridge or part of a conjugated system.

Then, 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to something. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH
