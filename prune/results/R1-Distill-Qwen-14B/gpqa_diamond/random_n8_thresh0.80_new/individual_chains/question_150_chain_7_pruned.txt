Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's important. The NMR data is given, so I should probably start by analyzing that to figure out the structure of the starting material.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. High chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, likely aromatic protons. Maybe two equivalent protons in a para-substituted benzene ring?
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, also aromatic. Perhaps another para-substituted group or something else.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. Could be something like an enol proton or maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, maybe CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like O. Possibly an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and an OCH2 group. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsat = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. 

Calculating: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees: probably one ring (from benzene), a double bond, and maybe another ring or double bond? Or maybe two rings and a double bond.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals suggest multiple substituents on a benzene ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two para-substituted benzene rings. Like two phenyl groups attached to something else. 

Wait, the NMR shows 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). If two benzene
