Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack what's being asked here. 

The question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The setup gives some phase shifts, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, phase shifts are related to the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. 

So, the measured phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. They mentioned to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only need to consider these up to l=4. 

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using the partial wave decomposition. The formula I recall is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1)e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ), summed over l from 0 to some maximum. And since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. Because the beam is along the direction, so the scattering angle is zero.

So, when θ=0, cosθ is 1, so the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) must be evaluated. I know that P_l(1) is 1 for any l because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. That might simplify things a lot because each term's angular part becomes 1. 

But wait, the amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part, specifically, is what we're after. Let me think about how to get the imaginary part of f. 

Another thought, the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The general formula for f is f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ) e^{iδ_l} ... wait, no, perhaps I should look at the formula again.

Wait, the exact expression is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l. Also, if we're considering the direction along the beam, I think φ=0, so e^{i l φ}=1. So the formula simplifies to f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) * (1) * (1) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... 

Wait, but wait, the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1)] P_l(cosθ). So the term for each l is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) multiplied by P_l(cosθ), which is 1 when θ=0.

So for each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1). Let me compute this for each l, then sum them up.

But I'm interested in the imaginary part of f along the beam direction. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f at θ=0.

So, first, let's compute each term's contribution. 

The formula for f is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum. So I can write f as (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ].

Wait, but the sum is only up to l=4 since higher phase shifts are ignored.

So, let's compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, let me make sure. The general expression is f = (1/(2ik)) sum ... So, after computing each term, we'll have a sum of terms, each multiplied by (2l+1) and those exponentials.

But I'm only looking for the imaginary part of f, and then along the beam direction (θ=0). So, the steps are:

1. For each l from 0 to 4, compute (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1).

2. Sum all these terms.

3. Multiply the sum by (1/(2ik)).

4. Take the imaginary part of the resulting f.

Wait, let's compute each term. Let me note that each term is a complex number, so I'll have to compute the real and imaginary parts for each l.

But perhaps there's a simplification here. Let me think about the term (e^{i δ_l} - 1). 

We can write e^{i δ_l} = cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). So e^{i δ_l} -1 = [cos(δ_l) - 1] + i sin(δ_l).

Then, multiply this by e^{i δ_l}, which is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So, (e^{i δ_l} -1) * e^{i δ_l} = [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ] * [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ]

Let me compute this product:

= (cos δ_l -1) cos δ_l + (cos δ_l -1) i sin δ_l + i sin δ_l cos δ_l + i^2 sin² δ_l.

Simplify term by term:

First term: (cos² δ_l - cos δ_l)

Second term: i sin δ_l (cos δ_l -1 )

Third term: i sin δ_l cos δ_l

Fourth term: (-1) sin² δ_l

Combine the real parts and the imaginary parts:

Real parts:
cos² δ_l - cos δ_l - sin² δ_l

Imaginary parts: i [ sin δ_l (cos δ_l -1 ) + sin δ_l cos δ_l ]

Simplify real parts:

cos² δ_l - sin² δ_l = cos(2δ_l), but wait, no, wait, cos² x - sin² x is cos(2x), yes. So:
