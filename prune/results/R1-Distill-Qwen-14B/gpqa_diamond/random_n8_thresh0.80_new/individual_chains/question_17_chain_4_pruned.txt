Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to metal ions. The question is about the concentration of Ca²+ ions when it's in a solution with the Ca-EDTA complex. 

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA. But wait, EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form. Oh, but the pH is ideal, so I guess the EDTA is fully deprotonated and ready to bind.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. K here must be the formation constant, Kf. Formation constant is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA might be present as Y^4- or HY^3-, etc., depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess the assumption is that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [EDTA] is the same as the free Y^4- concentration.

So the setup is: we have CaY²− (the complex) at 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+]. 

Let me write the formation equation. The reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Since the complex is 0.02 M, that means [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x and [EDTA^4-] as y. 

So according to Kf, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y). So x * y = 0.02 / 5e10. Let's compute that: 0.02 is 2e-2, so (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x * y = 4e-13.

But wait, the key here is that in the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. Because every mole of CaY uses up a mole of EDTA. So the total [EDTA] is the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2−]. Wait, no, because EDTA is a ligand; each mole of CaY uses one mole of EDTA. So the total EDTA (which I'll call CT) is the sum of free EDTA (y) and the EDTA bound in the complex (0.02 M), right?

Wait, no wait, no. Because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA. So the initial concentration of EDTA would be, let's think about it. Let's say you have a solution where initially, you have EDTA and Ca²+ mixed together. They form the complex. The initial EDTA concentration would be higher than the complex because some of it is tied up in the complex. But in this problem, the complex is 0.02 M, so I think we can assume that the initial EDTA is high enough to form that concentration, but perhaps in reality, the free EDTA would be low.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the only EDTA present is that which is complexed, because the complex is 0.02 M. Hmm, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the total concentration of EDTA species (free and bound) would be the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2−]. Because each CaEDTA has one EDTA in it. So the total EDTA is [EDTA]_total = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2−].

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Therefore, the [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. So EDTA_total = [EDTA^4-] + 0.02 M.

But wait, unless the solution is being made by adding the complex directly, in which case the EDTA in the solution is part of the complex. Wait, no, because the complex is formed when Ca²+ and EDTA are mixed. So in any case, the total EDTA is [ED
