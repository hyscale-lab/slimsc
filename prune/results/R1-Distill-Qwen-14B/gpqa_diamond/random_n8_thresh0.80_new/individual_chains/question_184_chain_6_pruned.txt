Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about figuring out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me count the substituents. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group.

Wait, but how are they arranged on the ring? Let me draw it out mentally. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is on position 1, the tert-butyl on position 2, and the nitro on position 3. So, the substituents are all on adjacent positions, making it a meta arrangement for some of them.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The numbering is such that substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, in such a case, the substituents are adjacent to each other, but considering their directing effects, the order of addition matters a lot.

I need to plan the order in which the substituents are added. Each substitution reaction will direct the next substitution based on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It's ortho/para directing.
- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a deactivating, meta directing group.
- tert-Butyl group: This is a bulky, activating (since it's an alkyl group) and ortho/para directing, but due to its bulk, it's more likely to direct to the para position when possible, but in substitution reactions, the orientation depends on the mechanism.

Since the target has all three substituents, I need to decide the order in which they are introduced. The key here is to consider the directing effects and how the substituents influence each other.

Wait, but let's think about the synthesis steps. For Friedel-Crafts alkylation, we usually use AlCl3 as a catalyst. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is used for alkylation with alkyl halides. However, tert-butyl chloride can undergo Friedel-Crafts, but wait, wait, no! Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tertiary alkyl halides can lead to carbocation rearrangements, like in the case of tert-butyl chloride. Because the tert-butyl carbocation is stable, maybe it doesn't rearrange, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using a bulky group like tert-butyl would be difficult in Friedel-Crafts because of steric hindrance. Hmm, but the question includes it as a possible first step in some options, so perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Oh, wait, the ethoxy group is an ether. To introduce an ether group, perhaps through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more common with deactivating groups. Alternatively, maybe using a Williamson ether synthesis, but that typically involves alkoxide ions attacking an alkyl halide. But for benzene, maybe we can use something like alkylation followed by substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonation followed by something else. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl, and nitro (NO2). The positions are 1, 2, 3. So, the substituents are in the order where each is adjacent to the next.

So, let's consider the order of substitution.

Option 1: Introduce the ethoxy group first. Since it's activating, it will direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Then, introduce nitro group next, which is deactivating and meta-directing. Then, introduce the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, their directing effects can be a bit complex. Let me think. Suppose I start with benzene.

Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group. So, benzene -> ethoxybenzene (anisole). Since it's activating, the next substituents can be added at ortho, para.

Step 2: Next, introduce nitro group. Where would it go? If ethoxy is at position 1, nitro could go to position 3 (meta to ethoxy?), but wait, nitro
