Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think this has to do with complex ion formation and the dissociation of the complex. So let me recall what I know about this. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, so that probably means the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, but I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the complex dissociates a little bit, releasing some Ca²+ ions.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. I think that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = Kf. So, in this case, when the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be much lower because Kf is large, meaning the complex is mostly intact.

Wait, but wait. If the complex is Ca-EDTA, and the initial concentration is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M minus the small amount that dissociates. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] should be small.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium as x. Similarly, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that each dissociation releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So the complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-
Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0
Change: -x, +x, +x
Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, x, x

So the expression for Kf is ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) / [CaEDTA^2-] ) = Kf.

Wait no, because Kf is for the formation reaction. So the reverse dissociation would have Kd (dissociation constant) which is 1/Kf. Because Kf is formation, Kd is dissociation.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- ; Kf = 5e10.

The dissociation reaction is the reverse:

CaEDTA^2- → Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ; Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the equilibrium expression for the dissociation would be:

[Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = Kd = 2e-11.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M because Kd is very small. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both equal to x.

So substituting into the equation:

x * x / 0.02 = 2e-11.

That's x² = (2e-11) * 0.02.

Calculating that, (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, right?

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 * 2 =13. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 which is approximately 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which seems to match.

Let me double-check the math. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So that's 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but another thought. The problem says the solution is containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Does that mean that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA is in excess? Or is the solution just the complex, and the EDTA comes from the dissociation?

No, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex. So, I think the initial assumption is correct. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is minimal, leading to x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

So the answer should be C, 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_d \) is very small). Let the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium both be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02}
\]

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
