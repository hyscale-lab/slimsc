Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of the calcium-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, including calcium. 

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1, right? Because Ca-EDTA is usually a 1:1 complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Wait, what's K here? I think it's the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formation constant (Kf) represents how much the complex will form. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is probably: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but in this solution, the complex is already formed. So I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the complex dissociates a little, releasing some Ca²+ ions.

Let me think about the expression. Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, and assuming it dissociates as CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because Kf is for formation, so Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf.

Wait, is that right? Formation constant is Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), so the dissociation would be the reverse, so Kd = 1/Kf. So yes, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So we have the complex dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So at equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 - x, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both x. But wait, because the stoichiometry is 1:1, the amount of EDTA released is equal to the amount of Ca²+ released.

So the Kd expression would be:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = x * x / (0.02 - x) = x² / (0.02 - x) = 2e-11.

Since Kd is very small (2e-11 is a small number), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That makes the equation approximately x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So solving for x: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = (2*2) * 1e-13 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(10^-13), so square root is 2*(1e-6.5). Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, that's the concentration of Ca²+ ions. Let me check the options. Option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, which matches this calculation.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. The Kd is 1/(5e10) which is 2e-11. The initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M. The assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid because Kd is so small, so the dissociation is minimal.

So yes, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions released at equilibrium. Since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1, the concentration of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) is also \( x \), and the concentration of the complex \( \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \) is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_d \) is very small (\( 2 \times 10^{-11} \)), \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02, so \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \). The equation simplifies to:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
