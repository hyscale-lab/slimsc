Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So the standard Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So X is Li-6. That makes sense.

I need to find the total energy of the ion in the collider. The options are given in GeV, so I think the answer will be in GeV. 

First, I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the mass here is the rest mass of the ion, right?

So the steps I think I need to follow are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma using the given speed of 0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy (m*c²) to get the total energy.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the mass. Do I need to consider the mass of the individual particles or the nucleus as a whole? Oh, right, the nucleus is treated as a single particle with its own rest mass. So I should find the rest mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units (amu), convert that to kilograms, then calculate m*c², and then multiply by gamma.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the u (atomic mass unit) where 1 u = approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m*c² would be mass in u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u. That might be easier because the numbers are manageable.

So let me start by finding the mass of Li-6. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, but when you form a nucleus, mass defect occurs due to binding energy. But maybe for this problem, I should just use the sum of protons and neutrons, or perhaps use the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the individual nucleons. Or maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I can find the exact mass using the periodic table. Let's see. The atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512 u. Hmm, I think the exact value might be 6.01512206 amu. Let me confirm that.

If I recall correctly, the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6.015122 amu. So m = 6.015122 u.

Now, I need to calculate the rest energy m*c². Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², then m*c² is 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 6.015122 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute this. 

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015122 * 931.5 ≈ Let's see: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.00
