Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let's see what I remember from my QFT class.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which I think is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since that's a common source of F.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. For that, I should find the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (since in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so Lagrangian density has dim 4).

Wait, the Lagrangian is in 4D, right? So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

Let me break down the terms:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

So, the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian is κ times that, and the Lagrangian has dim 4, so [κ] + [ψ̄ σ F] = 4.

Wait no, no. Wait, the Lagrangian term is L = κ * (ψ̄ σ F), so the whole thing has to have dimension 4. So the product [κ] * [ψ̄ σ F] = 4. So I need to compute [ψ̄ σ F].

Let me think about the dimensions of each field and operator.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. In 4D, the spinor field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in general, a spinor field in D dimensions has dimension (D-1)/2. 4-1=3, 3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2.

Then, what about ψ̄? Since it's the adjoint, same dimension: [ψ̄] = 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is a tensor made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, I think. So σ is a dimensionless operator. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. Let's say it's from electromagnetism, so F is the field tensor. For electromagnetism, the field tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because in 4D, the Maxwell term is F^2, which has dimension 4 (since (dim F)^2 = 4 → dim F=2). So [F^{mu nu}] = 2.

Now, putting it all together:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the product is:

[ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2. Wait, no, no, sigma is part of the operator in the product. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about this. The term is a product of ψ̄, σ_{mu nu}, ψ, and F^{mu nu}. Each of these contributes their own dimensions.

Wait, ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product is (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * 2. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because sigma doesn't contribute to dimension. Wait, but sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So the operator σ_{mu nu} is made from gamma matrices, so dimensionless.

Wait, but I'm considering the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ. The operator acting on the fields is ψ̄ σ ψ, which in terms of dimension would be [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ], since each gamma is dimensionless. But wait, σ is a combination of gammas, which are dimensionless. So the product [ψ̄][σ][ψ] is (3/2 + 0 + 3/2) = 3. Then multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which is 2. So overall, [ψ̄σψ F] = 3 + 2 = 5?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each ψ̄ and ψ contributes (3/2) each. F contributes 2. Sigma is dimensionless, as it's a product of gamma matrices.

So the term is [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the whole product has dimension 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is L = κ * (ψ̄ σ F), which would have dimension [κ] + 5 = 4. Because the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that would make option A or C possible
