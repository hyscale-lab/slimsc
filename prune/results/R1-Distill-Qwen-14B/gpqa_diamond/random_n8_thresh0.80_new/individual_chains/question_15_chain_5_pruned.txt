Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They've been detected using the radial velocity method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the problem says that Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. Specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. But wait, no, it's the other way around. Oh, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1's would be 100 days. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star.

The host stars have the same radius. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Oh, but same radius. So both stars are similar in size but different in mass. 

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a (1-e^2)^0.5)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s
