Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A through D, some expressions involving n and v. Hmm. I remember that when dealing with the speed of light in different media, the index of refraction plays a role. But how does the movement of the medium (glass) affect this?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So if the glass is stationary, the light's speed would just be 1/n. But since the glass is moving, does that change anything?

I think about the frame of reference here. The observer is in the laboratory, which is presumably an inertial frame. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to this lab frame. So, the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer at velocity v.

But wait, the beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light's direction is the same as the glass's movement.

Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. Oh wait, the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the beam's direction relative to the lab frame is the same as the glass's motion?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the velocity addition formula, like from special relativity. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? So maybe that's the key here. But wait, the light is inside the glass, so its speed is lower than c. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, in the glass, the speed of light is v = c/n. But from the lab frame, which is where the glass is moving, how does that affect the measured speed of the light?

Hmm. Let me think. If the glass is moving, then the observer in the lab would see the light moving at a different speed. But I've heard that the speed of light in a
