Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, usually bicyclic, but limonene itself is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic one. Let me get that right. Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. I think it's a bicyclic molecule, maybe with a five-membered ring and a six-membered ring. But wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene that's actually a bicyclic compound. Hmm.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpeneâ€”specifically, it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a six-membered ring and a five-membered ring. No, wait, I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think. Oh wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a six-membered ring and a five-membered ring. Wait, no, I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, not bicyclic. Or maybe it's a bicyclic monoterpene. I'm a bit unsure here. Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. So, probably a six-membered ring with a double bond and a substituent.

Wait,
