Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with lower pressure, the mean free path increases because there are fewer gas molecules, so they don't collide as much.

The question says Mike designed a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. But some gas particles were still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. So the mean free path was determined to be λ1, considering factors like volume, pressure, and temperature.

But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The temperature stayed the same, so that's not a variable here. Why would λ change when the beam is on?

Wait, the mean free path in the sample compartment is usually determined by the gas pressure and temperature. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule diameter, and P is pressure. Since temperature is the same, λ should depend on pressure and d.

But why did λ change when the beam was on? Oh, maybe the electron beam is causing some effect on the gas molecules. Oh, right! When the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to ionize or become excited. I remember that in electron microscopy, when the electron beam hits the sample, it can cause various effects, including charging the sample, but in this case, the sample is at the same temperature.

Wait, but the gas molecules in the vacuum might get charged by the electron beam. Charged particles interact more strongly with the electric fields, perhaps? Or maybe they get accelerated or deflected by the beam. If the gas molecules are charged, their behavior changes.

Wait, if a gas molecule becomes ionized, it's now charged, so it's affected by the electric fields in the microscope. But in the ultra-high vacuum, the number of gas molecules is already very low. So maybe when the electron beam is on, it imparts some energy to the gas molecules, causing them to move faster. Or perhaps it causes them to be more likely to collide with the chamber walls or other molecules.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be knocked out of the sample compartment. Like, when the electrons hit the gas, they might eject some molecules, which would lower the pressure. But the question says the temperature is the same, so if pressure changed, that would affect λ. But Mike's observation is about mean free path changing, not pressure. Wait, but Mike used the mass spectrometer to detect gas particles before, so maybe the pressure didn't change much.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster, increasing their speed. Since mean free path is proportional to (kT)/(P d²), and if temperature is the same, but pressure changes, then λ would change. But if pressure didn't change, maybe the way the beam affects the molecules' motion changes collision rates.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is the average distance between collisions. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, leading to more frequent collisions with the beam. But wait, the mean free path Mike is measuring is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, right? Or is it about the electrons scattering from the gas molecules?

Wait the question says, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path based on electron scattering with gas molecules was λ2. Oh, so the mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules? Or the gas molecules' movement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

He accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state to be λ1. So that's the mean free path of the gas molecules bumping into each other. But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path (maybe for the electrons) is now λ2. Or perhaps, the mean free path of the gas molecules' movement is now different because of the electron beam.

Wait, but the question says, 'based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.' So when Mike turned on the electron beam, he observed a different mean free path. So perhaps the electrons are more likely to collide with gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path for the electrons. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, or the electrons'?

Wait, the question states: "the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2." So λ1 was the mean free path of the gas molecules, determined when the beam was off. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path (for what?) is now λ2.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path in terms of electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are more likely to interact with the gas molecules, so their mean free path (the average distance an electron travels without scattering) would decrease.

But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile or to move in a way that affects their mean free path. For example, if the electron beam imparts some energy, the gas molecules might have higher kinetic energy, which would increase the mean free path, since higher speed would mean they travel further between collisions.

Wait, but λ is proportional to (kT)/(P d²), and with same T, if pressure P changes, λ changes. But if the electron beam increases the speed (temperature?) but the temperature is same, maybe the pressure is lower because gas is leaving? Or maybe the pressure remains same, but the mean free path changes because the gas molecules are ionized, making their diameter effectively different.

Wait, when a gas molecule becomes ionized, it has a charge, which could affect how it interacts with other molecules. The formula for mean free path uses the diameter d of the molecules. If the molecules are ionized, their effective diameter might change. For example, if a molecule becomes positively charged, perhaps its effective diameter increases because it's more likely to interact with others. Alternatively, maybe ions have a larger effective size because of their charge cloud.

If the effective diameter d increases when the molecules are ionized, then the mean free path λ would decrease, since λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ would decrease.

So in this case, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules become ionized, making their effective diameter larger, hence the mean free path λ2 is smaller than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Which would make the correct answer option C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but wait another thought: at ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is very long. When the electron beam is on, does it cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls or other structures, thus reducing the mean free path? Or perhaps the beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to be scattered, leading to shorter mean free paths.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be more likely to stick to surfaces or be pumped out, which would lower the pressure. If the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases. But the question says the temperature remains the same, but pressure might have changed.

Wait, but the question states that Mike accurately determined the mean free path λ1 under vacuum conditions, so when the beam is off. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2.

If the electron beam affects the gas molecules, perhaps causing them to ionize and thereby have a larger effective diameter, then λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, if the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remained the same, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be lost. For example, if the gas molecules are ionized, they might be drawn towards the walls or pumped away by the vacuum system, effectively reducing the pressure. Lower pressure would increase the mean free path, making λ2 larger than λ1. But that would contradict if the mean free path is determined by the same conditions.

Wait, but the question says that Mike measured λ1 based on factors like sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So perhaps when the beam is on, the pressure in the compartment is lower because some gas is being removed or pumped away due to the beam's effect. If the pressure is lower, the mean free path λ would be longer. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the question says, "upon initiating the electron beam, he made an observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So perhaps the mean free path for electrons is being considered. Electrons have a mean free path determined by how often they scatter off gas molecules. If the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, the electron's mean free path would be shorter.

But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam induces some effect that changes the effective pressure. For instance, the electrons could cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other. Or maybe the presence of the beam reduces the mean free path because the electrons are being scattered more, which affects their path but not the gas's.

Wait, the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, so λ2 is for the gas. So if the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, making their effective diameter larger, then λ2 = (kT)/(P (d')²), where d' > d (since ionized), so λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer would be C.

But wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to be in motion, perhaps due to the energy imparted by the beam, which could increase the effective temperature, but the question states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls, thus reducing their average path. So λ2 would be shorter than λ1.

So putting it all together, λ2 is less than λ1, so the answer is option C.


The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is determined by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the effective diameter of the molecules. In this scenario, Mike initially measured the mean free path of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum state as λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The question asks how λ2 relates to λ1.

When the electron beam is turned on, it can cause ionization of gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective diameter of the molecules due to their charge, which affects the mean free path. The formula for the mean free path is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

Here, \(d\) is the effective diameter of the gas molecules. If ionization increases \(d\), the mean free path decreases because \(d^2\) is in the denominator. Since the temperature remains constant and the pressure does not significantly change, the increase in effective diameter due to ionization leads to a shorter mean free path for the gas molecules. Therefore, λ2 is less than λ1.

Considering the options:

- **A) λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1**: This is incorrect because ionization reduces the mean free path, not increases it.
- **B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect because the electron beam does affect the gas molecules, changing the mean free path.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: This is correct because ionization increases the effective diameter of the gas molecules, reducing the mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1**: This is incorrect because the mean free path does not increase; it decreases.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
