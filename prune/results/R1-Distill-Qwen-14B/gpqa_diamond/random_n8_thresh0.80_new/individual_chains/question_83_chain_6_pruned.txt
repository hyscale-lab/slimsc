Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. Then we titrate that diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part.

First, I think I should find the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Wait, how does dilution work? The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20, making the total 40 cm³. So the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Yes, then 0.001 / 0.04 L is 0.025 M. So diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration. The first part is 25% titration. How much NaOH is added then? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So the equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added. But wait, the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration: 0
