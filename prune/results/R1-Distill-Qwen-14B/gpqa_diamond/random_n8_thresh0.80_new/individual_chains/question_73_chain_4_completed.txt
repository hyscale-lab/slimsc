Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm to find the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, when you have objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So for the relative speed, I think it's when you calculate the speed of one object from the frame of the other. Let me recall, the formula is: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, wait, but wait—since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed is the difference in their speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, let me get that right. If object A is moving at v1 and object B at v2, both in the same direction, from A's frame, B is moving at (v2 - v1) or (v1 - v2) depending on direction. But using the relativistic formula, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait no, wait, actually, if we're finding the speed of B from A's frame, is it (v2 - v1)? Because both are in the same direction, so if v2 is less than v1, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. Suppose in the lab frame, A is moving at v1 and B at v2, same direction. Then from A's frame, B's speed is (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let's plug in the numbers.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7. The negative sign indicates direction; since we're talking about speed as a magnitude, perhaps we take the absolute value. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. Options B and D have 0.14c, but option C says 0.14c as well.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy for each astronaut and sum them.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = approx 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 m c² when rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the relative speed was approximately 0.14c, and the energy is about5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D's energy is 5, which is lower.

Wait another thing, did I calculate the energies correctly? Let me double-check.

First astronaut: v=0.6c.

gamma1 = 1/ sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1.25.

E1=1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c² correct.

Second astronaut: v=0.5c.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 -0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)/1. So sqrt(4/3)=approx 1.1547.

E2=1.1547 *3m c²=3.464 m c². So sum is 2.5 +3.464=5.964, which is about 5.96 mc². So option C.

Wait, but option D has v_rel=0.14c and E=5 mc². So option C is a match for both relative speed and energy.

Wait, let me think again about the relative speed calculation. Wait, I had v1=0.6c and v2=0.5c. So in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. From the first astronaut's frame (moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of the second astronaut?

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Oh wait, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the first object would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So, for B's speed as seen from A's frame, it's (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So substituting the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.142857c. The negative indicates direction—since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which matches what I found earlier.

So putting it together, the correct option is C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but looking back, option B says v_rel=0.1c and E=4.96 mc². So no, that's not matching.

Wait, but wait, another thought: maybe the total energy is calculated using the system's rest frame? Or perhaps I'm summing energies in the lab frame, which is correct.

Wait, in the lab frame, each astronaut has their own energy, so adding the two gives the total energy. So that should be correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
- **Relative Speed**: \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\)
- **Total Energy**: \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\)

From the options, **option C** matches both the relative speed and total energy.
