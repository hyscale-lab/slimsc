Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and in this case, the pion is at rest. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles.

Let me read the problem again. It says Pi(+) is stationary and it decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. Oh wait, and neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think the mass of a neutrino is considered negligible here. So, in this case, the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So the decay reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

But since neutrino's mass is zero, its energy comes solely from its momentum. So E_nu = |p_nu| * c, but since we're working in units where c=1, E_nu = |p_nu|. Similarly, the muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. Wait, actually, the total energy of a particle is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But for the muon, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

However, since we're using MeV and considering rest masses in MeV/c², I think we can just use MeV units where c=1. So the muon's energy is m_mu + K_mu.

Conservation of energy applies here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies. E_final = E_mu + E_nu. And since E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu (since m_nu is negligible), then:

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p_nu.

But also, from momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. So p_mu = p_nu. But the muon's momentum can be found using p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - m_mu^2) ). Because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)/c. Again, in our units, c=1, so p_mu = sqrt(E_mu² - m_mu²).

So p_mu = p_nu → sqrt( (m_mu + K_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 ) = p_nu.

Let me square both sides to simplify the equation.

So ( (m_mu + K_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 ) = p_nu².

Expanding (m_mu + K_mu)^2: m_mu² + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu².

Subtract m_mu², so we get 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu² = p_nu².

But from the energy equation: 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p_nu.

Wait, let me write that as p_nu = 139.6 - (105.7 + K_mu) → p_nu = 33.9 - K_mu.

So substitute p_nu into the equation: (2 * 105.7 * K_mu) + K_mu² = (33.9 - K_mu)^2.

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu² = 211.4 K_mu + K_mu².

Right side: (33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu
