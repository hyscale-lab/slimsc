Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting my head around wave functions and probability densities. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait—wait a second. The wave function is usually a complex function, right? So having an imaginary part makes sense, but I'm not sure how that affects the normalization. Oh, right, the normalization condition is about the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space being 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Or wait, no—the question says that particles were only found in x between 1 and 3, meaning that the wave function is non-zero only there. So the wave function ψ(x) is zero when x < 1 and x >3, and given by that expression in between.

Wait, no, the question says that when they measured, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. But the given expression is for a part of space where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, and the given function is valid between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but the square root of (1 + x) might cause issues if x is less than -1, but in our case, since x is between 1 and 3, 1+x is between 2 and 4, so sqrt is positive, no problem.

So the first thought is to normalize the wave function. The integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because that's the condition for normalization.

Let me write down the wave function:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i

But wait, wait a second—what's the wave function look like? Because the expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if ψ(x) is a function that's a combination of a real term and an imaginary term, then the modulus squared would be |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b².

But wait, no, let me think again. The expression is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5). Wait, but that can't be right because when you square it, it would have a term with 0.25, but I'm not sure about the integral. But perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function should be such that the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 is 1. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the modulus squared of a complex number (a + ib), it's a² + b². So in this case, a is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and b is -0.5, so b² is 0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So let's set up the integral. Let me write that:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let's compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|, so evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 3 - 1 = 2.

Putting it back into the equation:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * 0.6931 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take the square root to find a:

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the closest. But wait, did I do that correctly?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is ln(1+x) from 1 to 3.

At x=3, it's ln(4). At x=1, it's ln(2). So the difference is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), which is correct.

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second term: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So equation: a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 =1 → a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.

But wait, I'm a bit concerned because the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. Is that possible? Because usually, for a stationary state, the wave function can be purely real or purely imaginary, but in this case, it's a mix. Hmm, but perhaps that's acceptable. Because the Schrödinger equation allows for complex wave functions, but the probability density would still be |ψ|².

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the wave function. The given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Maybe it's not a sum but a multiplication? Or perhaps the entire term is a complex number, but that's how I took it.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Wait, that would make the real and imaginary parts both depend on x. But that's a different scenario. Because the way it's written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a function where the real part depends on x and the imaginary part is a constant. Which is a bit odd but possible.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i, meaning that the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). But that would mean that the imaginary part is a constant, which seems a bit odd because usually, the real and imaginary parts depend on x. But perhaps that's the case here.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, which is what I used earlier. So the calculation should be correct.

So the value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) equals 1. The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot 0.6931
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5
\]

### Combining Both Terms:
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot 0.6931 + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract \(0.5\) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \cdot 0.6931 = 0.5
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Take the square root to find \(a\):

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
