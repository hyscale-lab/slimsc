Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on several factors.

The question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the other. Both planets have circular orbits.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, but also on the orbital distance. Wait, another factor is the inclination of the orbit. For a transit to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability of that is higher when the star is more massive, I'm not sure. No, wait, maybe it's more about the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius.

Wait, the equation for transit probability is something like P = (R_p)/(a) * (something else), but I'm not exactly sure. Or maybe it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the star's radius (R_s), and the planet's size. Oh, right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) / (R_s / a), but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - eÂ²))), but since both have circular orbits, e is zero. So that part simplifies to 1. So P = (R_p / R_s) * (1/(a * (something))). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's the planet's orbital distance relative to the star's size. Oh, wait, the probability is actually related to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in the sky such that it passes in front of the star. Since the star's size is
