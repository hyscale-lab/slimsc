Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what each of these products could be. The reactions involve solid A reacting with gas B, then product C reacting further, etc. Let's break it down.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a red product formed from a solid reacting with a gas. Maybe something like copper reacting with chlorine? Copper is a solid, and when it reacts with chlorine gas, it forms CuCl2, which is blue. Hmm, not red. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, I remember that when aluminum reacts with something, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving iron? Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but that's when it's formed with oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas to form a compound. Oh, another thought: sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl, which is white. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal forming a colored compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is between a metal and sulfur. Sulfur is bright yellow, but when it reacts with a metal like iron, it forms FeS which is black. Not red. Wait, maybe it's a different scenario. Oh, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen. Let me think. Copper and chlorine form CuCl2, which is blue, but maybe in some other condition it's a different color? Or perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and another gas, like O2 or Cl2, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with solid A. Let me think about what could require 8 equivalents. Each Cl2 molecule has two Cl atoms, so 8 equivalents would be 8 moles per mole of A, perhaps. Wait, but let's think about the stoichiometry. If A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 moles of Fe. So 8 equivalents would mean a lot of Cl2. Maybe the formula isn't FeCl3, but something else.

Wait, another approach: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of compounds like mercury(II) chloride, which is red, but that's more of a white or pale red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal complex. Wait, maybe it's lead(II,IV) oxide, which is red. But that's when oxygen is involved. Alternatively, maybe it's an iodide or bromide? Or perhaps a sulfide? No, sulfides are usually black or yellow. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is between a metal and another gas. Oh! What about the reaction of sodium with chlorine gas? 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's white, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product C is a nitride? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a diatomic gas, but I'm not getting the right color. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the next step.

The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C plus 2 D → E. What's extremely hazardous? Maybe something like phosgene? Or perhaps a toxic gas like H2S? Wait, but phosgene is a gas, but in this case, E is a product, so maybe it's a solid? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C reacts with D, maybe D is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2.
