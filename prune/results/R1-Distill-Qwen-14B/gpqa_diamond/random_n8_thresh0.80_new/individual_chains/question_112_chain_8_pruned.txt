Okay, I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. 

Then, the problem mentions an operator with a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So I should figure out what kind of operator this is. Wait, the indices i and j probably refer to the basis states. Since the electron is spin-½, the basis is |up> and |down> so the matrix would be 2x2.

So the matrix A would look like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Because when i ≠ j, it's hbar/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. 

Wait, but the question says: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

But first, let me normalize |alpha>. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b = (2-i).

The normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2. 

|a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i) has magnitude sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

|b|^2: (2-i): 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

The eigenstates of A (same as σ_x) are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote
