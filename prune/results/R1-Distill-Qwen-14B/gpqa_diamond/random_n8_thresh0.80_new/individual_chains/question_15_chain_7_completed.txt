Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit. Let me think through this.

The question involves two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3. Also, their host stars have the same radii but different masses. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, but the probability of a transit depends on the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I think actually it's more like the area. Oh wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Hmm, no, wait, the probability is approximately the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. Or more precisely, the probability is (R_star / a) divided by something else? Or wait, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since planet radius is much smaller than star, it's roughly R_star / a times some factor.

Wait, I think the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_p)² / (a²), but no, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, right, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because it's the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough.

Wait, no, I think the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. Wait, actually, the exact probability is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh! I remember now. The probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_star)). But since R_p is much smaller than R_star, that term is negligible. So P ≈ R_star / a.

Wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a) * (something). Or perhaps it's the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Hmm. Oh, wait, the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a)^2 * (sqrt(1 - e²)) / (1 + (a(1-e²)^(3/2)) / (R_star))), but since these are circular orbits (e=0), it simplifies. So for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a) * (R_star / (2a)) )? No, perhaps not. Wait, another approach: the probability is the area of the circle where the planet's path would cross our line of sight, divided by the total possible area. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but again, since R_planet is much smaller, that term is ignored. So P ≈ R_star / a.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Another way: the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So P ∝ R_star / a.

Wait, but I think I might have that reversed. Because if a is smaller (closer planet), then the chance of transit is higher. Because the orbit is a smaller circle, so the area where the transit can occur is larger in proportion to the orbit. Hmm, no, that's not right. Let me think in terms of geometry. The probability is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit—no, maybe the radius.

Wait, here's a better approach. The transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a / R_star)) ), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the standard formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5) ), but since e=0, it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star/a.

Wait, no, I'm pretty sure that the transit probability increases when the orbital distance a is smaller because the planet is more likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view. So, for two planets around different stars, you need to calculate their probabilities.

Wait, but the stars have the same radius, right? The question says both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same R. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, the probability for each planet is P = (R / a) * something. But wait, I think I'm missing a factor. Let me check.

In the transit method, the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 for both, it's (R_star / a) multiplied by 1. So P = R_star / a.

Wait, wait—that's not correct. Another source I remember says that the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) divided by a, but that's not exactly right either.

Wait, perhaps it's (R_star / a) times (something else). Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet could pass in front of the star. But the exact formula is a bit tricky.

Actually, the correct formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_star + R_planet)) )) or something like that. Hmm, perhaps I should refer to the formula as I remember.

Wait, I think the correct probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but for circular orbits (e=0), it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star/a.

Wait, but even more accurately, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but again, e=0, so it's (R_star + R_planet)/a.

But in this problem, the stars have the same radius, and the planets are Earth-like, so their radii are similar, much smaller than the stars. So R_planet is much less than R_star, so R_star + R_planet ≈ R_star.

Therefore, the probability for each planet is P ≈ (R_star) / a.

But wait, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_star + M_planet) P^2)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2)/(4π²). Therefore, a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Given that, since both planets have the same mass, but different periods and host star masses.

So, for each planet, a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

But wait, the problem says that the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P_1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, let's define P2 as P, so P1 is P/3.

So, for a_1 (Planet_1's semi-major axis):

a1 ∝ (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) = (2 M2)^(1/3) * (P/3)^(2/3) = (2)^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P^2)/(3^(2/3)) )^(1/3).

Wait, wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

a1 = k * (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3),
a2 = k * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3),

where k is a constant from Kepler's law.

Since M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2/3,

a1 = k * (2 M2)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3)
= k * (2)^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P2^(2/3)) / (3)^(2/3)
= k * (2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * (M2 P2^2)^(1/3).

But a2 = k * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3),
so a2 = k * (M2 P2^2)^(1/3).

So, a1 = (2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * a2.

Let me compute 2^(1/3) divided by 3^(2/3):

2^(1/3) = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26,
3^(2/3) = cube root of 9 ≈ 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Hmm, so a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

But the transit probability is P = R_star / a.

Since R_star is the same for both (because both host stars have the same radius), the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 = (R_star) / a1,
P2 = (R_star) / a2.

So P1 / P2 = (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 ≈ 0.6 a2,

a2/a1 = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is about 1.6667 times P2.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

a1 = (2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * a2.

So 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26, 3^(2/3) is 3^(1/3) squared. 3^(1/3)= about 1.442, so squared is about 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Thus, P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 P2.

So, the probability for Planet_1 to transit is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait—since the question is about which planet has a higher probability, the researchers would prefer to observe the one with higher P.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability (about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2).

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than that. So which is it?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)).

Compute 2^(1/3) = 2^(0.3333) ≈ 1.2599.

3^(2/3) = (3^1/3)^2 ≈ (1.4422)^2 ≈ 2.0801.

So 1.2599 / 2.0801 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So P1 = R / a1 = R/(0.605 a2) = (R/a2) * (1/0.605) ≈ 1.653*(R/a2).

And P2 = R/a2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So, Planet_1 has higher probability, so the researchers would choose Planet_1. So option C or D.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) says ~2.7 times, which is higher. So why would that be? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up which planet is which. Let me double-check.

Wait, the planet with the shorter period (Planet_1) has a smaller a, because, according to Kepler's law, shorter period implies closer orbit for a given mass.

Wait, let me clarify, M is twice as much for Planet_1's star.

So, for a given period, a would be smaller if M is larger. Since M1 is twice M2, for same period, a1 would be smaller than a2 by a factor of (M2/M1)^(1/3) = (1/2)^(1/3) ≈ 0.7937. But Planet_1 has P1 = P2/3.

So, a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 ∝ (2)^(1/3) * (P/3)^(2/3).

So, a1 = (2)^(1/3) * (P^(2/3)) / (3^(2/3)) ).

a2 is for Planet_2: a2 ∝ (1)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) = P^(2/3).

So, a1 = (2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * a2.

Which is the same as before, giving a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Then, transit probability is inversely proportional to a, so higher a means lower P.

So Planet_1 has a lower a, higher transit probability.

Which aligns with our previous calculation.

So, the ratio is ~1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \).

### Step 1: Relating orbital distance to period and mass
From Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to:
\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3},
\]
where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has a host star mass \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \) and orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).
- Planet_2 has a host star mass \( M_{\text{star,2}} \) and orbital period \( P_2 \).

Thus, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{\left( M_{\text{star,1}} \cdot P_1^2 \right)^{1/3}}{\left( M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}} = \frac{\left( 2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3}}{\left( M_{\text{star,2}} \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2^{1/3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}}{1}.
\]

### Step 2: Numerical calculation
Using approximations for the cube roots:
- \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \),
- \( 3^{2/3} \approx 2.08 \),

we find:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \).

### Step 3: Transit probability ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
