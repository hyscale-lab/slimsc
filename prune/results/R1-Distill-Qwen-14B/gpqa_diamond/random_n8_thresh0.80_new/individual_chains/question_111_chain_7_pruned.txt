Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water. Both reactions are probably some kind of addition or condensation, maybe a Claisen or aldol reaction, or maybe something else. Let me think.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl and ethyl groups, respectively. Wait, wait, no, 2-ethyl would be a larger substituent. Wait, the structure: cyclohexane with a ketone at carbon 1. Carbon 2 has an ethyl group, and carbon 6 has a methyl group? Or perhaps I should draw the structure. Ok, let me imagine it: the cyclohexane ring, the ketone is at position 1 (so the ring is numbered such that 1 is the carbonyl). Then position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. So the substituents are at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl), along with the ketone at 1. So the molecule would look somewhat like a chair conformation where position 1 is axial or equatorial, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. So I'm thinking this is an example of the Claisen condensation or perhaps some kind of conjugate addition. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. So the reaction with a ketone might be a Michael addition followed by a Claisen-like reaction? Or perhaps it's a conjugate addition to the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So the ketone could undergo enolate formation. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it would deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the alpha
