Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that when we're dealing with atoms in stars, it's often about the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small part of the star's atmosphere behaves like a perfect blackbody at a certain temperature.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, I recall that the Boltzmann factor is used to find the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two states, which is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k times temperature).

So the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2. Let me write that down. Let’s denote N1 as the number of excited atoms in star_1 and N2 for star_2. So N1/N2 = 2.

According to the Boltzmann equation, that ratio should be equal to exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), but wait, I need to get the signs right. Because higher energy states have lower populations. Oh wait, the formula is N_i / N_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E is the energy of a higher state, E_i would be higher than E_j if i is the excited state.

Wait, actually, the formula is N_i / N_j = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j. So in this case, star_1 has higher excitation, which means that the higher energy level is more populated compared to star_2.

Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So in star_1, the higher energy level (let's say level 2) is more populated than in star_2. So N1/N2 = 2. But N1 corresponds to the higher energy level, and N2 is the lower one? Or wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the populations in the same energy levels in each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in each star. So for star 1, the ratio is N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 times (N2_excited / N2_ground). Because the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio N1/N2 for the excited state is 2 times the ratio of the lower state? Or maybe I should think in terms of each star's own ratio.

Wait, maybe each star has its own ratio of excited to ground state. So for star 1, the ratio R1 = N1_excited / N1_ground, and for star 2, R2 = N2_excited / N2_ground. The question says R1 is twice as much as R2, but wait, no. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Hmm, perhaps I should think that in star_1, the excited state has twice the population of the same state in star_2, but that might not be the right way to interpret it.

Wait, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same energy level, the number of excited atoms (in that level) is higher in star_1. But that doesn't directly make sense because the same energy level would have a different population based on the star's temperature. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the relative excitation compared to each other, like the ratio of excited to ground states.

Wait, perhaps I should model it this way: for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, R1 = (N1_e / N1_g) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, R2 = (N2_e / N2_g) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

The question states that R1 is twice R2, because star_1's excited level is twice as much as star_2's. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write that equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Let me rearrange the terms inside the brackets:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the equation I have is:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me double-check the math. Let me factor 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, no, that's correct because:

1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's right. So substituting back:

(ΔE / (k )) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the options don't have the ΔE term, so perhaps the given equation relates to the ratio of T1 and T2. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, another approach: When I set up the equation, I have R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which is same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps I need to find a relation between T1 and T2 without involving ΔE. Hmm, but the problem states that the energy difference is given, so maybe it's not needed, and perhaps the options have a more general form.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what ΔE/(k) is.

k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So that ratio is 1 K. So substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1*T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J.

To analyze the situation, the Boltzmann distribution is applied. The ratio of the populations of atoms in two energy states is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{excited}}}{N_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2R_2 \). Substituting this into the equations:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
