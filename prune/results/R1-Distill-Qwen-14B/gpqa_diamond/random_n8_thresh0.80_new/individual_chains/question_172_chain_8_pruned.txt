Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play because it's about how particles distribute themselves among different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the excitation is related to the probability of an atom being in a higher energy state, which depends on temperature and the energy difference between states.

The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—like Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh right, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k times some temperature-related term? Hmm, maybe not directly. Or perhaps it's part of the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So here, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by that exponential. Since the problem mentions that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, I think the ratio would be (n1)/(n2) = 2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is (n2)/(n1) = 2? Wait, no, wait. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for the same energy level, the number in star_1 is higher. So, n1 = 2 * n2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

So according to Boltzmann, n1/n2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ). Wait, because E_i and E_j are the two energy levels. Let's say E_i is a higher energy level than E_j. So for the same atom, the probability of being in E_i is lower than E_j. So in our case, n1 is the number in the excited state, and n2 is the number in the lower state. Wait, but in the problem, it's the same energy level in both stars. So perhaps it's the same E_i and E_j for both stars, but the ratio depends on each star's temperature.

Wait no, the problem
