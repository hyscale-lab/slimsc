Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Here's what I know: Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms acetate ions. The problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of the acetic acid and NaOH, and asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me jot down the given data.

We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. 

The acetic acid (CH3COOH) concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L. So, M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, that's right? Let me think. Oh yeah, because when you dilute it, the moles stay the same. So moles = M1*V1 = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it.

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

I think I should calculate the pH at both these points.

First, let's find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, wait! Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles remain 0.001.

So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH must be 0.001 mol, because each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, the question says '25% titration'. I think that refers to 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So that
