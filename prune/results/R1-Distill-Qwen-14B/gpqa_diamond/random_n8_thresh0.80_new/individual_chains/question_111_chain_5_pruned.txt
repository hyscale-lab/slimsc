Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the questions are.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. We have to choose the major products A and B from the options given.

Starting with the first reaction. I remember that when ketones react with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, it's probably a Claisen or Aldol addition. Wait, but acrylates are used in the Michael addition, or maybe it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a crossed aldol reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1 (if I'm numbering correctly). Wait, the numbering of cyclohexanones usually starts with the ketone as position 1. So, 2-ethyl would be adjacent to the ketone, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. So, the ring has a ketone at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Oh wait, no. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, on C2, there's a methyl and an ethyl group. And C6 has a methyl. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1, methyl at C2 and C6, and an ethyl at C2.

When this reacts with ethyl acrylate (which is a substituted acrylate, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), and t-BuOK, I think it's an example of a conjugate addition, perhaps a Michael addition. In this case, the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone to form an enolate.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is a aldol condensation. But since ethyl acrylate is the nucleophile, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Let me think: the ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The enolate would form at the alpha position relative to the ketone, which in this case is position 2 (since the ketone is at position 1, the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6 perhaps). Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbons adjacent to the ketone (C1) are C2 and C6. So C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl.

But if the base abstracts a proton from C2 or C6, forming the enolate
