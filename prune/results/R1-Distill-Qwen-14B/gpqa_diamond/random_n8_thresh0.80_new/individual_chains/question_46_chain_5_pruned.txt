Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. 

Wait, let me remember what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a ruthenium-based catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between olefins, right? So it breaks and reforms the double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers, but wait, does that matter here? In metathesis, I think the stereochemistry might play a role, but maybe not in the number of products. Let me think.

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait no, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH2? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3 but wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, wait. Let me number the carbons.

Pent-1-ene: positions 1-5. So 1 and 2 are double-bonded. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on carbon 3.

So, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl at position 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that's four carbons. Oh wait, no, five in total. Oh, I think I got it wrong. Let me draw it.

Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene:

Carbon 1: CH₂=CH-

Carbon 2: connected to carbon 3.

Carbon 3: has a methyl group and is connected to carbon 2 and 4.

So, the molecule is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, wait, that's five carbons in total. So the structure is CH₂=CH-
