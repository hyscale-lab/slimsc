Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I guess activity coefficients are 1, simplifying things.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms a complex with metal ions. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is the formation constant, Kf. Oh right, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That makes sense because if you add Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts, they'll form the complex. But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds the calcium, so the free Ca²+ should be low.

Let me think about the expression for Kf. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, if all the Ca and EDTA form the complex, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I think I need to consider the initial concentrations.

Wait, no, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of Ca in the solution is tied up in this complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero, and upon adding, they form the complex. Or maybe I should model it as all the Ca is in the complex.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The K for the dissociation would be the inverse of Kf, so Kdissociation = 1/Kf. Because Kf is formation, and Kdissociation is for breaking apart.

So the dissociation reaction is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. And since Kf is 5e10,
