Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let me try to unpack the steps and reactions involved here.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane skeleton.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since it's dibromide, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs. Wait, but with two bromines, would it eliminate twice? Or maybe it's a substitution. Oh wait, KOH in such conditions might cause a double elimination, leading to the formation of an epoxide? Or wait, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane on treatment with KOH. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the bromines are in adjacent positions on the structure. But wait, 1 and 3 positions on adamantane are not adjacent. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused in a specific way. The 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in the structure, perhaps.

Wait, when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), treatment with a strong base like KOH can lead to elimination to form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene. Wait, but 1,3 are not adjacent in the structure. Oh, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond.

Wait, actually, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to a diene? Or maybe each Br leaves, but that would require two eliminations, so perhaps forming two double bonds. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated but in a different position.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of an epoxide. Oh, because when vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, they
