Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm⁻¹. So, the compound must have an ester functional group, which means the formula will include an oxygen from the ester. Since it's an ester, the structure probably has a COO group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's categorize them.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests there are two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents would cause different environments for the aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons (ortho and meta to substituents). But wait, di-substituted could also be ortho, meta, or para. Hmm, but the number of signals depends on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each has two unique aromatic protons. So, perhaps each substituent is causing two different environments. Wait, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene. Then, the protons would be in two different meta positions relative to each substituent. Or maybe it's a 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would split the aromatic protons into two sets.

Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons would be in two equivalent pairs. So, two signals for the aromatic H's.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an ester group. Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, but if another substituent has a double bond, like an allyl group or a substituent with a double bond, then the vinyl Hs would come from that.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring. So, substituents are two groups attached to the benzene ring. One of them is an ester group, perhaps. Then what's the other substituent?

Wait, the ester is an O-CO-O group? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', right? So, if the benzene ring has an ester group as a substituent, the other substituent would be another group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So, maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group, like an allyl group or a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, but if the other substituent is an ester, then where do the vinyl Hs come from? Hmm, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, like an allyl group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that has
