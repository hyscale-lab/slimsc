Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars doesn't get sparser as we go further out. But wait, how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax, plx, is a measure of how far away a star is from us. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, and for 0.5, it's 2 parsecs, and so on.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, I need to find how N, the number of stars, depends on the parallax range.

Since the distribution is uniform, the number density of stars (let's say n) is constant. So more stars would be in a larger volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, we're dealing with a range of distances. So if we're looking at stars within a certain distance, the number would be proportional to the volume up to that distance.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. Let me think. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let's denote plx as p, so distance d = 1/p.

Suppose I have a range of plx
