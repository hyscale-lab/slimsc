Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about reactions and figuring out the molecular symmetry group of a product. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

The problem starts by describing some reactions. Let's break them down one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with a gas in such a high ratio to make a red product. Oh, wait, maybe sulfur reacting with something? Because I remember sulfur is bright yellow but maybe in a different form it's red. Or perhaps another element. Wait, maybe it's about copper? Copper can form different compounds. Alternatively, maybe it's about lead or something else.

Wait, bright red product C suggests it's a compound with a specific color. I'm trying to recall, lead dioxide is dark brown, so maybe not. Oh! What about the reaction of sodium sulfide (solid) with sulfur (gas)? Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a sulfide or a similar compound.

Wait, another thought: the reaction forms product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Plus, C reacts with water to form A again plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So the reaction with water breaks C down into A and acids.

So, when C reacts with water, it's hydrolysis. Let's think about what C could be. If C is a sulfide, maybe? Because sulfides can hydrolyze to produce S (sulfur) and some acid. Wait, but if C is a sulfide and reacts with water, it might produce H2S (a weak acid) and maybe another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride? No, nitrides usually hydrolyze to NH3 and such, not acids.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is a metal, like sodium. Sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacts with something. But when it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH and H2S, but that's a weak acid. Hmm, but the problem says two different acids. So maybe C is something like a metal dichloride or another compound that would release two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about E. E is formed when C reacts with D. E is extremely hazardous. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1
