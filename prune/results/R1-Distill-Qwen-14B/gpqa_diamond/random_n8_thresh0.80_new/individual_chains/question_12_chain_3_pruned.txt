Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I guess the neutrino is considered massless because I don't remember its mass being significant in these kinds of problems. So that would make things a bit simpler.

Wait, so the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That means their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I remember that in such decay processes, the energy and momentum are shared between the products. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. This energy is split between the muon and the neutrino.

Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy after decay should equal the total energy before. So:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

E_pi is just the rest mass energy, so 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. But wait, since we're working in units where c=1, it's just m_mu + K_mu. So m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

E_nu is the energy of the neutrino, which is just its momentum times c, but again, in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu. Let me denote p as the magnitude of their momenta.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p)^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → but again, units are such that c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

And E_nu = p.

So putting it all together:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, that's an equation with p as the variable. I need to solve for p.

Let me denote m_mu as m for simplicity. So m = 105.7.

Equation becomes:
139.6 = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me subtract p from both sides:
139.6 - p = sqrt(p² + m²).

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root.

(139.6 - p)^2 = p² + m^2.

Expanding the left side:
(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p² = p² + m².

Simplify by subtracting p² from both sides:
(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p = m².

Move all terms except the p term to the right:
-2 *139.6 * p = m² - (139.6)^2.

Multiply both sides by -1:
2 *139.6 * p = (139.6)^2 - m².

So,

p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

Wait, 139.6² = (approx) let me calculate.
