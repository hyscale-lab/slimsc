Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about an electron state and some measurements involving an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so first I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the normalization. Right, because the state isn't normalized yet. So I'll have to find the normalization constant.

Let me write down the state. Let's denote |up> as |↑⟩ and |down> as |↓⟩. So |alpha> = (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 - i)|↓⟩. But it's proportional to that, so perhaps the actual state is |alpha> = c[(1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 - i)|↓⟩], where c is the normalization constant. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as proportional, so maybe I can just compute the norm of the given vector and then normalize it.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So for the given expression, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute |1+i|² and |2-i|².

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 = 7. So the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑⟩ + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |↓⟩.

Now, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, the matrix is 2x2 because it's spin-up and spin-down. So the matrix would be:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0    ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm, but wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, so the operator is acting on spin states. Wait, but what's the operator's eigenbasis?

Wait, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think about what this operator represents. Oh, wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is diagonal. So if I look at A, it's (ħ/2) times σ_x. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A as well, because A is a multiple of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A will be ± (ħ/2).

Wait, but the question is about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of operator A. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, because the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients in that basis.

So first, what are the eigenstates of A? Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2. Let me confirm that. Because σ_x flips the spin, so the eigenstates are superpositions.

Wait, let me compute the eigenvectors. For σ_x, the equation σ_x |v⟩ = λ |v⟩. The eigenvalues for σ_x are +1 and -1.

For λ=+1: (σ_x - I)|v⟩=0 → [[ -1 1 ], [1 -1 ]] |v> = 0. So the first row gives -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is (1,1), normalized as (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2.

Similarly, for λ=-1: (σ_x + I)|v⟩=0 → [[1 1], [1 1]] |v> =0 → v1 = -v2 → eigenvector (1,-1), normalized as (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/√2.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and |−x⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/√2. The eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(−1), respectively.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in the basis of |+x⟩ and |−x⟩. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap of |alpha> with |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, and then the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of those overlaps.

So let's compute the coefficients. Let me write |alpha> as c1 |+x⟩ + c2 |−x⟩.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products. Let me compute ⟨+x | alpha ⟩ and ⟨−x | alpha ⟩.

First, ⟨+x | is (⟨↑| + ⟨↓| ) /√2.

Similarly, ⟨−x | is (⟨↑| - ⟨↓| ) /√2.

So let's compute ⟨+x|alpha⟩.

|alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |↑⟩ + (2 -i)/√7 |↓⟩.

So:

⟨+x|alpha⟩ = [ (⟨↑| + ⟨↓| ) /√2 ] * [ (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 -i)|↓⟩ ) /√7 ]

= [ ( (1+i)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (2 -i)⟨↓|↑⟩ ) + ( (1+i)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (2 -i)⟨↓|↓⟩ ) ) ] / (√2 * √7 )

But wait, since ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩=1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩=0, ⟨↓|↑⟩=0.

So it simplifies to:

= [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 0 ) + ( (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ) ] / (√14 )

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / √14

Wait, wait, no, let me see again. The first term in the numerator is (1+i) from ⟨↑|↑⟩ and (2-i) from ⟨↓|↑⟩. But ⟨↓|↑⟩ is zero, so that term is (1+i)(1) + 0. Similarly, the second part is (1+i)⟨↑|↓⟩ which is zero, and (2-i)*⟨↓|↓⟩ which is 2-i. So adding these together:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3, because (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 +0=3.

So ⟨+x|alpha⟩ = 3 / sqrt(14) ?

Wait, no, let me recheck. The calculation is:

⟨+x|alpha⟩ = [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*0 ] + [ (1+i)*0 + (2-i)*1 ] ) / (√2 √7 )

Which is [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(14) → (3) / sqrt(14).

So that's 3/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is (9)/(14). So the probability of measuring +x is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, let's compute ⟨−x | alpha⟩.

⟨−x | alpha⟩ = [ (⟨↑| - ⟨↓| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2 -i)|↓⟩ ) / sqrt(7) ]

Which is [ (1+i)⟨↑|↑⟩ - (2-i)⟨↓|↑⟩ ) + ( (1+i)⟨↑|↓⟩ - (2-i)⟨↓|↓⟩ ) ) ] / (√2 * √7 )

Again, cross terms are zero.

So it's [ (1+i) - 0 + 0 - (2-i)*1 ] / sqrt(14) 

Wait, let me break it down:

First term: (1+i)*1 + (2-i)*0 → (1+i)

Second term: (1+i)*0 - (2-i)*1 → -(2-i)

So sum is (1+i) - (2-i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the numerator is (-1 + 2i). So the inner product is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait a minute, that would sum to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is good. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

So the probability of measuring |+x> is 9/14 ≈0.64, and |−x> is 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which seems close. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

C) 0.28, 0.72... no, no.

Wait, but wait, when I computed ⟨+x|alpha⟩, I got 3/sqrt(14) which is about 3/(3.7417) ≈0.799. The absolute square is (3^2)/(14) =9/14≈0.6428. Hmm, so 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64.

The other probability is 5/14≈0.357, which is about 0.36 when rounded. So that would match option A's first two probabilities.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value ⟨A⟩ is the expectation value: ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

But since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, this is (ħ/2) ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since σ_x is the Pauli matrix, and the expectation value of σ_x in a state |psi> is given by 2 Re[ ⟨up| psi ⟩ ⟨psi | down ⟩ ].

Wait, wait, another approach: the expectation value of σ_x can be found using the coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of σ_x, which we found earlier. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x>, respectively. So the expectation value is p*(+1) + (1-p)*(-1) )= 2p -1, where p is the probability of |+x⟩.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of an operator is the sum over eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities. So if the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is p=9/14, and the other is q=5/14, the expectation would be (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= ( (9-5)/14 ) (ħ/2 )= (4/14)(ħ/2 )= (2/7)(ħ/2 )= ħ/7.

Wait, that seems right. So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it all together: The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value calculation. Alternatively, using the expectation value formula: ⟨A⟩ = ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so σ_x is a matrix:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

So let's compute ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

|alpha> is (1+i)|↑> + (2 -i)|↓> divided by sqrt(7).

So to compute this, let me write it in vector form. Let me denote |↑> as (1,0) and |↓> as (0,1). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, σ_x |alpha> is the matrix product:

[0 1; 1 0] multiplied by |alpha> gives [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by σ_x |alpha>.

So the inner product is:

( (1+i)^* / sqrt(7) )*( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 -i)^* / sqrt(7) )*( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

Which is [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i². Since i²=-1, this is 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1=1+3i.

Adding them together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2. So the inner product is 2/7. Then, ⟨σ_x⟩ is 2/7.

So ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Yes, that matches. So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7. So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron state |alpha⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|↑⟩ + (2-i)|↓⟩, where |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state is first normalized by dividing by the norm of the coefficients, which is √7. Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |↑\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |↓\rangle.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, specifically \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|↑\rangle + |↓\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|↑\rangle - |↓\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The eigenvalues of \( A \) are therefore \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates is computed. The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is given by \( |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \), and the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is given by \( |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 \).

1. **Overlap with \( |+x\rangle \):**
   \[
   \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
   \]

2. **Overlap with \( |-x\rangle \):**
   \[
   \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is found to be \( \frac{2}{7} \). Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
