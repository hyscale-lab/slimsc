Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I remember that IR helps identify functional groups. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests maybe an alcohol (O-H stretch) or possibly an alkyne. But wait, the 1720 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) group. That makes me think of either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 cm-1 peak could be aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 might be something else, maybe C-O stretching or another aromatic ring vibration.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Or wait, wait. Actually, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, I've also heard that sometimes aldehydes can be a bit upfield. Alternatively, could this be an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid? But a carboxylic acid proton is usually broader and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, that would fit with the IR's 1720 cm-1. Let me think: IR shows 1720 which is a strong peak, so maybe a carbonyl group. Aldehydes have a C=O around 1720, so that fits. So that 10.5 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton.

Wait, but another possibility is a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons attached, so the NMR wouldn't show a peak around 10 ppm. So aldehyde makes sense.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This seems like two aromatic protons as a doublet. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another two aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets suggest that on the benzene ring, there are two sets of two protons each, which are adjacent to substituents. So perhaps the substituent is at the para position. Wait, but if the substituent is at para, then the two protons on either side would each be a doublet.

Wait, in the case of para-substituted benzene with an aldehyde group, you would have a compound like benzaldehyde, but more substituted. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the substituent is an aldehyde at position 1, then the ring would have protons in positions 2 and 6 as a doublet each? Hmm,
