Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and g_i and g_j are the statistical weights of the energy levels.

In this case, the energy difference is E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_i is the excited state and E_j is the ground state. So E_i - E_j is positive. The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. I think that means the ratio n_i / n_j for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1 (or maybe 0.5? Wait, wait. Let me be precise.)

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So maybe n1_i / n1_j = 2, and n2_i / n2_j = 1? Or perhaps the other way around? Wait, let's clarify.

Let me denote for star_1: (n1_i / n1_j) = 2
For star_2: (n2_i / n2_j) = 1?

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So for example, for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = 2, and for star_2, it's n2_i / n2_j = 1. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, I
