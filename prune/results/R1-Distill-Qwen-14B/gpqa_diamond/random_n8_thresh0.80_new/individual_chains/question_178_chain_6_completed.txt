Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem gives the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that these σ terms are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or maybe something to do with the field strength tensor.

Wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Right, in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, it's superrenormalizable; if it's zero, renormalizable; and negative means nonrenormalizable.

So, first, I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me write down the Lagrangian again: L = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I should find the dimensions of each part. Let's break it down.

First, ψ is a spinor field. In 4D, each ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because the Dirac equation is (∂/i + m)ψ = 0. So the derivative has dimension 1, and ψ must have 3/2 to balance it. So ψ̄ would also have 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. The structure σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is antisymmetric. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives. So [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless, so σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

The F tensor is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential, which in 4D has dimension 1 (because the field tensor F has dimension 2: each derivative is 1, and F is made of derivatives of A). So A has dimension 1. Wait, F^{μν} is ∂A, so each term is derivative (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F has dimension 2.

But wait, let me double-check. The field strength F is made of ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each partial derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so each term in F is 1+1=2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2. So the whole term is 3 + 2 = 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So let me compute the dimension of the product (ψ̄ σ ψ F).

ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = (3/2 +3/2)=3; plus 2 gives 5. So the product term has dimension 5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

So the first part says [κ] is -1. So looking at the options, options A and C have that. Now, the second question is whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizability depends on whether the coupling's dimension is non-negative. Because in a renormalizable theory, the couplings have mass dimension ≤4 in 4D. Wait, in four dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is greater than or equal to zero. Because if the dimension is positive, it's superrenormalizable. If it's zero, renormalizable. Negative, nonrenormalizable.

Wait, wait. The general rule is that for a theory with coupling λ, if [λ]_M ≥ 0, it's renormalizable. If [λ]_M <0, it's nonrenormalizable.

In our case, [κ]_M is -1. So that's negative. That means the theory is not renormalizable, right? So the theory is nonrenormalizable.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because κ is negative, so not renormalizable.

Option C: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Yes.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian
In 4 spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Each term in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must therefore combine to give a total mass dimension of 4.

### Step 2: Mass dimensions of individual fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The Hermitian conjugate spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, and has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 3: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability of the theory
In 4 spacetime dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa]_M \geq 0$. If $[\kappa]_M < 0$, the theory is nonrenormalizable. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
