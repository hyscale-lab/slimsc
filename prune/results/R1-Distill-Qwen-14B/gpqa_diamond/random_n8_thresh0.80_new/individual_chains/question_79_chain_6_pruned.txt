Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra were taken. I'm supposed to figure out what compound X is from the given options.

Wait, first, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh, right, that's a compound called DBU (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). I remember DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe elimination or some kind of ring-opening.

So, what kind of reaction conditions are we talking about here? The solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K—that's about 130°C. The duration is a day, which suggests it's a reaction that might take a while but doesn't require extreme conditions beyond heating.

Now, the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

The 13C NMR data is:

- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm. Let me try to figure out what the product is first. Once I know the product, maybe I can backtrack to find the starting material.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the singlet at around 2 ppm could be a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal—maybe a carbonyl or an electronegative atom. Wait, but in the product, I see a singlet for 3H. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to a carbonyl? Or perhaps it's part of a ring.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the high value at 197.7 ppm is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, or perhaps an ester. But wait, the reaction involved DBU, which is a base. So maybe the reaction is deprotonating something, but in this case, the product has a carbonyl. Hmm, could it be an epoxide ring-opening?

Wait, wait, the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7. Another possibility: an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxides are ethers, but that's a higher carbon than usual. Wait, no, the carbonyl at 197.7 is more likely a ketone or perhaps an ester.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Because the starting material is an epoxide? Or perhaps, the reaction converts something into an epoxide. But wait, DBU is a base, and it's often used in elimination reactions, like forming epoxides from diols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used in acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, but that usually would require an acid, not a base.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and DBU is used for ring-opening. Wait, but epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions usually leads to alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't an epoxide but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

So, all options are oxiranes (epoxides) except perhaps none. Wait, no, oxirane is another name for epoxide. So all options are epoxides with substituents.

So, the starting material is an epoxide (oxirane), and the reaction is with DBU. Wait, but DBU is a base, which is often used in elimination reactions, but what reaction could an epoxide undergo with DBU?

Wait, perhaps the DBU is acting as a catalyst for an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Wait, but DBU is a base, not an acid. So maybe the reaction isn't ring-opening but something else, like an elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger structure that undergoes some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not about the ring-opening but something else. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility is that the epoxide is part of a cyclic ether, and DBU is used as a base to induce some kind of elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction converts it into a diene or something similar.

Wait
