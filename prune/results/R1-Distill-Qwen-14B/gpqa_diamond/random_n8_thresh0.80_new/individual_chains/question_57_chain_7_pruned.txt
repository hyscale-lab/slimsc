Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes are related to phase shifts in quantum mechanics. The question gives me some phase shifts δ₀ through δ₄, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering δ₀ to δ₄. The energy is 50 MeV, but I'm not sure how that plays in yet. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is given by some formula involving these phase shifts. 

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like f = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * P_l(cosθ), where l is the angular momentum quantum number, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, when we're looking along the incident beam direction, that's θ = 0 degrees. So cosθ is 1, meaning that only the l=0 term will survive because P_l(1) is zero for l>0. Because P₀(1) is 1, and P_l(1)=0 for l≥1.

So for θ=0, the only term that contributes is l=0. So the scattering amplitude simplifies a lot here. Let's think about that. 

The amplitude f(θ=0) is (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2iδ₀} - 1) * (2*0 + 1) * P_0(1). Since P_0(1)=1 and 2*0+1=1, so it's just (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2iδ₀} - 1). 

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need Im(f(0)). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute e^{2iδ₀}. Since δ₀ is given as 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So e^{2i π/2} = e^{iπ} = -1. So e^{2iδ₀} is -1.

So (e^{2iδ₀} - 1) = (-1 - 1) = -2. So the amplitude is (1/(2ik)) * (-2) = (1/(2ik)) * (-2) = (-1)/(ik).

But wait, the imaginary part is what we're after. So let me compute Im(f(0)). So f(0) = (-1)/(ik). Let's write k in terms of the momentum.

Wait, I need to find the value of k. k is the wave number, which relates to the energy. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. Hmm, but I think the formula for k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but I might have the units wrong. Wait, 50 MeV is the kinetic energy. Oh wait, for non-relativistic speeds, but electrons at 50 MeV are relativistic, so perhaps it's better to use the relativistic expression.

Alternatively, maybe the problem provides a way to compute k without getting into the weeds of the actual particle physics. Because the options are given in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 meters. 

Wait, I remember that for electron scattering, the wave number k can be approximated using the relation E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), but at high energies, perhaps a different approach is used. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that k is given by k = sqrt(8mE)/ħ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps for electrons, with E in MeV, there's a standard way to compute k.

Wait, but maybe I can look for a formula that relates the scattering amplitude to the given phase shifts. Oh, wait a moment, in the case when you're considering the forward direction (θ=0), the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2iδ₀} - 1).

Because, as I thought earlier, higher terms (l>0) vanish when θ=0.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = Im[(1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ₀} - 1)].

Let me compute that. Let's write e^{2iδ} as cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). So e^{2iδ} - 1 = (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ).

So substituting, (e^{2iδ} -1) = 2i sin(δ) e^{iδ} ? Wait, maybe that's a trigonometric identity I should use. Or perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part directly.

Let me compute (e^{2iδ} -1):

e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(
