Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the structure better. The formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which I don't think are present here. So substituting, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because DoU should be an integer. Did I make a mistake? Let me recalculate. Oh wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1 -0)/2. Because N is considered as +1, unlike halogens. Wait, no, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting, 2*8=16+2=18. 18-9=9. Then plus N (which is 1), so 10. Divided by 2 is 5. Oh, wait, that's better. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring, a double bond, and two other rings? Or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me try to interpret the NMR. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's quite upfield for a triplet, but maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets. But if it's a triplet, maybe it's adjacent to another proton, like a CH2 group.
