Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for ring-closing metathesis, right? But wait, let's think carefully.

So, racemic means the compound has both enantiomers in equal amounts. The compound in question is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3) maybe? Wait, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let's count the carbons correctly.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon. The third carbon is the one after the double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? Wait, no. Wait, if pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, then the third carbon is the CH₂ in the middle. So adding a methyl to the third carbon would make it CH₂=CHCH(CH3)2? Hmm, no, wait. Let me write it clearly.

Wait, pent means 5 carbons. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, the three middle carb
