Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why there's no green signal when they look at the mouse under the microscope. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the question describes a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. Not sure if that's super relevant, but maybe the structure affects how they interact.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector. So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor? Or is it in a way that the construct can produce both proteins?

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, so that's probably for driving expression of the ligand. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the expression of the second gene in a bicistronic vector. So the setup is: CBA promoter drives the ligand, then through IRES, the receptor is expressed.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Hmm, loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette. But the problem is about expression after using a Cre model.

They made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal. They look for green (eGFP) but don't see it. Why?

Options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression in the construct? If they're secreted, maybe, but the construct is for expression in the same cell? Not sure if this affects the Western blot or GFP expression.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If eGFP isn't expressed, maybe it's not trafficked correctly. But the Western blot tested expression after transfection. The eGFP would be expressed if the construct is working. But the question says they used the same antibodies as in the Western blot, so perhaps the expression is not happening. But why in the mouse?

Option C: enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the genes won't be expressed. The vectors have CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor, so maybe the CBA is sufficient. Unless the CBA isn't active in the cells they're looking at, but SOX10-Cre would target it to neural crest cells where the receptors are supposed to be active.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if the stop cassette isn't properly removed, the frame could be wrong. The ligand has a stop between it and mCherry in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. When Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes. But wait, the lox sites matter. LoxP and lox2272 are different; Cre can recognize both but in a certain order. The loxP is upstream of the ligand's stop, and lox2272 is downstream of the receptor's stop.

Wait, the setup is that the ligand is first, then the stop in loxP. The receptor is after IRES, then a stop in lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes. For the ligand, the stop is flanked by loxP. Cre would remove that stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is flanked by lox2272 (which is a variant of loxP), so Cre would remove that stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. 

But wait, the lox sites have to be in a specific order for Cre to excise them. If the vector has loxP on either side
