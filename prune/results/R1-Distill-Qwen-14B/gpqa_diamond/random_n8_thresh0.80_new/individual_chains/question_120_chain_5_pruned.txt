Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (p) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution in the sky... Oh, so that probably means their distances are spread out in a certain way. But wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Is it uniform in terms of number per unit volume? Or uniform in some other measure?

Wait, in space, the number density of stars might not be uniform, but maybe in this question's scenario, it's assumed that the stars are uniformly distributed, so their density is uniform. That would mean that the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume. But wait, how does that translate to parallax?

Parallax p is related to distance d by p = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). So as d increases, p decreases. So, if we're looking at stars with a certain range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, what's the number of stars in that range?

Wait, let's think about this. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So, N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per volume). But how does that relate to parallax?

Distance d is 1/p. So, when p changes by dp, the corresponding change in d would be how much? Let's see, if p increases by dp, then d decreases
