Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure out what that energy is. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by the total energy formula, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Oh right, the formula is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has an atomic number of 3, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. The mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion, which I think is a charged particle. But for the purpose of calculating the energy, I might just need the rest mass.

I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the rest mass would be the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus. But wait, is it per nucleon or the total? Since it's a nucleus, I should use the total mass. Oh, but wait, the mass of a nucleus can be found by the sum of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but maybe for this problem, they just want me to use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mass value. I think the standard approach is to use the mass of the nucleus in terms of atomic mass units (u), but then convert that into energy terms using Einstein's equation.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the molar mass. So for Li-6, each nucleus has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units. Wait, but wait, the exact value might matter. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li is about 6.94 g/mol for Li, but that's for the isotope Li-7. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as m = A * m_p, where m_p is the mass of a proton (but that's an approximation),
