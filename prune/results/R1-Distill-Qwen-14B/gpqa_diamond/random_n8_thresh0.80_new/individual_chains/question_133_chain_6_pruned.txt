Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, but I'm not sure how that affects things yet.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The options are A to D, all around 1e-7 M, so the concentration is pretty low. They also provided the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. I remember that these K values relate to the acidity of the different protons in phosphoric acid.

So, I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which should be the conjugate base of H3PO4, but wait, H3PO4 is triprotic. Let me think: H3PO4 can donate three protons. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. H3PO4 is the acid, and it loses H+ to form H2PO4^- (the first deprotonation). Then H2PO4^- can lose another H+ to become HPO4^2- (second deprotonation, which has a much smaller Ka2). The third dissociation is HPO4^2- losing another H+ to become PO4^3- (very small Ka3).

So, in the solution, we have KH2PO4, which is K+ and H2PO4^- (since K is the counterion). And Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water molecules, but I think they dissociate completely in solution). So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That sounds like a buffer solution because they are adjacent species in the dissociation series of H3PO4.

In a buffer solution, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, what's the pKa here? Since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 would be log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about 7.207. Let me check: pKa = -log(6.2e-8) → let's calculate that.

Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So the log of 6.2 is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.79 -8 = -7.21. So pKa is 7.21.

Wait, no, wait. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses the pKa of the acid in the pair. So here, H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate H+), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So yes, pKa is 7.21.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? Hmm. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Wait, no, orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- form, I think. Or maybe it's any of the phosphate ions.

Wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. Its dissociation forms H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is the orthophosphate?), and PO4^3- (the phosphate ion). Hmm, not quite sure about the terminology, but for this problem, I think we're being asked about the HPO4^2- concentration. Because the solution has KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So when they ask for orthophosphate, perhaps they mean HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Does that mean PO4^3-? Because sometimes PO4^3- is called the orthophosphate ion, while HPO4^2- is hydrogen orthophosphate. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the nomenclature.

Phosphoric acid is H3PO4. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). The second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, or orthophosphate?), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate ion). Wait, I think I might have heard that orthophosphate refers to PO4^3- before. So when people talk about orthophosphate ions, they mean PO4^3-.

Wait, but in this problem, we have HPO4^2- in the solution, which comes from Na2HPO4. So if the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-, then that's not present in significant amounts because we're dealing with HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would make a buffer solution. The PO4^3- would only be present if HPO4^2- dissociates further, but since the solution is at
