Okay, so I've got this problem about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering, right? I remember from my notes that the scattering amplitude is related to something called the optical theorem or maybe partial waves. 

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Oh right, the Born approximation or something more advanced? But this seems more specific. Oh wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident beam direction) has a particular formula.

I recall that for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part Im f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) times the sine of the phase shift δ_l. Or wait, no, maybe it's the sum of (2l +1) multiplied by sin δ_l. Because the optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total is 4π/ k² times Im f(0), where k is the wave number. But wait, in our case, we don't have σ_total, but we have the phase shifts δ_l. Oh, wait, the expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l+1) (sin δ_l) / (k l (l+1)) ) * ... something, but perhaps for θ=0, it's simplified.

Wait, maybe the formula is Im
