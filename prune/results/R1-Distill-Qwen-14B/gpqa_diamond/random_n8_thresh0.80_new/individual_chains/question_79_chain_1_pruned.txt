Okay, I have this problem about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Let me try to work through this step by step.

So, the compound X is C11H12O. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I think that's a ring-opening reaction, maybe an epoxide opening? Because 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used as a catalyst in such reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Another thought: when epoxides react under certain conditions, they can open. But wait, compound X is being reacted with DBU (which is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's an elimination reaction, or maybe a ring-opening. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide ring-opening via a different mechanism.

Wait, but the question is about figuring out the structure of compound X. So maybe we don't need to focus too much on the reaction itself. Let me look at the product's NMR data.

The product has the following 1H NMR signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR has:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

So, let's try to interpret these. Starting with the 1H NMR. The singlet at 2.28 ppm (3H) and another singlet at 2.31 ppm (3H) might be two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a ring. Since both are singlets, no neighboring protons.

Looking at the aromatic region: the multiplets. Let's see:

- 6.75 ppm (1H, d): This could be part of a substituted benzene ring, perhaps as a trans coupling. Similarly, 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, the doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene? Or perhaps a substituent on a benzene ring with coupling in a certain way.

Wait, let me think about the aromatic region. The 1H NMR shows a doublet at 6.75 (1H), another at 7.08 (2H), another at 7.68 (1H), and another at 7.71 (2H). Hmm, perhaps this indicates a structure with conjugated double bonds, like a styrene or similar.

The 13C NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm, which is a strong indication of a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, but that's a very high value for a ketone. Wait, typical ketones are around 200-220 ppm? Or maybe that's a carbonyl group in an epoxide? Wait, no. Wait, the epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm, I think. Wait, no, I'm confusing. Maybe the 197.7 is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an ester or a ket
