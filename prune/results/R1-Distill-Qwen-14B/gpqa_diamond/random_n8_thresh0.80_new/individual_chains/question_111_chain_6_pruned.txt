Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each.

First part: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The product is A.

Second part: 1-nitropropane reacts with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form B.

And the options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B products.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The structure seems a bit complex. Let me try to draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so the ring is numbered such that the ketone is at C1). Then, at C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, no, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, the substituents are at C2 and C6. So, at C2, there are two methyl groups and an ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone has the ketone at position 1. Then position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it two substituents?

Wait, no. The position 2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group? Or perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Hmm, perhaps the structure is that position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, no, because the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the substituents are at C2 (ethyl) and C6 (methyl), but wait, the 2 and 6 positions each have a methyl and an ethyl? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-
