Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst... I think Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. From what I remember, olefin metathesis is a reaction where the catalyst causes the redistribution of alkene fragments. It usually involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene complex, right? It's typically used for ring-closing metathesis, but I think it can also do ring-opening and cross metathesis.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure of that? Let's draw it out. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the formula would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃, but wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? Or maybe pentane has five carbons, so pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait. Let me count the carbons.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the main chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. The substituent is a methyl group on C3.

So, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait. Let me count the positions. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, the correct structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Pent has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

So Carbon 1 is double bonded to C2. Then, C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but that would make the molecule CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in total, right? Let me count: C1 (CH₂), C2 (CH-), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2?), C5 (CH3)? No, wait. Wait, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? But wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no, no, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So when you have 3-methyl, it's on the third carbon from the end. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another way: the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the formula C6H12? No, wait, wait. Wait no, wait. Let me not get stuck on that. The structure is correct as I thought: CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? No. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but I can't do that right now. Alternatively, I can think about the structure as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the branching wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH₂)₂CH-CH₂CH2? No, perhaps I should move on and see how that affects the problem.

Wait, but the problem says it's racemic, so it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a stereogenic center. So in 3-methylpent-1-ene, is there a stereogenic center?

Wait, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. No, that can't be right because that's six carbons. So I must have made a mistake. Let me try again.

Wait, pent-1-ene: five carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. Structure: CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, maybe I'm numbering wrong. Let me try this again.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name would have the double bond starting at the earliest possible position. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3 of the main chain. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. That can't be right because pent has five. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3, but that's six, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No,
