Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the problem, the provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct. The issue is that they can't overexpress the protein. So I need to look at the sequence and find out what's wrong.

Let me think about possible issues. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, so maybe there's a problem with that region.

Looking at the sequence, the initial part is the start codon, ATG. Then comes TAC. Wait, wait. The start codon is ATG. After that, TAC is the next codon. TAC is the DNA sequence; the mRNA would be AUG, which is tyrosine. So the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CC (Pro) from the next two bases. Wait, let me parse the sequence correctly.

Wait, DNA is read in triplets. Let me write it out: the sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Hmm.

Wait, wait. Wait, the first part is ATG (start), then TAC, which is the next codon. But wait, in the mRNA, the DNA is transcribed into mRNA as the complement. So the DNA sequence is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the complementary 3' to 5' but read 5' to 3'. So the mRNA starts with A (from T), then U (from A), G (from G), so AUG, which is methionine, the start.

The next codon is TAC on the DNA, which in mRNA would read AUA. Wait no, wait. DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is complementary and antiparallel. So the DNA strand is 5' ATG TAC CCA ... So the mRNA would be AUG AUC CUA ... Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA but with T replaced by U. So the mRNA would be A U G A U C C U ... So the first codon is Met, then the next is Tyr, then Pro, etc.

Wait, but the construct includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the first part of the protein should be the HA tag, then GADD45G.

But looking at the start of the coding sequence, after ATG (Met), the next codon is TAC (Tyr), which is part of the HA tag. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, like YPYDHHVY (but I'm not certain). But
