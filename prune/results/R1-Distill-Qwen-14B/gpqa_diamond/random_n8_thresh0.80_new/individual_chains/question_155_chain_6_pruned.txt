Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the operator P_z, which is denoted as ΔP_z. So I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩². Oh wait, right, because the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value, all under a square root.

The setup is that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So I don't need to change the basis or anything, I can work directly with the given state.

So first, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then plug into the uncertainty formula.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. Let me write down the components: the first element is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2. Let me confirm that the vector is properly normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating: | -1/2 |² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly for the third component. The middle component is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Yep, it's normalized. Good.

So the state |ψ> is a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state is a column vector, so the components are in the order ψ_1, ψ_2, ψ_3. So ψ = ψ_1 |e1> + ψ_2 |e2> + ψ_3 |e3>, where |e_i> are the basis vectors (eigenvectors of P_z).

Now, since the basis is that of P_z's eigenvectors, each |e_i> corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

Wait, that's the matrix. So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ for the first basis vector, 0 for the second, and -ħ for the third.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues when the operator is diagonal, right? So in the P_z basis, the eigenvalues are along the diagonal. So the first basis vector |e1> is an eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue ħ. The third |e3> has eigenvalue -ħ. The second one (the middle) is eigenvalue 0.

So the state ψ is a combination of these three basis vectors. The components are:

ψ = (-1/2)|e1> + (1/√2)|e2> + (-1/2)|e3>

So to compute the expectation value of P_z, <P_z>, it's the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue for each |e_i>, right?

Wait, no. Because when the state is expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates, like ψ = a|e1> + b|e2> + c|e3>, then the expectation value of P_z is |a|² * (eigenvalue of e1) + |b|² * (eigenvalue of e2) + |c|² * (eigenvalue of e3).

So let's compute |a|², |b|², |c|².

a = -1/2 → |a|² = 1/4.

b = 1/√2 → |b|² = 1/2.

c = -1/2 → |c|² = 1/4.

The eigenvalues for each basis state:

e1: ħ.

e2: 0.

e3: -ħ.

So, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0 → 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square of the operator will have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.

So P_z² has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value <P_z²> is |a|²*(ħ²) + |b|²*(0) + |c|²*(ħ²) = (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now
