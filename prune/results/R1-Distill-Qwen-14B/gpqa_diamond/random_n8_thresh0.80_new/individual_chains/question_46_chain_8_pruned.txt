Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And the task is to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis. Right, metathesis is a reaction where the positions of substituents in alkenes are exchanged. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, usually for ring-closing or cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers, right? So the molecule has a chiral center. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but wait, it's 3-methyl. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's number from the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons after the double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's 1-pentene with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2; the third carbon (assuming that's the one after the double bond) has a methyl group.

Wait, but wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon from the left (the first carbon is the double bond) would have a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=
