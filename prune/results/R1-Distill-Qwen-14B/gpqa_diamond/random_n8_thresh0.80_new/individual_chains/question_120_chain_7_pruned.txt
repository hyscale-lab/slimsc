Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their actual density is uniform in space, right? So, they're spread out evenly. But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. 

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. Oh wait, no, actually, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so higher plx means closer. But that might not be directly relevant here.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So for a given range of plx, how many stars are there. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is constant. But when we look at them from Earth, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because of the geometry of the situation.

Let me think about how distance relates to parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if a star is at distance d (parsecs), its plx is 1/d. 

Now, if I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d, the volume of that shell would be the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by a small thickness (dd). The number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density (since density is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec). So, number of stars N in shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax is plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the expression for N. So, d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance, which can be expressed in terms of plx. Let's see, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me take it step by step.

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases by a small amount δplx, the corresponding change in d is δd = - (1/plx²) δplx. Since δd is negative (because as plx increases, distance decreases), but when we take the absolute value, it's positive. So, the thickness in distance dd is (1/plx²) δplx. 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars per unit plx. So, the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + δplx would be the integral over that plx range. Alternatively, let me think in terms of transformation of variables.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² * dd. Now, express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then δd = - (1/d²) δplx → δd = - plx² δplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So, the thickness in distance is related to the thickness in plx by dd = - (1/plx²) δplx. But since δd is negative when
