Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting (like triplet or quartet) is due to neighboring protons. Also, the chemical shifts can give clues about the structure.

So for Compound A, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are probably on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Because a triplet would mean they have two neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait. A triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. For example, if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton in the first CH2 would split into a triplet. Because each H in the first group has two neighboring H's in the adjacent CH2.

And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each H is next to a CH with three H's. Because quartet arises from coupling with three neighboring H's. So 4H as a quartet could be, perhaps, a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 group. Wait, but 4H... Hmm, maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2, but wait, no. Wait, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's a CH2 between two CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about the integrals. 6H and 4H. So the molecule has 10 protons in total? Or maybe not, but the two signals account for all the H in the molecule. Let's see. So 6H +4H =10H. So the molecule has 10 H's.

Wait, or perhaps it's a di-substituted structure. Maybe it's a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. Let's think: diethyl ether is CH2CH2OCH2CH3. The O would split the H's, but wait, diethyl ether's NMR usually shows a triplet around 1.2 ppm and a quartet around 3.5 ppm. Hmm, but in this case, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm and a triplet at 0.9. So maybe not diethyl ether.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Wait, cyclohexane itself would have a singlet, but if it's a di-substituted cyclohexane with two ethyl groups, perhaps. Wait, but how would the NMR look for that?

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is often indicative of a methyl group. Because methyl protons are usually around 0.9 ppm. So a triplet suggests that the methyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because each methyl H is next to two H's in the adjacent CH2.

So, considering that, if you have two methyl groups each as CH2CH3 attached to something. Let's see, maybe a cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached. So, cyclohexane with two ethyl substituents.

Wait, but how would that give the NMR signals? Let's think: each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The CH2 in the ethyl group adjacent to the cyclohexane would have two neighboring H's from the cyclohexane, but wait, the cyclohexane ring's H's would be different. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 2,5-dimethylcyclohexane. But wait, that would have two methyl groups on the cyclohexane. Then the protons on the adjacent carbons would split into triplets? Or perhaps the NMR would show different signals.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else. Like, perhaps a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups. So, maybe it's something like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that's not possible because
