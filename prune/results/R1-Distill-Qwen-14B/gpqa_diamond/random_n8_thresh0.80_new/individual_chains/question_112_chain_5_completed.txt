Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I should probably normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it hasn't been normalized yet.

Wait, right. When a state is given as proportional, we need to find the normalization factor so that the total probability is 1. So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we need to divide by a normalization factor N. So, N squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Calculating N: The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, the magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So, N squared is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So N is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, the matrix is 2x2 since it's for spin-1/2 particles. So the matrix would be:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

That's because when i≠j, the element is ħ/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So this operator is the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is (ħ/2) * X.

Wait, the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, right? Because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the task is to find the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in |+x> and |-x>, and then find the average value (expectation value) of the operator.

Wait, let me structure this. To find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator. Alternatively, I can compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate and square the magnitude.

Alternatively, I can calculate the expectation value. Hmm, but let me first focus on finding the probabilities.

So, the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I mentioned. So let me write them down:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these states, then take the square of the magnitude to get the probabilities.

Wait, but |alpha> is already written in terms of |up> and |down>, so perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion coefficients in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Wait, another approach: any 2-level system can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of any operator. So perhaps I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

So let's compute c_+ and c_- such that |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

Express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can set up equations. Let me denote:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

So,

(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> = a (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2).

Let me group the |up> and |down> terms:

Coefficient of |up> on the RHS: [a + b]/sqrt(2)
Coefficient of |down> on the RHS: [a - b]/sqrt(2)

So, equating to the LHS:

1+i = (a + b)/sqrt(2)
2 -i = (a - b)/sqrt(2)

So we have a system of two equations:

Equation 1: a + b = sqrt(2) (1 + i)
Equation 2: a - b = sqrt(2) (2 - i)

We can solve this system for a and b.

Adding equations 1 and 2: 2a = sqrt(2) (1+i + 2 -i ) = sqrt(2) (3) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/2

Wait, wait, let me compute the sum inside.

1 + i +2 -i = 3. So sqrt(2)*3.

So 2a = 3 sqrt(2) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/2.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2b = sqrt(2) (1+i - (2 -i)) = sqrt(2) [1 +i -2 +i ] = sqrt(2) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So 2b = sqrt(2) (-1 + 2i) → b = [ sqrt(2) (-1 + 2i) ] / 2.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the subtraction: equation 1 minus equation 2.

Equation 1: a + b = sqrt(2)(1+i)
Equation 2: a - b = sqrt(2)(2 -i)
Subtract equation 2 from equation 1: 2b = sqrt(2) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ].

Compute inside the brackets: 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So 2b = sqrt(2) (-1 + 2i) → b = [ sqrt(2) (-1 + 2i) ] / 2.

So, now, a and b are known. The coefficients c_+ and c_- are a and b, respectively.

Wait, no: wait, in the expansion |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>, so the coefficients are a and b. So the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Wait, but wait, |alpha> is already normalized. Because we divided by sqrt(7) earlier. So |a|^2 + |b|^2 should be 1.

Let me compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute a: (3 sqrt(2))/2 → |a|^2 = ( (3 sqrt(2))/2 )^2 = (9 * 2) / 4 = 18/4 = 9/2 =4.5.

Wait, that can't be right because 4.5 + |b|^2 would be way larger than 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving for a and b.

Wait, let me re-examine the equations.

From equation 1: a + b = sqrt(2)(1 +i)
From equation 2: a - b = sqrt(2)(2 -i)

Adding them: 2a = sqrt(2) (3) → a = 3 sqrt(2)/2.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2b = sqrt(2) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ].

Which is sqrt(2) ( -1 + 2i ), as before.

But wait, if |alpha> is normalized, then |a|^2 + |b|^2 must be 1. But the a I have is 3 sqrt(2)/2, which gives |a|^2 = (9 *2)/4 = 9/2 =4.5. That's way bigger than 1, which can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the process.

Wait, I think I messed up the setup. Let me start over.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7). So when I expand |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis, I should write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

But let's write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down> as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So, substituting into the expansion:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down> )/(sqrt(2)) + c_- (|up> - |down> )/(sqrt(2))

We can factor out 1/sqrt(2):

|alpha> = [ (c_+ + c_- ) |up> + (c_+ - c_- ) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

But |alpha> is also equal to [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, equating the coefficients:

For |up>:
( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7 )

For |down>:
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7 )

So, we have:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )
Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Hmm, let me compute sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7, but maybe it's easier to keep as sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So, adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i )=3 +0i →3.

So, 2 c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Thus, c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7 )) ) = (3 sqrt(2/7)) / 2.

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7, but perhaps I'll just leave it as is.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Compute numerator: 1 -2 + i +i = -1 +2i.

So 2 c_- = (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

So,

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Now, compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

So, |c_+|^2 = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) = 18/(28) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |c_-|^2:

c_- = [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / ( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Compute numerator inside: (1 +4) =5. (sqrt(2))^2=2. So 5*2=10.

Denominator: (4 *7 )=28.

So |c_-|^2 = 10/28 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's very close to what I have. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match.

So the probabilities are about 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357.

Now, the average (expectation) value of the operator.

The operator is represented by matrix A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

So the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of X.

The expectation value of X in the state |alpha> is given by <alpha| X |alpha>.

Alternatively, since X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, the operator is (ħ/2) X, so the expectation value is (ħ/2) * <X>.

But <X> is the expectation in the state |alpha>, which is 2 * (probability of |+x> ) -1.

Wait, let me think. The expectation value of X when in state |+x> is +1, and in |-x> it's -1. So <X> = (|c_+|^2 * 1) + (|c_-|^2 * (-1)) ).

Which is |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2.

Wait, let me compute that.

|c_+|^2 is 9/14, |c_-|^2 is5/14.

So <X> = (9/14) - (5/14) )=4/14=2/7.

So the expectation value of the operator is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: average is ħ/7.

Option B: 3ħ/sqrt(7) → which is higher.

Option C: ħ/sqrt(7) → about 0.37 ħ.

Option D: 2ħ/sqrt(7) → about 0.755 ħ.

Wait, the calculation says average is ħ/7. So option A's average is correct.

So looking at option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average ħ/7.

But wait, the probabilities I calculated were 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571. 9/14 is exactly 0.642857, and 5/14 is 0.357142.

Looking at option A: 0.64 and 0.36. So that's approximately what I have. So the closest match is option A.

Wait, but let's check option C: 0.28, 0.72. That's the reverse. And option D has 0.61 and 0.29. So A is the one with probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which match 9/14 and 5/14 approximately.

Wait, 9/14 is 0.642857..., and 5/14 is 0.357142.... So option A's list is 0.64 and 0.36, which is accurate to two decimal places. So that's correct.

So the answer would be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value. The operator is A, which is (ħ/2) X. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * <X>. 

But <X> is c_+^2 - c_-^2? Wait, no, wait: when a state is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value of X is |+x> coefficient squared times 1 plus |-x> coefficient squared times (-1). So yes, it's |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2.

Which is (9/14) - (5/14) )=4/14=2/7.

So <X> is 2/7. So the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7 )= ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7. So option A's average is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: probabilities approximately 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor \( N \) is determined by the magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitudes are \( |1+i| = \sqrt{2} \) and \( |2-i| = \sqrt{5} \). Thus, \( N^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{5})^2 = 2 + 5 = 7 \), so \( N = \sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} X \), where \( X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The eigenstates of \( X \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the system in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into the expansion:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]

we solve for \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) by equating coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). This leads to the system of equations:

\[
c_+ + c_- = \sqrt{2}(1+i)/\sqrt{7}, \quad c_+ - c_- = \sqrt{2}(2-i)/\sqrt{7}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations gives:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) (for \( |+x\rangle \)) and \( 0.36 \) (for \( |-x\rangle \)).

Finally, the expectation value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | X | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( X \) is:

\[
\langle X \rangle = |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Combining the results, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.
