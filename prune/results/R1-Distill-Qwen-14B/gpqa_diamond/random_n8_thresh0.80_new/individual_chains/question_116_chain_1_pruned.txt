Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A. Let me break it down.

Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three.

Wait, so for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, 6H. That's a lot of hydrogens. 0.9 ppm is usually around methyl groups adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen or another CH2 group. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be a CH2 group next to another CH2. Let me think about structures with these signals.

If it's a triplet for 6H, that suggests maybe two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would have two neighboring Hs, but wait, no, each H in a CH3 would be next to two Hs in the same group. Wait, but in NMR, each peak reflects the environment of the protons. So, a triplet for 6H would likely be two separate sets of CH3 groups, each split by adjacent groups. Or perhaps a single CH2CH3 group, but that would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the two signals probably indicate that the molecule has a symmetrical structure. For example, perhaps a diethyl group or something similar. Let's see, diethyl ether? No, but diethyl ether has a central oxygen, but the NMR would show different shifts. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative with substituents.

Wait, considering the 6H and 4H. 6H as a triplet might be two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. So like CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH3 would be next to a CH2, which has two other Hs. Wait, but a CH2CH3 group would have the CH2 as a quartet and the CH3 as a triplet. Because each CH
