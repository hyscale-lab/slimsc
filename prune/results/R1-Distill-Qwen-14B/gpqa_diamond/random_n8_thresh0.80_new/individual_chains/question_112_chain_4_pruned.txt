Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. Since |alpha> is proportional to this, I guess I need to normalize it because the coefficients might not be normalized yet.

So first, I think I should find the normalization constant. The state is given as proportional, which means I have to compute the normalization factor. The state can be written as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> to find the normalization factor.

The inner product would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), wait no, wait. Wait, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so its conjugate transpose would be (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is α = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i), b=(2-i). So the inner product <α|α> is |a|^2 + |b|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. And |b|^2 is (2 -i)(2+i) = 4 +1 =5. So the total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

But wait, the question says |alpha> is proportional to that, so perhaps the actual state is that, but I might need to normalize it for probabilities.

Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state that |alpha> is normalized. So I think the first step is to normalize it. So, the state vector before normalization is (1+i, 2-i), since the components are in the |up> and |down> basis. The norm is sqrt( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ). As I calculated before, that's sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what does that look like? Let me think.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix. The diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

So A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], right? Because both off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So that's the matrix form.

Wait, no: A_ij is zero when i=j, else ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

So the operator A can be written as (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Because |up><down| is the matrix [[0,1],[0,0]], and |down><up| is [[0,0],[1,0]], so adding them gives [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A equals (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). 

Wait, but that's the standard form for the Pauli X matrix multiplied by (ħ/2). Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Right
