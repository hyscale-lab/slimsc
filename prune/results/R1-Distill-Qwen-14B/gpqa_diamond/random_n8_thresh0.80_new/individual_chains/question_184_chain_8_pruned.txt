Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, so I need to figure out which sequence correctly builds the desired molecule.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, that's meta, para, and ortho positions? No, wait, let's think again. If position 1 is ethoxy, then positions 2 and 3 are adjacent to it. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the ring looks like this: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are all adjacent in a row.

Now, the order of adding substituents matters because the directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent attaches. Benzene is initially un-substituted, so the first substitution will determine the orientation.

Let me think about the substituent effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky, but it's an activating, ortho/para director as well because it's an alkyl group. Wait, no, tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, but it's still an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order is crucial because each new group is added considering the directing effects of the existing groups.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about their directing effects. The nitro group is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is also activating, ortho/para, but bulky.

Hmm, but the nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group, which complicates things. So if I add the nitro group early, it would make the ring less reactive and affect where other groups are added.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro group is in position 3, the ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in position 2. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are all adjacent.

Wait, let's imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, and 3 form a row, with 1 being ethoxy, 2 tert-butyl, and 3 nitro. So the nitro is in the meta position relative to ethoxy, but the tert-butyl is in the ortho position relative to ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of the substituents in the order they are added and how each directs the next.

I think the first substituent is eth
