Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to get product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. Finally, we're looking at the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3 and trying to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.

Alright, starting with the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule with two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) probably leads to an elimination reaction. Since KOH can act as a base, especially in such conditions, it likely induces an E2 mechanism. Each Br is on a different carbon, so when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, it would cause the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. So, product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene, which would be an alkene.

Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so when two adjacent Brs are removed, the structure becomes more strained? I'm not too sure about the structure, but elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around the carbonyl region. Hmm, but if product 1 is an alkene, why the carbonyl peak? That's confusing. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, KOH is used as a base, but in some cases, it can lead to elimination to form alkenes. Alternatively, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond between the two carbons where the bromines were. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is an alkene, but why the IR peak at 1720? That's more like a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe I was wrong about the first step.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But with two leaving groups, perhaps it's a double elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe the structure is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution, but that seems less likely because KOH is a strong base.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, could the product be an epoxide? No, because epoxides are formed from dihalides, but more likely with a different setup. Hmm, perhaps the first step is a double elimination, leading to an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene. Then, looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an epoxide? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group with neighboring hydrogens. Wait, but product 1 is formed with KOH; that's a base. So maybe it's a diol? Wait, KOH in such conditions would not typically lead to diol formation unless it's a SN2 mechanism, but with two bromines, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution. But since KOH is a strong base, elimination is more likely. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. So product 1 is a diene, 1,3-adamantadiene. So the structure would have an alkene between carbons 1 and 3. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an alkene but a ketone? How? Oh, wait! If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a quaternary carbon (as in adamantane), elimination would form a double bond. But maybe there's another possibility. Oh, wait! What if the KOH reacts to form a geminal diol? No, because KOH is a strong base and more likely to eliminate.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diketone. Wait, how would that happen? Oh, wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let me think about other possibilities. Another reaction involving dibromides is the formation of epoxides, but that usually requires peracids or other oxidizing agents.

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but an epoxide. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide when treated with a base? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that would require substitution. But in that case, the NMR would show more hydrogens. Let me look at the NMR data given for product 1.

The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The integration is 2, 10, 2. So, the structure likely has a CH2 group at 4.79 ppm, which is upfield for CH2. Maybe an epoxide? Because epoxide rings have protons that resonate around 3-4 ppm. Hmm, but 4.79 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether group or adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, if the product is a diol, the protons on the -CH2-O- would show up around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which matches. So maybe product 1 is a diol, like 1,3-adamantanediol. But then why would KOH cause substitution here? KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution. Unless the structure is such that substitution is feasible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a conjugate addition. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the IR spectrum as well. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So product 1 has a carbonyl. That would suggest that it's a ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Wait, another possibility: The base (KOH) could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a carbonyl group via elimination of HBr twice. That would form a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a ketone. Wait, but where would the carbonyl be? If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, removing both would form a double bond. But for a carbonyl, perhaps they're on the same carbon? No, because it's 1,3-dibromo, meaning they're on different carbons. Maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated system that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Wait, but that's more about carbocation shifts. Alternatively, maybe the base induces elimination to form an alkene, and then another reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which upon heating with KOH does something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should move on and think about the subsequent steps, then backtrack.

Product 1 is then heated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, particularly in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something similar. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it's forming some type of cyclic ether or ester.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an enol ether, heating with Al isopropoxide might cause some rearrangement. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some addition or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 has a carbonyl group, then heating with Al isopropoxide might induce a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a cycloaddition occurs, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an alkene. But then, why would the initial step give a diol if KOH is a base? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial NMR. Product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group in a symmetrical environment. The 2.41-2.23 region integrates to 10H; that's a lot of protons. Adamantane has a lot of substituents, so perhaps these are all the equivalent hydrogens in the adamantane structure. Then, the 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group somewhere else.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet, so it's a group with two equivalent Hs and no neighboring Hs, or perhaps in a very symmetrical position. If product 1 is a diol, maybe the CH2 is connected to two oxygen atoms, like O-CH2-O. But that would be an ether, but the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a ketone's adjacent CH2 group. Wait, but ketones don't have adjacent Hs. Unless it's an enol, but enols are more acidic and would tautomerize to ketones.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketal or acetal. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the next step. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically cleaves the double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

But what's the structure of product 2? If product 1 is a diketone, then product 2 might be something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide is added. Ozonolysis followed by workup with a reductive agent (like dimethylsulfide) typically leads to the formation of aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure of the diene.

So product 3 would be the ozonolysis products. The NMR of product 3 is the target.

But let's go back. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Product 1: Maybe elimination to form 1,3-adamantadiene (a diene), but then the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr, each from adjacent carbons, forming a ketone on each? No, that's not possible because each Br is on a different carbon. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a base, forming a double bond and a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to a CH2 group. Upon elimination, each Br would form a double bond, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated dienyne or something else. I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should skip ahead and think about the ozonolysis part.

Assuming product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two or more carbonyl groups.

But wait, the ozonolysis of a cyclic diene would give different products. For example, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3. The most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative atoms, like carbonyls.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH group next to a ketone.

Now, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. Let's say this CH group is adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, the proton would couple with two protons from the CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but let's think more carefully. If the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the protons adjacent to the aldehyde would be CH2 groups. But in ozonolysis, perhaps each end becomes a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a diene, like 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But product 2 is derived from product 1, which was from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a more complex diene, such as a bicyclic or tricyclic diene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl compounds with specific structures.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl) via KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 via heating with Al isopropoxide.

3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

Assuming product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, product 2 could be a diene formed by some kind of elimination. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would yield product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

But I'm not getting the exact structures, so perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (not counting those that exchange with solvent). The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded would be near a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each proton would have coupling with two on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps one on another group.

Wait, if the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups. But in that case, the protons on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring group. Each CH2 would be next to another CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group next to a carbonyl and a CH2 group. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-R. Then, the middle CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe product 3 has a structure like (CH2)n with each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's think about the number of neighboring protons.

Suppose the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diketone, like O=C-R-CO. Where R contains CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 is a diketone with a chain in between, such as O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

In that case, the CH2 groups in the middle would be next to each other, so each CH2 would have two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each CH2 is also next to another CH2 group beyond that, leading to more splitting. Let me think: the first CH2 (next to CO) has two protons. Each of these protons is next to the adjacent CH2 group, which has two protons. So each proton on the first CH2 is split into a triplet by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. Additionally, if the adjacent CH2 is next to a third CH2, would that cause further splitting?

Hmm, but in this case, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So each CH2 is next to another CH2, but the end CH2s are only next to one CH2. So the central CH2 (if any) would be next to two CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but in this structure, each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2. So the first CH2 (next to CO) would have two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH2. So each proton on that CH2 would be a triplet.

But the most deshielded proton would be the one next to the carbonyl, which is part of the CH2 group. So each of those protons would couple with the two on the adjacent CH2, making a triplet. But wait, the adjacent CH2 has two protons, so each proton on the first CH2 is a triplet.

So the splitting would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, perhaps there's another coupling. If the CH2 is also adjacent to another group with protons, like a branching, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to each proton coupling with two protons from one side and one proton from another, making a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The CH2 groups are each adjacent to another CH2. So the protons on the first CH2 are each adjacent to two protons on the middle CH2. That would lead to each of them being a triplet.

But wait, if the middle CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each of the middle CH2 protons would be coupled to two on each side (four protons total?), but that's not possible because each proton can only couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, no. Each proton on CH2 A can only couple with protons on adjacent CH2 groups. So for the first CH2 (next to CO), their adjacent CH2 (B) has two protons. Each proton in A is split by two (from B), giving a triplet. The same applies to B: each proton in B is split by two from A and two from C (if any), but in this case, C would be the other end.

Wait, no. If it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 (B) is between A and C. So each proton in B would couple with two protons from A and two from C. But each coupling is J, so the splitting would be a triplet from each side, but because J values are the same (assuming symmetry), it would result in a triplet of triplets, leading to a quintet? Or perhaps a triplet with more splitting.

Wait, no. Each proton in B is adjacent to two protons on A and two on C. But each coupling is to two protons, each from a different set. So each proton in B is coupled to two J1 and two J2. If J1 and J2 are similar, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but in reality, it's a pentet (n+1, where n=4; but that's not an option). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, if each CH2 group is only adjacent to another CH2 on one side, then each CH2 would be a triplet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If product 1 is a diketone, then product 2 could be the product of a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's more about aromatic rings. Alternatively, product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether or something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a dienol ether. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into carbonyls.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. Therefore, the first reaction must form a carbonyl.

So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl). How?

Ah! Maybe the base KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to two eliminations. So each Br is eliminated, each time forming a double bond, but perhaps leading to a conjugated diene. Wait, but how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated with an adjacent H, forming a double bond, but then another elimination occurs. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to an allene (two double bonds), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with a strong base like KOH, two dehydrohalogenation steps occur, each eliminating HBr and forming a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, a conjugated diene. Then, the IR should show C=C peaks, but the given IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution. If two eliminations don't form a carbonyl, perhaps the product is a ketone. So maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require a different mechanism.

Another possibility: The base is causing a conjugate addition. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and each elimination forms a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to another, leading to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would work structurally.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, like 1,3-diketone adamantane. That would explain the IR peak. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

Then, product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide. What would that do? Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but perhaps in this case, it's used for dehydration or rearrangement.

If product 1 is a diketone, maybe the Lewis acid induces a cyclization. For example, the diketone could undergo an aldol condensation to form a conjugated enone system. So product 2 would be a cyclic enone or a different structure with a double bond adjacent to a ketone.

Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis of an enone (a conjugated dienone) would break the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated dienone would give two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

In that case, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded. Each CH2 would have two neighboring protons on either side. For example, the CH2 next to the ketone would have two protons, each coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So each proton on the first CH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2's two protons. Similarly, the adjacent CH2's protons would also be triplets. So the coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (adjacent to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

But wait, maybe the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 and perhaps another group with protons. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups. Each proton on the middle CH2 would couple with two from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets, which would be a septet? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, no. Each proton in the middle CH2 would have two neighboring protons on the left and two on the right. So each proton would couple with two different sets of two protons each. The splitting would be (n+1) for each coupling. So for two couplings, each with n=2, it would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 has only one adjacent CH2. So each CH2's protons would be split into a triplet. That matches option A.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each end CH2 is adjacent to only one CH2, so each end proton would be a triplet. The middle CH2 (if any) would be between two CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting. But in this case, the structure has two CH2 groups between the two carbonyls, making a four-carbon chain: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Then each middle CH2's protons would couple with two on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the total number of CH2 groups is two between the carbonyls. So O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the protons on the first CH2 (next to the ketone) would each couple with two protons on the next CH2. That would give a triplet. The middle CH2's protons would also couple with two on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets (each proton is split by two on the left and two on the right, but if the J values are similar, this would result in a quintet? Or perhaps a triplet of triplets).

Wait, but in reality, if a proton is split by two different sets of two protons, the splitting would be a triplet from each coupling, resulting in a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, option C is doublet of triplets.

So if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2's protons would couple with the adjacent CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet. But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, with three CH2 groups, then the middle CH2's protons would couple with two on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But the initial product 1 has a 1.94 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH2 group somewhere. Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So perhaps product 1 is a diketone with specific substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone adamantane, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl, and its coupling pattern would likely be a triplet if adjacent to a single CH2 group, or a triplet of triplets if adjacent to two CH2 groups.

But in the ozonolysis product, the structure would have carbonyl groups at both ends, with a chain in between. So if the chain is two carbons, the middle would have a CH2 adjacent to two others, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the CH2 groups would each have two protons, each adjacent to another CH2. So each CH2's protons would be a triplet.

But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2's protons would be a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of ozonolysis of a diene, the product would have carbonyl groups at the ends, and the chain between would depend on the diene's structure.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me just pick the most likely option.

The most deshielded proton is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2 group. So each of these protons would see two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that two molecules of HBr are eliminated, forming a diketone, specifically 1,3-adamantanedicarbaldehyde or a similar diketone structure. The NMR data for product 1 supports this interpretation, with a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to carbonyl groups.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**: Heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces a rearrangement or further reaction. Given the carbonyl groups in product 1, product 2 could be a conjugated enone or a diene formed via aldol condensation or similar mechanisms.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by addition of dimethylsulfide cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products (product 3). If product 2 is a diene or enone, ozonolysis would break the double bond(s) to yield aldehydes or ketones.

4. **NMR of product 3**: The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton would couple with neighboring protons. If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH₂ group, the proton would experience splitting due to the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **A) Triplet**: This corresponds to a proton coupled to two equivalent protons on an adjacent CH₂ group. This is consistent with the structure of product 3, where the most deshielded proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would occur if the proton is coupled to two sets of two protons (e.g., adjacent to two CH₂ groups). This is less likely based on the structure inferred from the reactions.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the proton is coupled to one proton and two equivalent protons. This is inconsistent with the expected structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the proton is coupled to four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton in product 3 is a triplet, as it is adjacent to a single CH₂ group. 

**Answer: A**
