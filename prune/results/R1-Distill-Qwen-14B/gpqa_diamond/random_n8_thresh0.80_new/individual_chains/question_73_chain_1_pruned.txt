Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with relativity, I remember that velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, wait! The question is about the relative speed between them. So, I guess I have to find the speed of one from the perspective of the other.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed wouldn't just be the difference of their speeds, right? Because in relativity, it's not that straightforward. So I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, wait, wait. Let me get that right. Oh no, wait, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, doesn't that depend on the frame? Wait, no, I think when you're in one frame and you want to find the speed of another object as seen from your frame, you use that formula.

Wait, but in this case, each astronaut is moving relative to the other. So I'm not sure if I should calculate the speed of the
