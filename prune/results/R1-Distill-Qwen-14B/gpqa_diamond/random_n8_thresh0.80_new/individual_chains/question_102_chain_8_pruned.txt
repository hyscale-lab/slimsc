Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and what's going wrong with the expression. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, IRES allows internal ribosome entry sites, so it can drive translation of the downstream gene without the need for a separate promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the ligand, then the IRES would drive the receptor.

Wait, looking at the vector structure: The ligand's ORF is first, then a stop cassette with loxP, then mCherry. The receptor is after that, with a stop cassette using lox2272, and then eGFP. So when the vector is transfected into cells, the CBA promoter should drive the expression of ligand and mCherry, but only if the stop is removed with Cre. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But the problem is that they've transfected this into primary astrocyte culture. The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and then they did a Western blot. Actin loading is proportional, so the blot is working. So the question is why, after using SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal (eGFP) under the confocal.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would presumably express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, right? So the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes perhaps.

Wait, but the construct has loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette with loxP. Then the receptor has a stop with lox2272. So when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, it would delete the stop cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, maybe another system is used. Wait, no, the lox2272 is a different recombinase target, not Cre. Oh wait, no, wait. The lox2272 is a variant of loxP; I think Cre can still recognize it but maybe it's a tight site or something. Wait, but in this case, maybe the Cre is only removing the loxP stop, and the receptor's stop is another lox site. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that only the ligand's stop is under Cre, and the receptor's stop is under a different system. Or perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with two stop cassettes. The ligand is under CBA, which should drive it, but with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after the ligand's ORF. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Wait, wait, no. The ligand ORF is at 5', followed by stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But the CBA promoter would drive the ligand. So the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF. So the IRES would drive the receptor and the eGFP, but the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So unless that stop is removed, eGFP isn
