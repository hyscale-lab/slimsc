Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have carbonyl groups, so the IR would have a peak around 1700 cm^-1. That makes sense.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the possible substitution patterns are para, meta, or ortho. Wait, but the number of signals can tell us. If it's para, there would be two sets of aromatic protons: the two H in the para positions would be equivalent, but wait, no, wait a di-substituted benzene in the para position would have two sets. Let me think: para substitution would give two equivalent Hs on each adjacent carbon, so maybe two doublets or something. Alternatively, if it's ortho substitution, the aromatic protons may split into more signals. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe I'll come back to this.

- Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets when adjacent to another proton. So maybe these are from an ethylene group attached to something else, like an ester.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups? Or same? If they're same, why two signals? Hmm, perhaps the two –CH3 groups are in different environments. For example, maybe one is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and another is adjacent to something else.

No signals for –CH2, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups. So all the CH2 groups are either absent or maybe part of the aromatic ring, but benzene doesn't have CH2 in the ring.

So putting this together, the compound likely has an ester group, which is O-CO-O something. Wait, no, ester is RCOOR'. So the structure would have a carbonyl attached to an oxygen, which is connected to another R group.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene could have an ester substituent and another group. Let me think about possible structures. One substituent could be a methyl group, but wait, the NMR has two methyl signals. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else with a methyl.

Wait, another possibility: the di-substituted benzene has two ester groups. No, but the IR shows an ester, not multiple. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. Let me imagine a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps, or another group with CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. That suggests two different methyl groups. So maybe one methyl is attached to
