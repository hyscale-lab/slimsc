Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a certain type of nucleus to a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, the question says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the atomic number is 3 (protons) plus 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. Oh wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass number A is 6, so the mass will be based on that. Got it.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So it's asking for the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at that speed.

I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because when v is a significant fraction of c, we need to use special relativity.

So first, let's calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c squared. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the next part is figuring out the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest energy is m0 c². So I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, Li-6 is a light nucleus, so maybe I can approximate its mass using the atomic mass unit (u).

The atomic mass unit is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus would be the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus any binding energy, but wait, actually, the exact mass might be better found from the periodic table. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a single nucleon, since it's a heavy ion. Wait, sometimes in these problems, when the nucleus is moving at high speeds, they treat it as a collection of nucleons, but maybe I should just consider the nucleus as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus, which is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Wait, but binding energy is significant even in light nuclei, so maybe I should use the exact mass of Li-6 from the table.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's for the isotope Li-7. Wait no, Li has isotopes, Li-6 and Li-7. The natural abundance is about 75% Li-7 and 25% Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 u. Let me confirm: I recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units. So the mass m0 would be 6.017 u.

So m0 c
