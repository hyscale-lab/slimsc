Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And there are matrices provided for P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector is expressed in a particular basis, and here the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the components of the state vector are the coefficients in that basis. So, the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might be helpful because then the expectation value of P_z would just be the diagonal components multiplied by the probabilities, perhaps.

But wait, no. Because P_z is an operator, and the state is expressed in its eigenbasis. So, the expectation value of P_z would be the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each eigenstate. 

Wait, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me structure this.

First, the uncertainty ΔP_z is given by the square root of [⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²]. So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each basis state's eigenvalue multiplied by the square of the amplitude (since the state is a vector in that basis). Because in the eigenbasis, the operator is diagonal, so the expectation value is straightforward.

Let me look at the matrix for P_z. The matrix is given as:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis states are the eigenvectors corresponding to these. So, the state vector given is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )^T. But wait, does that mean the state is a combination of the eigenstates of P_z? Because the matrix is diagonal, each component corresponds to the coefficient in that eigenstate.

Wait, but the state is given as the eigenstate of P_x. Hmm. But the basis is P_z's eigenbasis. So when we express the state in the P_z basis, the components are the coefficients of each eigenstate. So, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

So, the state is:

ψ = a |+z> + b |0z> + c |-z>

where |+z> is the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, |0z> is the eigenstate with 0, and |-z> is the eigenstate with -ħ
