Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of enthalpy calculations. But I'll take it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, there are three solutions here, so I need to figure out all the possible reactions.

First, let me break down each solution's components. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions, right? And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since Ba is the cation, the formula tells me it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH^-.

The goal is to find the enthalpy change when these three solutions are mixed. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically exothermic, releasing heat (negative enthalpy). The formula I remember is that the enthalpy change (ΔH) is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ ions neutralized. But wait, some sources might use different values, like 57 kcal/mol. Oh right, sometimes the value is given as about 57 kJ per mole of H+ from a monoprotic acid, but I need to check the units in the options.

Wait, the options have both kJ and kcal. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ. So the units vary. I need to make sure I calculate in the correct units and then convert if necessary.

Let me list out the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * (500/1000) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is H+ and Cl- so each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * (300/1000) = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since it's H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * (200/1000) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 *
