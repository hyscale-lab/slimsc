Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, usually described by Hooke's law. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. 

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about how this works in the relativistic case.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. So the maximum speed would be when that potential energy is converted into (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't just use classical mechanics. Option C is probably the non-relativistic case, so it's not the answer here.

In relativity, energy considerations change. The total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)k x², but here x is the amplitude A. So the total energy should be the rest energy plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. Wait, no, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at the maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. But in the relativistic case, the total energy is still conserved. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy when x is A.

So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². 

At the point of maximum speed, which is when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy at maximum speed would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. 

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The total energy E is conserved. At x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero (classically), so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, so E = gamma mc². 

Wait, no, that can't be right because in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So the total energy when the mass is at x=A is the sum of rest energy and potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, but the mass is moving with maximum speed. So the total energy is the relativistic energy, which is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). So setting these equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

We can divide both sides by mc² to simplify:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, so gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term. Let me call it B for simplicity. So B = k A²/(2 m c²). Then gamma = 1 + B.

So 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 + B.

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - (v/c)^2) = (1 + B)^2.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 / (1 + B)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + B)^2].

Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Let me compute it step by step.

First, from 1/(1 - (v/c)^2) = (1 + B)^2.

So 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Then, (v/c)^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + B)^2].

Hmm, maybe I can find a common denominator on the right side. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + B)^2] as [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expanding (1 + B)^2: 1 + 2B + B².

So [1 + 2B + B² - 1] / (1 + B)^2 → (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B(2 + B) / (1 + B)^2.

Wait, but B is k A²/(2 m c²), which is a small term if the amplitude isn't too large because relativistic effects are significant only at high speeds. But regardless, let's proceed.

So v²/c² = [2B + B²]/(1 + B)^2.

Wait, maybe I can factor B from the numerator. So:

Numerator: B (2 + B) → but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 2B + B² as B (2 + B).

Hmm, but perhaps I can make an approximation here. If B is small, say, for small k A²/(m c²), then B is small, and we can approximate (1 + B)^2 as 1+2B. But the problem doesn't state that the amplitude is small, so maybe I shouldn't make that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v_max in terms of c and the parameters.

So let's go back to the expression for gamma:

gamma = (1 + B), where B is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmmm. Let me try to compute this expression. Let me define term D = k A²/(2 m c²). So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2D + D^2) - 1 = 2D + D².

So,

v²/c² = (2D + D²)/(1 + D)^2.

Factor numerator as D (2 + D).

Denominator is (1 + D)^2.

So,

v²/c² = D (2 + D)/(1 + D)^2.

But wait, D is k A²/(2 m c²). Let's plug that back in.

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))^2.

Hmm, perhaps there's a way to simplify this.

Let me factor the denominator:

Denominator is (1 + D)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, because D = (k A²)/(2 m c²), so 1 + D = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So denominator becomes [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

Putting it all back into the expression for v²:

v² = c² * [ (D (2 + D) ) / (1 + D)^2 ) ]

Which is:

v² = c² * [ ( (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )) / ( (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator of the fraction inside: (D (2 + D)) = [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ].

Denominator of the fraction: (1 + D)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ]^2.

So putting it together:

v² = c² * [ { [k A²/(2 m c²)] [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ] } / { [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2 } }

Let me compute the denominator [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2 as ( (2 m c² + k A²) )^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

So when I take the reciprocal, it becomes (2 m c²)^2 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

So the entire fraction becomes:

[ k A²/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] * [ (2 m c²)^2 ) / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) ].

Simplify each part.

First, let me compute (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)).

That can be written as (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

So the numerator becomes [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ].

Multiply these two terms:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / [ (2 m c²)(2 m c²) ) ] = k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4).

So now, the numerator of the entire fraction inside v² is:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4).

Multiply by (2 m c^2)^2, which is 4 m² c^4.

So the numerator becomes [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4)] * 4 m² c^4.

Wait, the (4 m² c^4) in the denominator and numerator will cancel out.

So it's k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

The denominator of this fraction is (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

So putting it all together, the
