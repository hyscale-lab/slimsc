Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the given data includes measured phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if their energy plays a role here. Wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering up to δ4.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) * (δ_l) * (sin δ_l) / (something with sin terms) ) ] multiplied by some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials, but wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction would be θ=0 degrees. So the scattering angle is zero.

Wait, I think when θ is zero, the scattering is along the beam, and the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by a specific expression. Let me recall. Oh, right! For elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum over all orbital angular momentum states l of (2l+1) times sin(δ_l) times e^{i δ_l}, but wait, no, that might not be exactly right.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part, Im f(0), is related to the total cross-section. Oh, right! The optical theorem says that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = 4π |f(0)|^2, but wait, the optical theorem is more specific. Let me think: the theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (Im f(0)) is equal to (k/(4π)) * σ_total, but maybe I'm mixing some factors here.

Wait, no. The optical theorem is that the total cross-section is given by:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im [f(0)]

Because the forward scattering direction (θ=0) is where the phase shifts contribute in a specific way. So, if I can find Im f(0), I can relate it to the total cross-section, but wait, the problem doesn't give me any cross-section values. Hmm, so maybe I'm going in the wrong direction.

Wait, let's go back. The scattering amplitude for each partial wave l is given by:

f_l(k) = ( (k/(2l+1)) ) ( (sin δ_l ) / (cos δ_l - i) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f_l is ( ( (sin δ_l) ) / (1 - i cot δ_l) ) * something.

Wait, another formula I remember: The partial wave amplitude a_l is given by a_l = ( ( sin δ_l ) / ( (2l+1) (
