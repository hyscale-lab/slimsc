Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups typically have an absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹. So the compound must have an ester functional group. 

Looking at the NMR data: there are six signals. Breaking them down:
- Two aromatic-H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that cause two distinct environments for the aromatic protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, there would be two sets of aromatic protons, each as a pair. Wait, no, wait—di-substituted benzene has two substituents. The substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. 

Wait, but the two aromatic signals: if substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons—each set as two equivalent Hs. So in the NMR, that would be two singlets, each integrating to 2H. But in our case, the NMR has two aromatic signals. So each could be integrating to two H each? Or maybe one is integrating to two and the other to two as well? Not sure.

Wait, the NMR description says two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So maybe each is a doublet or something. Hmm.

Then, two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, so maybe the substituents include an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Like an ester with a substituent that's a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH- something), but what would that look like in an aromatic compound?

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring. Let's think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group. The other substituent could be a vinyl group or something that leads to two vinyl protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps each substituent has a vinyl group. No, that's probably not the case. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, an ester group attached with some substituent that has a double bond. Let's think about the structure.

Suppose the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like OAc, but more likely a larger ester), and the other is a vinyl group. Or maybe one substituent is a vinyl group, and the other is an ester group. 

Wait, but vinyl protons are on a double bond. So perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH- something attached to the ring). But that might complicate the substitution pattern.

Wait, or maybe the substituent is a group that has a double bond adjacent, such as a styryl group (like CH₂=CH-O-...). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group has a double bond, leading to vinyl protons. For example, if
