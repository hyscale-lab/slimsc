Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're doing this by modifying the gene's coding sequence to add a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they're using Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they test the expression, they can't overexpress the protein. They checked the plus strand sequence of their construct, and apparently there's an issue there.

The question is asking why they can't overexpress the protein. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is the reason.

Let me start by looking at the construct's sequence. The plus strand is given, so I should look for any issues in the coding sequence. Remember, the coding sequence (CDS) starts with ATG (the start codon) and ends with a stop codon, which is usually one of TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at the sequence, let me find where the ATG is. The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CC... So the first three nucleotides are ATG, which is correct for the start codon. Now, I need to find the stop codon at the end. Let me go to the end of the sequence. The last part is ...CTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

Wait, let me scan for the stop codon. The stop codons are TAG, TGA, TAA. Let me look at the very end. The last line ends with ...GAGTGA. Let me see the last few codons. The last part is GAGTGA. Breaking it down: each codon is three nucleotides. Let me see: 

Looking at the end, the sequence is ...GAGTGA. Wait, that's GAG TGA. So the last codon is TGA. Oh, but wait, is that the case? Let me see: The sequence at the end is ...AGTGA. Wait, wait. Let me count from the end. The last few nucleotides are TGA. Let me double-check. 

Wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So that's G A G T G A. No, wait, the last three are TGA. Because, the last part is GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So that seems correct.

Hmm, but why then can't they overexpress the protein? The construct seems to have a proper start and stop. Let me think about the options.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Wait, the hemagglutinin sequence is at the N-terminus. If it has a mutation, maybe the protein isn't expressed because it's not recognized by the purification method. But the question is about overexpression, not about purification. So maybe the construct isn't expressed because the tag is messed up. Or perhaps the mutation affects the protein's stability or function. But the question is about why it's not overexpressing, so maybe the protein is being made but not in high amounts. Or perhaps the mutation causes a premature stop codon. Hmm, but the given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop.

Wait, the plus strand is shown. Let me make sure whether the actual coding sequence is correct. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except that mRNA is synthesized from the template strand. Wait, no, the plus strand is the same as mRNA, except mRNA is complementary to the template (minus) strand. So the plus strand of the construct would correspond to the mRNA, right? Wait, no, actually, the plus strand is the non-template strand in DNA. So the coding sequence is the same as the plus strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to the minus strand. So the construct's plus strand has the coding sequence, so the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand. So the start is ATG, which is correct, and the stop is TGA.

Wait, looking again, the plus strand sequence is given, and the stop codon is TGA. So the coding sequence is correct. So the issue isn't a stop codon in the wrong place, unless there's an early stop.

Wait, does the sequence have any in-frame stop codons before the final TGA? Let me scan through the sequence.

The sequence is quite long, but perhaps I can look for any TAG, TGA, or TAA codons. Let's see, for example:

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TGA: the last part is ...GAGTGA. So that's the stop. Is there another TGA earlier? Let's see. Let me scan for TGA triplets.

Looking at the middle: ...ACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, looking for TGA:

Another possible TGA is in the middle: ...CTTGAACGTGGAC... So that's T T G AA C... So the TGA is part of 'TGAAC', so the codon would be TGA. Let's see: positions ...CTTGAAC... The TGA is in positions 12-14? Let's count: CTT GAA CGT GAC. So in the sequence, the triplet 'GAA' is at positions 13-15. Wait, but GAA is a codon for glutamic acid, not a stop. So no, that's not a stop codon.

Another possible spot: ...ATAGTGCGCGTG... So that would be ATA GTG CGC GTG. Not seeing a stop codon there.

Wait, another spot: ...GTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACG... So the 'TGA' is in 'TGAACGT' â€” so the codon is TGA, which is a stop. So that's at position ...TGAACGT. Wait, that's the middle of the sequence, not the end. So if there's a TGA in the middle, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Wait, let me get the exact spot. Looking at the sequence again, perhaps in the middle: ...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking for TGA:

Looking for 'TGA' in the sequence. Let's go through:

- The start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCG AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TT...

Ah, here we go. The sequence includes 'TGAACGT', so that's the triplet TGA followed by ACG. So 'TGA' is a codon for stop. So in the middle of the sequence, there's a TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh no! So the construct has an early stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein or no protein at all. That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed.

So the problem is that there's an in-frame stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, which is causing the ribosome to stop prematurely. So the issue is that the coding sequence includes a stop codon, leading to early termination of translation.

Looking at the options:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That seems to fit. Because the presence of an in-frame stop codon would cause the ribosome to stop early, so the protein isn't made to completion. Hence, the lack of overexpression.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. But the problem is the presence of a stop codon, not a mutation in the HA sequence. So unless the HA is part of the stop codon, but the HA is at the N-terminus. The stop codon is in the middle, so I don't think option A is correct.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. Hmm, proteolysis would degrade the protein after it's made. But in this case, the protein isn't being expressed at all. Also, the question is about overexpression, so if the protein is being made but quickly degraded, the levels would be low. But if the construct has a stop codon, the protein isn't made correctly. So this might not be the issue.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, the stop codon here is TGA, not UAA. The stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So D is not correct because the stop is TGA, and regardless, tRNAs don't recognize stop codons; it's the release factors.

So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early because of the in-frame TGA stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model fails to overexpress the GADD45G protein, despite the construct being designed with a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. The provided sequence of the plus strand of the construct reveals that it starts with the correct start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TGA). However, a critical issue arises in the middle of the sequence: the presence of an in-frame stop codon (TGA) before the intended termination. This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. Consequently, the protein is not expressed at the expected levels, explaining the failure to overexpress GADD45G.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.  
  This is incorrect because the issue is not with the hemagglutinin tag but with the premature stop codon in the coding sequence.

- **Option B:** The ribosome terminated the translation early.  
  This is correct. The in-frame TGA stop codon in the middle of the sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing full-length protein expression.

- **Option C:** The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.  
  This is incorrect because proteolysis would degrade the protein after it is synthesized, but the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all due to early termination.

- **Option D:** The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.  
  This is incorrect because the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Additionally, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs.

The correct answer is that the premature stop codon caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing proper protein expression.

**Answer: B**
