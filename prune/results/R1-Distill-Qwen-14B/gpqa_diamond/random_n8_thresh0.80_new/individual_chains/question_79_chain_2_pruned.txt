Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to understand what's going on.

The question says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I need to find out what compound X is by looking at the options provided.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh, right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. But wait, no, wait. Oh, no, Sharpless uses a different reagent. Wait, maybe that's for epoxidation. Or is it another reaction? Hmm. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, sometimes used in various reactions, maybe in epoxide formation. Or perhaps it's involved in a ring-opening reaction. Alternatively, could this be about an epoxide ring opening?

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So, the reaction must be transforming the starting material into something else. But the question is about identifying the starting compound X. So, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation. Because, for example, if X is an alkene, treating it with something could form an epoxide.

Wait, but Sharpless epoxid
