Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break down the information step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Solid A reacts with gas B in an 8:1 ratio to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C is treated with water, it reforms A and produces two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Lastly, gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I should start by figuring out what compounds A, B, C, D, and E might be. Let's consider the reactions and properties given.

The first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) or maybe a transition metal complex, but wait, another thought comes to mind. Oh, wait! Maybe it's sulfuric acid related? Or perhaps a reaction involving sulfur.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C could be a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, if C is something like a sulfite or sulfate ester, but wait, another possibility comes to mind. What if C is a nitrate? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate or something else.

Wait, let's think about the acids. F is strong, G is weak. Common strong acids are H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak acids are like acetic acid, H3PO4, etc. So when C reacts with water, it gives F (strong) and G (weak), along with A. So maybe C is a compound that breaks down into these acids.

Another thought: If C is a sulfide, but that might not fit. Or perhaps it's a metal sulfite or sulfate. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, and B is oxygen. Let me think: sulfur (solid A) reacting with oxygen (gas B) to form SO3 (C). Then SO3 reacting with another gas D. Wait, what's gas D? If D is water vapor, but D is a gas, so maybe it's H2O(g), but I'm not sure. Wait, the next reaction: C + D → E. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's a gas like chlorine or something else.

Wait, let's get back to A. When C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So if C is SO3, then upon reacting with water, it would form H2SO4. But that gives only one acid, not two. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride? Or perhaps a nitrate ester?

Wait, another approach: looking at the second reaction, C reacts with D (gas) to produce E. And D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B make something that's a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But if B and D react in a 1:1 ratio, maybe they form something like H2O, but that's a product when B is O2 and D is H2. Wait, no, O2 and H2 would react to form H2O, but that requires a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is another gas.

Wait, perhaps B is O2. Then, D is Cl2? Because Cl2 is a gas, and O2 plus Cl2 wouldn't form a solvent unless under certain conditions, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then they would form H2O. Water is a solvent, so H could be H2O. But how about the first reaction? A (solid) + 8 B → C. So if A is S (solid), B is O2, then 8 O2 would react with S to form SO3, which is a bright red solid. That fits! Because SO3 is a solid and is bright in color, I think.

So A is S, B is O2. Then C is SO3. Because the reaction is S + 8 O2 → SO3? Wait, no, wait the formula for sulfur trioxide is SO3. So the balanced equation would be S (s) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 SO3 (l or s). But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, so maybe I'm off. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the stoichiometry: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → C.

If A is S, then the reaction would be S + O2 → SO3. Let me balance that.

S + O2 → SO3.

Balancing:
