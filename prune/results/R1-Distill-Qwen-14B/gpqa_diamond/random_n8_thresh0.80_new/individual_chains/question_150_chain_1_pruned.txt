Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what the structure is. Then, it's reacted with a series of reagents, and I have to identify the final product from the options given.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I'll try to interpret each of these.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's pretty upfield for an aromatic proton? Wait, no, aromatic protons are usually around 6.5-8.5 ppm. Oh wait, 9.72 is more like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde group.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. That sounds like two sets of aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring each. So each of these might be from two different benzene rings, each with substituents. Since they're doublets, maybe they're adjacent to another substituent? Or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system, like in a para-substituted ring.

The peak at 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests exchange or perhaps being part of an aromatic ring adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but aromatic protons are usually more downfield, so maybe these are vinyl protons? Or perhaps they're in a conjugated system, like allylic to an aldehyde.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, maybe oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's CH2 connected to another CH2, but the doublet suggests two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but that wouldn't be a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a methine group, but no, it's two protons.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. So, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C8H9NO. So:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), plus an aldehyde (1), and a double bond (1), making 5. Or maybe other combinations, but benzene plus an aldehyde and a double bond is likely.

So perhaps the structure is something like an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring, with another substituent. But wait, the NMR has two sets of aromatic protons, each 2H as doublets. So two benzene rings, each para-substituted.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if it's two benzene rings, each is C6H5, but that would be C12, which is way beyond. Oh, wait, perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's only eight carbons. So maybe a benzene ring connected to a smaller substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with
