Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question starts by describing a series of reactions, so maybe I should outline each reaction first. Let's see:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what these compounds are. Let's start with reaction 4 since it might give me a clue about D and B.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). The ratio is 1:1. Solvents are often simple molecules. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But since D is a gas reacting with B (also a gas), and H is a solvent, perhaps H is something like HCl, but wait, HCl is a gas as well. Hmm, maybe D is something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid; G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc., while weak acids are like acetic acid, HNO2, etc.

So, if C reacts with water to form A, and two acids, maybe C is a salt. Like a sulfide reacting with water to produce a metal hydroxide and H2S? Or maybe a nitride reacting to produce NH3 and some acid.

Wait, another thought: if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps the reaction is something like C (a metal nitride) reacting with water to produce a metal hydroxide (which might decompose further?), but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product... Maybe it's a metal oxide? Or something like CuO isn't red. Wait, I remember that when certain metals react with other substances, they form colored products. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe some other compounds. Oh, wait, maybe C is a sulfide? No, sulfides are usually not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride or something else.

Wait, perhaps this is about the Haber process. Wait, that produces ammonia, which isn't bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving copper or another transition metal.

Wait, another approach: the products in reaction 3 are A, F, and G. So when C is treated with water, it gives back A, plus two acids. So perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a base and an acid. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids.

Wait, let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous products might include things like phosgene, sarin gas, or other toxics. Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO3 (sulfur trioxide), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2 or something else. Wait, but D is a gas reacting with C in a 2:1 ratio.

Wait, let's go back to reaction 4. D and B form H, which is a solvent. So if B is, say, H2, then D could be something else... Hmm, not sure.

Another angle: Reaction 3's products are A, F, and G. So maybe A is a metal, and C is a metal oxide, which upon hydrolysis gives back the metal (A), and produces two acids. But how?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide or a salt that can dissociate into two different anions, each reacting with water to form acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that probably wouldn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. Wait, if C is a nitride like Mg3N2, which upon reaction with water produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if A is Fe, and B is S, then C would be FeS. FeS reacting with water... But FeS is not very reactive with water. Maybe not.

Wait, let me think about reaction 3 again. So when C reacts with water, it gives A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a salt that can be hydrolyzed into two different acids. Like perhaps a metal carbonate reacting with water to produce a base and CO2, but that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's say A is metal M. So C is MNO3. When it reacts with water, it would give M(OH)NO3 or something, but I'm not sure that would produce two different acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else. Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a base and H2O (which isn't an acid). So that's not fitting.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid, maybe it's HCl, and G is a weak acid like H2S. Because HCl is strong, H2S is weak. So in reaction 3, C + H2O → A + HCl + H2S. That would mean C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives both HCl and H2S. So C could be something like H2S·something·Cl? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide salt. For example, suppose A is Fe, and C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, maybe it's not stable and reacts further. But FeS is more stable in acidic conditions, perhaps? Or maybe if it's a different sulfide.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt that contains both S and Cl. For example, maybe C is CuClS. Then, upon hydrolysis, it might produce HCl and H2S. But I'm not sure about the actual reactions here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide of a metal that, when hydrolyzed, produces H2S and a hydroxide. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If E is extremely hazardous, it's possible that E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. Wait, D is a gas, and in reaction 4, D and B form H, a solvent. So B and D are gases, and their reaction gives a solvent. Possible solvents that are products of gas reactions: perhaps H2O, but B and D would need to be O and H2, but that's possible. Wait, but H2O is a solvent. So if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. But then, in reaction 4, B + D → H2O. That would mean B is H2, D is O2. But that seems a bit off because H2 and O2 react to form H2O, but under what conditions? Usually, that requires a spark or catalyst.

But if that's the case, then B is H2 gas, D is O2 gas.

So going back, reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What solid reacts with H2 in large amounts to form a bright red product? Hmm. Maybe a transition metal like Fe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a metal is reduced. Wait, H2 is a reducing agent. So maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is H2, which reduces it to the metal and water. But then, if A is Fe3O4, and B is H2, they would produce Fe and H2O. But the product C would be Fe, which is not bright red.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is CuS, and B is H2, but I'm not sure if that reaction would produce a bright red product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a simple reduction. Let's think about other possibilities. Maybe A is a metal nitride, and B is something else. Wait, nitrides react with H2 to form metals and NH3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like the formation of a metal carbonyl. For example, Fe reacts with CO to form Fe(CO)5, which is a liquid, but not sure about color.

Wait, another angle: bright red product C. What compounds are bright red? For example, mercury(I) nitrate is red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, certain transition metal compounds have red colors. Copper(I) oxide is red, isn't it? So if A reacts with B to form Cu2O, which is bright red. But what would the reaction be?

Cu2O is a solid, but in reaction 1, they produce C as a product. So let's say A is CuO and B is something else. Wait, but CuO plus H2 would produce Cu and H2O. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is S, but that would form CuS, which is black.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a product of a different reaction. Let me think, maybe it's a metal oxide that's red. For example, maybe it's Co oxides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases both a strong and a weak acid.

For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- which can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-. But that would only produce a strong acid (H+ from HSO4^-), not two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, which upon hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2SO3 (which is weak). But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride. Let's say C is Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. MgCO3. Reacting with water would produce Mg(OH)2 and CO2. CO2 is an acid (it's a weak acid). So F could be HCl (strong) and G could be H2CO3 (weak). But then where does the Cl come from? Unless C contains both CO3 and Cl.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate or something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about reaction 2. C reacts with D to form E. If D is O2, and C is a sulfide, maybe E is SO3 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. Let's say E is Cl2. But in that case, C must be something that reacts with Cl2 to produce Cl2... Doesn't make sense. Or perhaps E is O3, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 gives H as H2O. So B is H2, D is O2. Then in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 O2 to form E.

So, in reaction 3, C would be something that reacts with H2O to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2O to form a base and release an acid. For example, if C is Na2O, which reacts with H2O to form NaOH (but that's a base), not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with H2O (especially if heated) to form NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (H2CO3). So that gives us F as strong acid (like HCl?) and G as H2CO3. But where does HCl come from? Unless C has Cl in it.

Wait, maybe C is NaClO3 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal. For example, CuS. But CuS is typically black, not red. Wait, maybe it's FeS? No, that's also black or dark.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a compound of antimony or arsenic. Some of their compounds are red. For example, Sb2O3 is red. Alternatively, maybe it's PbO2 which is dark brown, not red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green. Chromium(VI) compounds can be orange or yellow. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide of cobalt, which can be various colors. For example, CoS is usually black, but some other compounds might be red. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, but MnO might be brown.

Wait, perhaps C is not a metal compound but something else. For example, maybe it's a sulfide of a non-metal, like CS2, but I don't think that's bright red.

Wait, another approach: the bright red product in reaction 1. Could it be something like mercury(I) oxide (HgO) which is red? Then, perhaps when HgO reacts with H2 (as B), it forms Hg and water. But that would be reaction A + H2 → Hg + H2O. So C would be Hg, which is a liquid, not a bright red product. Hmm, perhaps not.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a highly symmetrical molecule. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Or O2 or O3 have certain symmetries.

Wait, D∞h symmetry is for linear molecules like CO2, H2O (though water is bent), O2, etc. So if E were O2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Because O2 is diatomic and has a center of inversion and mirror planes, etc.

Wait, looking back at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is O2, then perhaps C is something that reacts with O2 to form O2 again? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that upon reaction with O2 forms another compound.

Wait, perhaps E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which has a trigonal planar structure, so its symmetry group would be D3h or something else. But phosgene is a toxic gas, so that fits.

But the symmetry of phosgene is D3h, which isn't one of the options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, another possibility: if E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a central oxygen. O3 has a symmetry group of C2v. Because ozone is a bent molecule with a center of inversion and a mirror plane perpendicular to the molecular axis.

Wait, no, ozone's structure is bent with a central O, so the symmetry is D3h, I think. No, wait, ozone has a structure where each O is connected to the central O by a single bond, and the central O has a double bond. The molecule is V-shaped, with bond angles of about 116 degrees. Its symmetry elements include a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and two mirror planes. So the point group would be C2v. Because it has a two-fold rotation axis, and two mirror planes, but no inversion center. Wait, no, an inversion in O3 would not map the molecule onto itself because the central O is different. So yes, C2v symmetry for ozone.

But wait, another possibility: E is SO2, which is bent and has D3h symmetry. Or maybe it's SO3, which is trigonal pyramidal, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry. But then, what reaction would produce O2? Maybe if C is something that upon reaction with O2 gives O2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, reaction 4: D and B form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B must be O2 and H2, respectively. Because H2O is formed from 2 H2 and O2. But in reaction 4, the ratio is 1:1, so maybe it's 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, but that's a 2:1 ratio for H2 to O2. But the reaction states 1:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: D is Cl2 and B is H2, producing HCl gas. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that can't be right. Or perhaps D is NH3 and B is H2O, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, B is CO and D is something else. Maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but the reaction of CO and something else to form methanol. I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let's try to reorient. Let me think about reaction 3 again: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2SO3 (weak acid), then C would have to contain both Cl and S. Hmm, maybe C is a chlorosulfate or something like that. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite salt, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that produces H2S upon hydrolysis. So for example, if C is FeS, then upon hydrolysis, it gives Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. Hmm, this isn't working.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Like if C is NaNO3, but then upon hydrolysis, it would give NaOH and HNO3. So F could be HNO3 (strong acid), and G could be... wait, but NaNO3 hydrolyzes to give NaOH and HNO3, but that's only one acid. So how to get two acids?

Hmm. Maybe C is a mixture, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe C is a different kind of compound.

Wait, another approach: reaction 1 is A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red). So the molar ratio is 1:8 to produce C. That suggests that B is a diatomic molecule because 8 moles of B would likely come from 4 diatomic molecules (since each diatomic has 2 atoms). Wait, but 8 equivalents of B would be 8 moles. So if B is H2, then 8 moles would be 4 molecules. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, and 8 O2 would be 8 moles. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something like the synthesis of a metal carbonyl. For example, Fe reacts with CO to form Fe(CO)5. But I don't know if that's bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a synthesis of a metal hydride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon, and B is something else. For example, carbon reacting with O2 to form CO, but that's a gas, not solid.

This is getting me nowhere. Let's try to think about E's molecular symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is O3 (ozone), symmetry is C2v. If E is SO2, which is bent, but I think its symmetry group is D3h.

If E is a diatomic like O2, symmetry is D∞h.

If E is a molecule like H2O, symmetry is D2h, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is phosgene (COCl2). Its structure is planar, with two Cl atoms. Its symmetry group is D2h, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule like CH4, but that's not extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2 gas. Cl2 is diatomic, which would have D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a yellow gas, not extremely hazardous? Well, it's toxic, but maybe the question refers to something more dangerous.

Wait, another thought: what if E is HCN? But HCN is a linear molecule (like H-C≡N), so its symmetry group is D∞h. But does it fit the reactions?

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN. Hmmm.

But earlier, from reaction 4, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is CO (carbon monoxide), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO isn't extremely hazardous in low concentrations, but it can be lethal. Hmm.

Alternatively, E could be NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous. Wait, maybe E is something like sarin gas, but I don't know its structure. Sarin is an organophosphorus compound, which is quite complex.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly symmetrical molecule like O2 or O3.

Wait, O2 has D∞h symmetry. O3 has C2v symmetry. If E is O3, which is a toxic gas, that might fit the description.

But how would reaction 2 produce O3? C would have to react with D to form O3. For that, D might be O2, and C would have to have oxygen. Let me think.

Alternatively, reaction 2: C reacts with D to produce E. If E is O3, then perhaps D is O2 and C is something else that upon reaction with O2 produces O3. But that would require some specific conditions, like UV light.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClO2, which is a toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure, similar to O3, so its symmetry group would be C2v. ClO2 is a strong oxidizing agent and is toxic.

But how would that fit in? Let me think about the reactions.

If reaction 4: D + B → H. If D is ClO and B is O2, H might be ClO2? But ClO + O2 would produce ClO2? I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is O2, but their reaction would produce ClO2 under certain conditions. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe reaction 4 is D (Cl2) + B (O2) → H (ClO2?), but I don't know the stoichiometry.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let's focus on the molecular symmetry options.

If E's symmetry is D∞h, it would be a diatomic molecule. So if E is O2, Cl2, CO, etc., which are linear.

If E has D4h symmetry, that suggests a molecule with a four-fold axis, like a square planar or octahedral structure, but those are less likely for a diatomic.

C2v symmetry would mean a bent molecule with certain symmetry elements. O3 and ClO2 fit this.

So, if E is O3, symmetry is C2v. If E is ClO2, symmetry is also C2v.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is bent, but its symmetry is D3h, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the answer is C2v symmetry group, which would be option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

The options are:
A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is O3, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O2, symmetry is D∞h (option C). But I'm not sure what E is.

Looking back at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If E is O3, then perhaps C is O2 and D is H2O or something else, but that doesn't fit the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)Cl. Its structure is planar, so D2h symmetry, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: E is a planar molecule like SO2, but that's D3h.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is CH2Cl2, but that's not a gas and doesn't fit the extremely hazardous part.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly symmetrical molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. CO2 is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but can cause suffocation. So maybe.

But how would reaction 2 form CO2? That would suggest C is a carbonate or something. Wait, in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). If F is HCl and G is H2CO3, then C would be a chlorinated carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaHCO3, which upon hydrolysis would produce NaOH, CO2, and H2O. But that's not two acids.

This is getting too complicated. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the symmetry options and the fact that E is a toxic gas. If E is O3, then symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O2, then D∞h (option C). Alternatively, if E is CO, then D∞h.

But the question states that E is produced by C reacting with D in a 2:1 ratio. If E is O3, then perhaps C is O2 and D is something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry as a linear molecule. So that would be option C.

Wait, but HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But how would that fit into the reactions? I'm not sure.

Given the confusion, I think the most plausible answer based on the symmetry options and E being a toxic gas is that E has D∞h symmetry, making the answer C. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a planar structure. Phosgene is a toxic gas. Its symmetry is D∞h because it's linear? No, wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is planar but not linear. So its symmetry is D∞h? No, wait, planar with a central atom would have D∞h symmetry. Because it's linear in terms of symmetry elements. Wait, no, phosgene's structure is trigonal planar, but that's not exactly linear. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or Cl2. If E is O2, the symmetry is D∞h, option C.

But earlier, I thought reaction 4 might involve O2 as D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is a diatomic, then symmetry is D∞h.

Wait, but Cl2 is a yellow gas, not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but it's toxic. So perhaps E is Cl2, which would have D∞h symmetry.

So putting it all together, if E is Cl2, the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe E is O3, which would be C2v (option D).

Hmm. I think I'll go with option C, D∞h, but I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a transition metal compound, possibly a sulfide, nitride, or oxide. However, the exact identity of C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a toxic gas, and its molecular symmetry is the focus of the question. Possible candidates for E include diatomic molecules like O₂, Cl₂, or linear molecules like CO or HCN, which have high symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C could be a salt or compound that hydrolyzes to release acids. For example, if C contains both Cl and S, it might produce HCl (strong acid) and H₂S (weak acid). However, the exact identity of C is not definitively determined.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water (H₂O), then B and D could be H₂ and O₂, respectively. This aligns with the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, though the stoichiometry in the problem is 1:1, which complicates this interpretation.

### Molecular Symmetry Analysis:
- **Option A (C₂)**: This symmetry group corresponds to a molecule with a single twofold axis of rotation. It is unlikely for E, as most toxic gases like O₂, Cl₂, or HCN have higher symmetry.
- **Option B (D₄h)**: This symmetry group is typical for square planar or octahedral molecules. It does not fit the likely diatomic or linear nature of E.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: This symmetry group applies to linear molecules like O₂, Cl₂, or CO. These are diatomic and highly symmetrical, making D∞h a plausible choice if E is a diatomic gas like O₂ or Cl₂.
- **Option D (C₂v)**: This symmetry group corresponds to bent molecules like O₃ or ClO₂. If E is a bent molecule, C₂v would be the correct symmetry group.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the analysis, E is most likely a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. If E were O₂ or Cl₂, this would align with the description of a toxic gas and the symmetry group D∞h. While O₃ or ClO₂ could also fit, their bent structures suggest C₂v symmetry, which is less likely based on the provided options.

**Answer: C**
