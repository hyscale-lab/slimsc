Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question says there's a solution with 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds pretty tightly to metal ions like calcium.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. Wait, wait. Formation constants are usually for the complex formation. So Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) combine to form CaY^2-. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So I need to find [Ca²+]. Since the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, that's the concentration of the complex.

Assuming that the pH is ideal, I suppose that the concentration of free EDTA (Y^4-) is... well, I think that EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and under certain pH conditions, it exists in different protonated forms. But at the right pH, most of it is in the Y^4- form. So I can probably assume that the concentration of Y^4- is approximately the same as the concentration of free EDTA in solution, but wait, no. Oh, no, wait. If the complex is in solution, then the total EDTA is the sum of the free EDTA (Y^4-) and the EDTA bound to calcium (CaY²-). But I'm not given any information about the total EDTA concentration. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the question says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex." Oh, right, stoichiometric means that the molar ratio is 1:1. So for every mole of Ca, there's a mole of EDTA. So in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means the total EDTA concentration is equal to [CaY²-] + [Y^4-]. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, then [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

But without knowing the amount of free EDTA, how can I proceed? Hmm. Wait, but maybe the solution is such that the EDTA is in excess, and most
