Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says: A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. So, normally, when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. The formula I remember is v = c/n, where v is the speed in the medium. But this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer.

But here, the glass is moving. So, how does that affect the observed speed of light? I'm a bit confused. I think I need to consider the concept of relativity here, but wait, is it special relativity or just classical mechanics?

Wait, in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is u' = u + v, where u is the velocity of the object in the frame, and v is the velocity of the frame. But wait, when dealing with light, things get tricky because according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames.

Wait a second, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, but here the light is in a medium (glass). So maybe special relativity doesn't apply directly here. Or does it?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is v_light = c/n, which is 1/n since c=1.

But when the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, how does that affect the observed speed of the light? I think I need to consider the velocity addition formula from classical mechanics because the speeds involved are probably non-relativistic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether to use relativity or not. Oh, but the speed of light in glass is v_glass = 1/n. But when the glass is moving, would the observed speed just be v_glass + v?

Wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the
