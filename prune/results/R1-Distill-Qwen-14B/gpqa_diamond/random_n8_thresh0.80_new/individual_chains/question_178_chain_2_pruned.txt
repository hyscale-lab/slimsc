Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension helps determine renormalizability. Let me think step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). So the entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

Each field has a certain mass dimension. Let's recall: for a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, which has dimension 2, I think. Wait, no, wait. F_{μν} is the field strength for electromagnetism, which is a derivative of the gauge field A, so F has the same dimension as ∂μ Aν, since F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Aμ has dimension 1 (since it's like a gauge field, similar to a vector potential which has mass dimension 1 in QED), so F_{μν} has dimension 2. So F^{μν} would also have dimension 2, since it's just a different index arrangement.

So looking at the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each part contributes. So let's break it down.

ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives or fields). So σ_{μν} doesn’t contribute any mass dimension. Then ψ is another 3/2. F^{μν} is dimension 2.

So the product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So the entire term without κ has mass dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So κ must have a dimension such that when multiplied by 5, the total is 4. So dimension of κ would be 4 - 5 = -1. Because [κ] * (5) = 4 → [κ] = 4/5? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I mixed up. The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by the product. The product's dimension is 5, so the term is [κ] * 5 = 4. So [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the interaction term having operators of mass dimension less than or equal to 4.
