Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass with a certain refractive index, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. The formula I know is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index. So normally, in the glass, the light's speed is 1/n, since c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So this adds another layer. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says the glass is moving toward the observer, but in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, but towards the observer. Wait, no, that might not make sense. Let me reread the question. It says, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory." Oh, so the glass is moving toward the observer, and its direction of motion is the same as the light beam's direction. So the light is moving, say, to the right, and the glass is moving to the right as well, towards the observer. Wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the observer is at rest, and the glass is moving towards them. So if the light is in the glass and moving in the same direction as the glass's movement, that would mean the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is also moving towards the observer, so their velocities might add up in some way.

Wait, no. Think about it. The light is propagating through the glass, which itself is moving. So the light's speed within the glass is v_light = 1/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, I think this is a problem that involves the addition of velocities in special relativity. But wait, no, because the speed of light
