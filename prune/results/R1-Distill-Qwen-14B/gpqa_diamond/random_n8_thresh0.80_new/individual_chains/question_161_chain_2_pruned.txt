Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem.

So, Mike designed a high-res TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas particles because they can interfere with the electron beam. But even in that vacuum state, some gas molecules are present—detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path, I remember, depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the average speed of the molecules. Oh right, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule's diameter, and P is the pressure.

Wait, but when he started the electron beam, the mean free path became λ2 instead of staying λ1. The sample's temperature remained the same, so T didn't change. What else could affect the mean free path? Oh! The electron beam itself. The electrons are moving at high speeds—close to the speed of light maybe? Because 1000 kV is a high accelerating voltage.

Now, the mean free path in the gas is due to the gas molecules colliding with each other, right? But when the electron beam is on, the electrons can interact with the gas molecules too. Wait, but in this case, are the gas molecules the ones moving, or the electrons? I think the gas molecules are much slower compared to the electrons. But in terms of collisions, the mean free path would be about how often the gas molecules collide with each other and with the electrons.

Wait, the mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So, if there's an external factor causing more collisions, λ would decrease. Because more collisions mean the molecules don't go as far before hitting something else.

In the initial state (when the electron beam wasn't on), the mean free path was λ1. But when the electron beam starts, the electrons are moving and might be colliding with gas molecules. So, the gas molecules could be colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

Wait, but the electrons are moving much faster. So, from the gas molecules' perspective, the electrons are moving quickly and could act as obstacles. So, the
