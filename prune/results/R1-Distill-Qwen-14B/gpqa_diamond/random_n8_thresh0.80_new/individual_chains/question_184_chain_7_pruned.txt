Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about figuring out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, in benzene, numbering starts with the substituents in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's see: 2 has a tert-butyl group, 1 has an ethoxy group, and 3 has a nitro group. So the substituents are at the ortho, meta positions. Wait, no, 1,2,3 are consecutive, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, actually, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene has three substituents. Let's number the ring so that the ethoxy is at position 1, the nitro at position 3, and the tert-butyl at position 2. That makes sense because in such numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers.

So, the substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at 1, nitro (NO2) at 3, and t-butyl at 2. So looking at the ring, positions 1,2,3 are all substituted.

Now, the question is about the reaction sequence to make this compound starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effect of substituents is crucial. So I need to plan the order of adding these groups to the ring.

Let's think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (OEt) is an activating group (since it's an ether) and is ortho/para directing.
2. Nitro group (NO2) is a deactivating, meta directing group.
3. tert-Butyl group is a bulky, activating but ortho/para directing (since it's an alkyl group).

But wait, the nitro group is
