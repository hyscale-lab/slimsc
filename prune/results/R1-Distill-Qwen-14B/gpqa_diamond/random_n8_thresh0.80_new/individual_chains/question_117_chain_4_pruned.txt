Okay, I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations. I need to figure out which ones are chiral, meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, which are carbons bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, sometimes other forms of asymmetry like allenes or certain ring structures can cause chirality, but I think the main point here is looking for chiral centers.

Looking at each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Hmm. Let me visualize this. It's a biphenyl structure, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6' positions and carboxylate groups on the 2' positions. So each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl group? Or wait, the substituents are on the central ring? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the main structure is a biphenyl with two nitro groups on each ring, and two carboxylate groups attached. Since the two rings are connected by a single bond, there's a possibility of rotation, but wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then maybe it's not chiral. Wait, no, because if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is dimethyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate with 6,6'-dinitro substituents. So the main chain is the biphenyl. Each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. Are the substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral? If the substituents are in a symmetrical positions, then the molecule might not be chiral. Wait, if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each
