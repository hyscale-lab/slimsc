Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, there are three solutions here, so I have to think carefully about how they interact.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Their volumes and concentrations are provided. Let me jot them down:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when these solutions are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Let me think about each solution individually.

For HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. That gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: It's a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So I need to calculate its moles.

H2SO4 volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. So H+ from H2SO4 is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Then Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base, and each mole produces 2 moles of OH- because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

Ba(OH)2 volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ and OH- in the mixture:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when they mix, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The amount of heat depends on the moles reacting.

But I should check which one is in excess. Let's see: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain unreacted.

But for the neutralization enthalpy, only the moles that actually react contribute. So the reaction will involve 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-. So if I have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, they will neutralize each other until one runs out. So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water. The remaining 0.08 H+ will be in solution, making it acidic.

So the neutralization here is for 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

But wait, what about the enthalpy? The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting, right? For strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy is around -57.3 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol) per mole of H+.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So for each mole of H+ that reacts, you get about -57.3 kJ.

In this case, we have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it's in solution, it can donate two H+ ions. But in the reaction with a base, only the first H+ might be considered for neutralization. Or is it both?

Wait, no. Let me think. In neutralization, each H+ from the acid will react with an OH- from the base. So if we have 0.28 moles of H+ (0.1 from HCl and 0.18 from H2SO4), and 0.2 moles of OH-, all of the OH- will react, and 0.08 H+ will remain. So the total H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is based on 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Wait, but the options are given in both kcal and kJ. Let's check.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ and OH- quantities. Let me recalculate.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, but since it's diprotic, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 moles of OH-. Correct.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

Wait, but wait: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles of OH- right. So that's correct.

So the calculation is 0.2 moles H+ reacting. So 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) is approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options are exactly that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is quite a bit higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: H2SO4 is a strong acid, but when it's in solution, it donates both H+ ions. But when it reacts with a base, each H+ would contribute to the neutralization. But in the presence of excess H+, perhaps the other H+ doesn't get neutralized because the OH- is limited.

Wait no, the neutralization would proceed as H+ + OH- → H2O. So as long as H+ and OH- are available, they react. So in our case, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of each react, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry, or perhaps I should consider the number of equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each mole reacts with two moles of OH-. But wait, no, because each mole of H+ can react with one mole of OH-.

Wait, think about the neutralization reaction:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O (l)  ΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol

So for each H+ that reacts, -57.3 kJ is released.

In our case, 0.2 moles of H+ react. So 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So the closest option is B) -11.42 kcal? Wait no, because that's in kcal. Wait, perhaps I should convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, let's compute -11.46 kJ in kcal.

-11.46 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -2.736 kcal. Hmm, which is close to option A) -2.72 kcal. But that's only considering H+ from HCl and part of H2SO4.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the H+ calculation?

Wait, HCl gives 0.1 H+.

H2SO4 gives 0.09 moles, which is 0.18 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 H+ and OH- neutralize. So 0.2 * 57.3 kJ is 11.46 kJ released, so negative because it's exothermic. So in kJ, it's -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.42 *4.184 ≈ -47.6 kJ, which is way off.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the moles of H+ and OH- again. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total equivalents.

Wait, another approach: The equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents of acid = normality × volume (L).

HCl is monoprotic: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 is diprotic: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 eq.

Total acid equivalents = 0.28 eq.

Ba(OH)2 is diprotic (since each mole gives 2 OH-): 0.5 M * 0.2 L * 2 = 0.2 eq.

So the acid has 0.28 eq, base has 0.2 eq. The neutralization will proceed until the base is exhausted, leaving 0.08 eq of acid.

But the neutralization is of 0.2 eq of H+ and 0.2 eq of OH-.

So the reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- → 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the heat capacity of the solution or something else? No, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization, which is a molar quantity, so perhaps I should calculate per mole of reaction, but the given options may have different units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total enthalpy change for all the H+ that reacts. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the neutralization to be complete, but that's not the case here because the OH- is less.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps another approach: When you mix these solutions, you have to consider all the H+ and OH- from each solution.

So let me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4:

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

OH- comes from Ba(OH)2:

0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So when mixed, OH- will react with H+.

So, neutralization will occur until either H+ or OH- is exhausted.

Since OH- is 0.2 mol and H+ is 0.28, OH- will be completely consumed, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (heat of neutralization per mole of H+).

Assuming that the heat of neutralization is -57.3 kJ per mole of H+, the total ΔH is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Hmm, so that's approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. So maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid reacting, not per mole of H+.

Wait, no, because neutralization typically involves the H+ and OH- ions. So it's per mole of H+.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+ ions, but in neutralization, each H+ reacts separately. So for each mole of H2SO4, two moles of OH- are needed. But in this case, the OH- is limited, so perhaps only part of the H2SO4's H+ is neutralized.

Wait, no, because as earlier, the OH- is 0.2 mol, and the H+ from all acids is 0.28. So all 0.2 OH- will react with 0.2 H+.

So the total enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ.

But the options don't have that. D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16,000 J.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the units of the problem. Because sometimes enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and calculating the heat based on that.

So 0.2 moles reacting: 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, -11.42 kcal is approximately -48.3 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ). So that's about -48 kJ, which is way higher than our calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 11.42 kcal to kJ: 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.69 kJ. So option B is -47.69 kJ, which is way higher than our -11.46 kJ.

So that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Like maybe -13.6 kcal/mol, which is equivalent to -57.3 kJ/mol.

So using that as a basis: 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Which matches option A.

Hmm, so that would make the answer A) -2.72 kcal.

But why would that be the case? Because maybe the problem is calculating per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2 is diprotic, 0.1 moles → 0.2 OH-.

So again, the OH- is 0.2 moles, which neutralizes 0.2 H+.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

But why would the enthalpy per mole of H+ be -13.6 kcal/mol? Because 57.3 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.6).

So perhaps the problem is using kcal as the unit. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought the answer was -11.46 kJ, but that's in kJ. So now I'm confused. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the calculation is done in kcal, option A fits. But if in kJ, it's -11.46 kJ, which is not an option, but option D is -16 kJ, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the neutralization.

Let me re-calculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L =0.1 moles → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ total = 0.28, OH- =0.2.

The neutralization results in 0.2 moles of H2O formed, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ.

But that doesn't match any options except if there's a mistake in the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from H2SO4 to react, but the OH- is insufficient. So the neutralization stops when OH- is used up.

Wait, yes, that's what I had before. So the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a different approach. Maybe it's considering the mixing of the three solutions, so the total volume is 500+300+200 = 1000 mL or 1 L.

But I think that doesn't affect the moles, just the concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4, but only a certain amount reacts.

Wait, no, because the OH- is 0.2, which can neutralize 0.2 H+. So regardless of the source of H+, it's 0.2 that reacts.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents. The equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.28 eq.

Base equivalents: Ba(OH)2 → 0.5 M *0.2 L * 2 =0.2 eq.

So the acid has 0.28 eq, base has 0.2 eq. So all the base's equivalents will react.

So the neutralization is 0.2 eq.

Each equivalent releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But that's not an option. Wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal.

Wait, let's compute 11.46 kJ in kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈2.736 kcal.

So 11.46 kJ is about 2.736 kcal. But in the negative, so -2.736 kcal, which is close to option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that makes sense now. So the total enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is -2.736 kcal. The option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So why would the problem calculate in kcal? Probably because the given options include kcal and kJ.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when all three solutions are mixed.

Wait, another angle: perhaps because H2SO4 is a strong acid and contributes two H+ per molecule, but the neutralization only for the first H+ or something. No, that doesn't make sense. Both H+ should be available for neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with H2SO4 first, and then the HCl. Let me think about that.

Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 react in a neutralization reaction. The balanced equation would be:

Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. So 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 would react, but wait, we have 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is 0.09, so all of it would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The reaction is 1:1, so 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2.

After that, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 moles) would react with HCl.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So their reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

The stoichiometry is 2 moles of HCl per 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of Ba(OH)2 left after reacting with H2SO4: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

To react with this, HCl needed: 0.02 moles.

Moles of HCl available: 0.1.

So 0.02 moles of HCl will react with the remaining Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.08 moles of HCl.

So in this scenario, the total neutralization would involve:

- H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. This produces 0.18 moles of H2O (since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH-; but wait, the reaction is 1:1, but produces 2 H2O per mole. So 0.09 moles → 0.18 moles H2O.

- Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 moles) reacts with 0.02 moles HCl to produce 0.02 moles H2O.

So total H2O produced from neutralization: 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.2 moles.

Each mole of H2O formation releases 57.3 kJ (per mole of H+), so 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I should think about the total heat released regardless of the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all H+ and OH- and the total heat from their neutralization, which is 0.2 moles, so 11.46 kJ.

But the only option close to that in kJ is D) -16.0 kJ. Hmm, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the H+ and OH- again.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

They neutralize to form 0.2 H2O, releasing 0.2 *57.3 kJ =11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, but there's no such option. The closest is option D) -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the moles.

HCl: 500 mL 0.2 M → 0.5 L *0.2 =0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL 0.3 M → 0.3 L *0.3=0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL 0.5 M →0.2 L *0.5=0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So that's correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O. So 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, which would be about -2.72 kcal (as in option A), but why?

Because 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.736 kcal, which is close to option A) -2.72 kcal.

So perhaps the question expects the enthalpy to be calculated in kcal rather than kJ, which would make option A the correct answer.

But then, why is option D present as -16.0 kJ? Maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and calculates the heat based on that, but in this case, the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 first. Let me think about the heat released in that reaction.

Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 reaction:

Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The ΔH for this reaction is typically around -242 kJ per mole of Ba(OH)2 (I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but let's say it's a known value). Alternatively, since each mole of H2O formation releases 57.3 kJ, and two moles are formed, the ΔH would be 2*57.3 = 114.6 kJ per mole of reaction. Wait, but the reaction is exothermic, so it's -114.6 kJ per mole.

Wait, but in this case, the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 and 0.1 respectively. So the limiting reagent is H2SO4 (0.09 moles), so the reaction would proceed for 0.09 moles.

So the heat released would be 0.09 * (-242 kJ) = approx -21.78 kJ.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact enthalpy change for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation to be done using the neutralization enthalpy per mole of H+.

But this approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not sure about the exact values.

Given the options and the calculations I did earlier, the enthalpy change should be around -11.46 kJ, which is not an option. But if I convert that into kcal, I get approximately -2.73 kcal, which is very close to option A) -2.72 kcal.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, it contributes \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base, diprotic):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in fewer moles. All \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) unreacted.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for \( 1 \, \text{mole of H⁺} + 1 \, \text{mole of OH⁻} \to 1 \, \text{mole of H₂O} \) is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ and OH⁻} \) react, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Convert to kcal (if required):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) is closest to the calculated value in kcal.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is significantly higher than the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) and does not match.  
   - Other options (B and C) are also inconsistent with the calculations.

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization for the given reaction is approximately \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
