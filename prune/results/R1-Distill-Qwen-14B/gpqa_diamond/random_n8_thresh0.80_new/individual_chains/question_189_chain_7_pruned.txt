Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's settled into a particular state. So particles that arise from such a breaking are called 'Goldstone bosons', right?

Wait, but wait. Goldstone's theorem says that for continuous symmetries broken spontaneously, massless bosons called Goldstone bosons appear. But if the symmetry is broken in a way that's not exact, or if there's a Higgs mechanism involved, things might differ. 

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. They arise from the vibrational modes of atoms in the lattice. But do they come from spontaneous symmetry breaking? Well, in a perfect crystal, the translational symmetry is unbroken. But when phonons are considered, maybe they're related to the breaking of some symmetry... Or perhaps not. Wait, phonons are more about the vibrational modes and the lattice's periodic structure. The periodicity comes from the crystal structure, which breaks translational symmetry. So perhaps phonons aren't directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way as, say, pions.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic systems. They arise due to the arrangement of magnetic moments in a way that minimizes energy but doesn't break the overall symmetry of the system completely. Wait, no, Skyrmions can emerge from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of pionic physics or in some magnetic materials. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think they are associated with broken symmetry because they represent a stable configuration in the system.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a crystal lattice's magnetic structure. These arise when the system has magnetic order, like in a ferromagnet. The original symmetry might be broken, for example, if the material goes from a paramagnetic state (no net magnetization) to a ferromagnetic state (net magnetization). So magnons could be Goldstone bosons of that symmetry breaking. Because when the magnetization points in a particular direction, the rotational symmetry is broken, and the Goldstone bosons (magnons
