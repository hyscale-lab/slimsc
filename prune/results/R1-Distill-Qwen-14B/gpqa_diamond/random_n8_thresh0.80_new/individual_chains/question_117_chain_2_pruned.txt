Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. So, the compounds must have some kind of asymmetry, like a carbon with four different groups attached.

The question lists four moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining some of them. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, biphenyl rings. So the structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but the substituents are nitro groups and methyl esters of carboxylic acids. Since the rings are connected by a single bond, the rotation around that bond can create different isomers. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, like if the groups are arranged such that each ring has different substituents in a way that makes the whole molecule asymmetric.

Wait, but biphenyls can have something called meso compounds or not. Wait, if the substituents are symmetrical, then maybe not. Let me think. If the two rings each have a nitro and a carbamate group, but in positions that are mirror images, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. Or maybe not. For example, in 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. Wait, but the positions are 2 and 2' on each ring. So the substituents are in ortho positions relative to the connecting bond. Hmmm, so if you have two rings each with two substituents on opposite sides, maybe the molecule is not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical if the substituents are mirrored. Like, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it not chiral. I'm a bit stuck on this one. Maybe I should come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this. Propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but the 2 position is the middle carbon. So the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the CH2 next to the COO group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is three carbons: the first is CH3, the second is CH(OH), the third is COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. If it's 2-hydroxy, the OH is on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, maybe the structure is:

O
|
CH2-C-O
    | 
    OCH3
    |
    CH2-OH

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: C(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (carbon 1 and 3). Wait, wait, no. Carbon 2 is connected to CH3, OH, the COOCH3 group, and the
