Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

So, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I have to make sure my units are consistent.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization typically refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But here, there are multiple acids and a base. So I guess I need to figure out how much each acid contributes and how much the base can neutralize them.

First, I should probably find out the moles of H+ ions from each acid and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, see if they neutralize each other completely or not. Oh right, because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So the moles of HCl are:

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So the moles of H2SO4 are:

0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait a second. But wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it might not fully dissociate both protons. But since it's a strong acid, I think both H+ ions are released. So yes, 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2, right? So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are:

0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, let me make sure. Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. Yes, so 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH-:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here would be OH- because there's less OH- than H+ (0.28 vs 0.2). So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the neutralization as the OH- being neutralized by the available H+.

So the reaction will proceed until either the H+ or OH- is all used up. Since OH- is 0.2 and H+ is 0.28, OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait again.
