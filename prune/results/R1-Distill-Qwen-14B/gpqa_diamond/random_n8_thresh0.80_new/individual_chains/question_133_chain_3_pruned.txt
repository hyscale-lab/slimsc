Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. 

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So the question is about finding the concentration of that ion. 

I remember that when you mix different phosphate salts, they can form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is the acid form, and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base, or vice versa? Let me think. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

So KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which is H2PO4^- and K^+. Whereas Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is HPO4^2- and Na+.

Wait, no, wait. No, Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate? Or maybe it's the disodium hydrogen phosphate. Let me get that right. 

Wait, when you have Na2HPO4, that's sodium hydrogen phosphate. So in solution, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So when you mix these two, you have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That must form a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So the buffer would be involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with the pH determined by
