Okay, so I need to solve this question about a ligand-receptor pair and their expression in a mouse model. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with specific structural features. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can be used to express a second gene without a polyA signal, perhaps for co-expression.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. Cre will recognize loxP and the FLP recombinase uses lox2272. But wait, in this case, they used a Cre vector. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette in the first part, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But wait, the vector is a bicistronic one, so I think the idea is that Cre would remove the stop cassettes to allow expression of both ligand-receptor.

Wait, no. Let me think: in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is at the end, preceded by a stop cassette (lox2272). So perhaps the setup is that when Cre is introduced, it will cut the loxP sites, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. But I'm not entirely sure how the IRES and the other elements are arranged.

They transfected primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They ran a Western blot and saw a signal proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor important in the development of the neural crest. SOX10-Cre would mean that the Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10, so it's active in neural crest-derived cells. So the idea is that in the offspring, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But after the offspring are born, they looked under a confocal microscope for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they didn't see any. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the receptor-eGFP construct. If they're in paracrine, the ligand is secreted and acts on nearby cells. But the issue here is that the eGFP isn't showing up, so maybe the receptor isn't getting expressed, which could be due to other reasons. Not sure if this is the main issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the GFP isn't getting to the cell surface or is retained. But the antibodies were used in Western blot, which detects total proteins. So if the GFP is stuck in the Golgi, it would still be present in the cell, and the Western blot might detect it. Unless it's not translated. But the Western blot was done on transfected cells, so maybe that's okay. But the problem is in the mouse model, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the construct isn't properly processed.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for ligand, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So perhaps the ligand is being expressed, but without an enhancer, the receptor might not be properly expressed. But the IRES is used for the receptor. IRES elements allow for expression without a strong promoter, but perhaps the CBA promoter only drives the ligand, and the receptor relies on the IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor may not be expressed. But wait, the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed in transfected cells. So perhaps in the mouse model, the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, in the mouse model, the Cre is SOX10-driven. So in neural crest cells, Cre is active. So the Cre should recombine the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But the GFP isn't showing up. Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't properly excised. So if the Cre didn't work, the eGFP would be under the stop cassette and not expressed.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. Let me think about the structure again. The vector is ligand (CBA promoter) -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no, perhaps the vector is arranged as CBA promoter driving ligand, then stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. Then, after the ligand, there's an IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. The question says: the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry, with a stop in loxP cassette in between. The receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus, and a stop in lox2272 cassette upstream.

So the vector is ligand (CBA promoter) --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry; then IRES --> receptor --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would not be expressed because the stop cassette is in place. Similarly, the receptor would not be expressed because the stop cassette after it is also in
