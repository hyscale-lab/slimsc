Okay, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me break down the reactions step by step to identify what each compound might be.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red products often make me think of something like a transition metal compound, maybe something with iron or chromium. Oh wait, when I think of red compounds, MnO2 is dark brown, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a product involving sulfur? Or perhaps a metal oxide?

Wait, another thought: when a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, in high ratios, maybe it's a metal chloride. For example, if A is iron, and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would be a lot. Iron typically forms FeCl2 or FeCl3. FeCl3 is a yellowish solution, but maybe when in solid form, it's different. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with O2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C is involved in other reactions. Let me look at the next part. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced when C reacts with D. Also, C reacts with water to give back A, and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak one.

If C reacting with water gives A, F, and G, perhaps C is a salt that hydrolyzes. Let's think: if C is a metal chloride, say FeCl3, then reacting with water would hydrolyze it. Wait, FeCl3 hydrolyzes in water to form Fe(OH)3 and HCl. But HCl is a strong acid, and Fe(OH)3 is a weak base (so maybe producing H+ and OH-). Wait, but in the question, it says two different acids. Oh, so maybe C is a salt that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or another compound.

Alternatively, think about the reaction: solid A + 8 B â†’ C. Since B is a gas, perhaps it's O2, but 8 moles per mole of A? That's a lot. Maybe A is aluminum reacting with O2. But Al usually reacts with O2 to form Al2O3, which is a white solid. Not red.

Wait, what about the reaction of
