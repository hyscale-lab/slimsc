Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about calculating the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a state that's an eigenstate of P_x. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩².

But wait, wait. To compute this, I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state. So, let's remember how to calculate expectation values with matrices.

The expectation value ⟨A⟩ for an operator A in state |ψ⟩ is ψ† A ψ, where ψ is a column vector and A is the matrix representation of the operator. So, I'll need to compute ψ† multiplied by the P_z matrix, multiplied by ψ again.

Looking at the given matrices:

P_z is given as:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me write that as a column vector.

So, first, I'll compute ⟨P_z⟩.

⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues, and the state is a linear combination of the basis vectors (which are the eigenvectors of P_z).

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each component in the state corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Therefore, the expectation value is just the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Let me think. The state is ψ = a|eigenstate_1> + b|eigenstate_2> + c|eigenstate_3>, where |eigenstate_i> are the basis vectors (eigenstates of P_z). So, the probability of each state is |a|², |b|², |c|².

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be |a|² * (ħ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ).

Given ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, the amplitudes are a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

Compute |a|²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, (-1/2)^2 is 1/4.

Similarly, |b|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * (-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements.

So, P_z² would be:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ] = [ [ ħ^2, 0, 0 ], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ^2 ] ]

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, the same approach applies.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|² * ħ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ħ².

Plugging in the values:

= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, now compute ΔP_z.

ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2 )

Since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ( ħ / sqrt(2) ) ).

Wait, sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) is ħ / sqrt(2), right?

So that would give an uncertainty of ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes, especially with expectation values, I might have made a mistake.

Let me recompute ⟨P_z²⟩.

Each term is |component|^2 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element squared.

So for the first component, (-1/2)^2 * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ².

Third component, (-1/2)^2 * (ħ)^2 = same as first, 1/4 ħ².

So sum is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, multiplied by ħ². So yes, 1/2 ħ².

And ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so ⟨P_z⟩^2 is zero.

Thus, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

But wait, the options given are:

A) sqrt(2) ħ

B) ħ / sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So correct answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The given state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
