Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem talks about several reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E.

First, let's list out all the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start by trying to identify each compound.

Looking at reaction 4: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something like acetone or DMSO. But the reaction between D and B forms H. Let's think about common 1:1 reactions.

Wait, D and B making H as a solvent. If B is a gas, maybe B is a halogen like Cl2 or Br2? Or perhaps something else. Let's think about D. If D is, say, H2O, but D is a gas. So, water is a liquid at room temp, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas. Alternatively, D could be something like NH3, which is a gas but can form a solvent when reacted with another gas.

Wait, another thought. If D is O2, but O2 is a diatomic gas and reacting with B. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, but then what would B be?

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak. What commonly produces two acids upon hydrolysis?

Wait a second, maybe C is a sulfide, but that might not fit. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfide which upon hydrolysis gives H2S (a weak acid) and maybe something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, think about nitrides. For example, NH3 reacting with water gives NH4OH (which is weak, but F is strong and G is weak). No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: bright red product C. What's a bright red compound? Maybe it's something like silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, but that's dark. Or perhaps it's a nitro compound? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound with a red color.

Wait, let's think about reaction 1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B. 8 equivalents is a lot, so perhaps it's a reaction where each A takes 8 B molecules. So if A is a metal, maybe a +2 or +3 charge, but 8 B would mean 8 anions? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halide. Oh, wait, another thought: if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl
