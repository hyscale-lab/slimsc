Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the mass might not directly affect the ratio, so maybe I can focus on the abundance data provided.

The given data uses the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a technique used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption. So, the [X/Y] notation is for logarithmic abundance ratios.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by 0.3 dex compared to the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Mg to Si is higher by 0.3.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance same as Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2] ?

But how? I think I need to find the abundance of Si in each star and then take the ratio.

Let me break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:
We know [Fe/H] is 0, meaning [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance same as Sun. So, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) = 0.3? Wait, no, wait. The notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, correct definition: [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nSi_sun is... Hmm, wait, the Sun's composition
