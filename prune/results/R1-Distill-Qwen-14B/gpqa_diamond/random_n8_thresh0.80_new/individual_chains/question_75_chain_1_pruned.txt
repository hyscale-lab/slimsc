Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's start by looking at the problem.

The researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. So, something's wrong with the construct.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I should examine it for any issues that would prevent proper translation or expression.

First, I'll check the reading frame. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon should be right after the tag. The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the methionine start codon. That looks correct.

Wait, let me look for any stop codons in the sequence. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA. If there's an early stop codon, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Looking through the sequence:

Breaking it into triplets from the start:
ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC... (Hmm, wait, wait. Let me write it more carefully.)

Wait, the sequence is:

Wait, perhaps I should check the entire sequence for the presence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Let me scan for TGA:

Looking for T-G-A triplets. Scanning the letters:

Looking through the sequence...

Wait, the very end is ...GAGTGA3'. So the last part is GAG TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Ah, that's a problem! So the coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, but the construct ends with TGA, which will cause the ribosome to stop before the end of the protein. So the protein would be truncated, or not made at all, because the ribosome stops early.

Wait, but wait. The provided sequence is the plus strand. So the coding sequence is plus, which would be the same as the mRNA, except mRNA is made from the template strand, which is complementary.

Wait, no. Wait, DNA has two strands, the coding strand (same as mRNA) and the template strand. The plus strand is the coding strand, so the sequence provided is the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, which is the reverse complement of the plus strand.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So the provided sequence is the sense strand, which would code for the protein.

So the sequence starts with ATG (start codon) and ends with ...GAGTGA, which is GAG and then TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the construct includes a stop codon in the middle? No, wait.

Wait, the end of the DNA sequence is ...GAGTGA3'. So the last three nucleotides are T G A. Which is the stop codon. So the DNA sequence ends with TGA, which in the mRNA would be UAG, another stop codon.

Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is double-stranded. The mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template strand. So the provided plus strand is the same as the mRNA. So the last part of the mRNA would be ...GAG UGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early, at UGA, which is a stop codon.

That's the problem. The construct includes a stop codon in the middle, causing the ribosome to stop before the end of the protein. So the protein isn't expressed, or is expressed as a truncated version.

Wait, but why did the stop codon get included? Because when you're designing a construct, you typically avoid internal stop codons. In this case, perhaps the cloning introduced a stop codon.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA tag's sequence is messed up, that could affect expression. The HA tag is a short peptide, so if there's a mutation in the HA sequence, maybe the protein doesn't fold or isn't recognized for purification. But the issue here is the stop codon, not the HA tag. So A might not be the cause here.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That's exactly what's happening. The stop codon causes early termination. So B seems correct, but let me check the other options.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence is usually added to separate the tag from the protein to prevent proteolysis. But if the stop codon is causing the protein to be truncated, this might not be the issue. Unless the HA tag is causing proteolysis, but the question
