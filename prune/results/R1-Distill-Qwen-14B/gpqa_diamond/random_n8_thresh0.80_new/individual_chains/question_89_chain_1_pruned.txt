Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. 

First, the first reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two bromines not adjacent. Oh wait, no, let me think. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure where each carbon is connected to three others. So 1 and 3 are adjacent? No, because in the structure, each carbon in adamantane is connected to three others, with a four-membered ring structure. So 1 and 3 are probably not adjacent. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead is a carbon attached to three others. So, the structure of adamantane is like two cyclohexane rings bridged in a chair-like structure. So, 1 and 3 would be bridgehead carbons that are opposite each other, I think. So, heating with KOH would cause elimination. Since KOH is a strong base, it would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, wait. Wait, if the two bromines are on the same carbon, it's a vicinal dihalide, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which are non-adjacent carbons. So perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from each Br, leading to a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, each Br is on a bridgehead. So, when KOH is used, perhaps it leads to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? No, perhaps it's a dielimination. Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two
