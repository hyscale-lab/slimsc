Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, isn't that used for the hydrolysis of esters or something? Or maybe it's a way to cleave certain functional groups.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data provided. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400-2500 cm-1, which suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an alkyne (C-H stretch). The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. So, that suggests an aromatic ring is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift. For aromatic protons, that seems a bit high. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a broad singlet might suggest an exchange, like an -OH group. But if the IR has the 3400-2500 region, which is typical for -OH, but wait, the 1720 is more prominent. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because their O-H stretch is very strong and broad, like in the 2500-3000 region. Wait, but the IR given also shows a 3400â€“2500, which is a broad range, so maybe a carboxylic acid.

But let's look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, maybe an aldehyde? Or perhaps an acidic proton like -COOH. Let's think: if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak would be broad due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the IR 1720 might suggest a carbonyl, like an ester.

Wait, in the NMR, after the 10.5, there are two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm with 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So, maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic compound, like p-xylene or something with substituents in the para positions.

Then, the next peaks: 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Let's break this down. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) likely indicates a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group between two other groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent might be a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720), and another substituent could be a branched alkyl chain.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl. So could it be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid? But the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm could indicate an aldehyde proton (but aldehydes typically have sharp peaks around 9-10 ppm, unless it's a conjugated aldehyde which might be a bit upfield). Alternatively, the 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid. But the IR also shows strong absorption in the 3400-2500 region, which is more consistent with an -OH group than an aldehyde. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: if the IR has a strong peak at 1720, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1730-1750 cm-1. Wait, but 1720 is a bit lower. Could that be a ketone? No, because 1720 is more ester or maybe acid. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but it can vary. Also, the broad peak in IR around 2500-3000 could be O-H of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is more indicative of an aldehyde. Because aldehydes typically are around 9-10 ppm, and they appear as a singlet if they're not split by any neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, but phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's an aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups which can cause upfield shifts. Hmm, but 10.5 is quite high for a phenol.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Let's think: The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5, which could be the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, suggesting a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with another substituent.

Wait, but then where are the other signals in the NMR? The 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest an ethyl group attached to a branched structure.

Putting this all together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other is a branched alkyl chain. Alternatively, it could be an ester group (for the carbonyl) attached to a benzene ring, with another substituent.

Wait, let me try to draw this. So, if we have a para-substituted benzene, one substituent is a carbonyl group (maybe -COOR, but wait, the IR doesn't show a strong O-H for an ester, but 1720 is a carbonyl). Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but ketones don't have an O-H. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300 cm-1, which matches. So that would support the presence of a carboxylic acid.
