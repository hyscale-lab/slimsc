Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. They give me some options, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which means it's a 1:1 ratio, right? So the formula would be something like CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA part. The problem states it's a stochiometric solution, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

The K for the complex formation is given as 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, Kf. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in various protonated forms because EDTA is a polydentate ligand and has multiple protons. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal. Oh right, because EDTA's ability to form complexes depends on the pH. So if the pH is ideal, I probably don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA; the solution is buffered such that the concentration of free EDTA^4- is sufficient for complex formation. So I can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+.

So the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

Now, considering the stoichiometry, the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per formula unit. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then in pure solution without considering dissociation, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be 0.02 M. But wait, because the complex can dissociate, the actual concentrations will be lower.

Wait, no, because Kf
