Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take a while.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in a state that's an eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, right?

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero or anything like that. I'll have to compute the expectation values explicitly.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's write that as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]. I'll need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, but what's the matrix for P_z? Oh right, it's given. The matrix for P_z is diagonal because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. The matrix looks like this:

P_z = [[ℏ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ℏ]]

So the diagonal entries are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, any state in this basis will have certain components corresponding to the eigenvalues. Let me think, the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in terms of these basis vectors. Oh wait, but is that the case here? Let me check the state vector.

The state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. So in the P_z eigenbasis, the components are c1 = -1/2, c2=1/sqrt(2), c3=-1/2.

Wait, but the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩, right? Because P_z has eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So |+z⟩ is (
