Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, leading to D. I need to figure out what D is based on the given options.

First, let's look at the information given about compound A. The proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others. So the 0.9 ppm triplet for 6H—what has six protons like that? Maybe a (CH2CH3) group because each CH3 would couple with two adjacent protons. Wait, no, wait: each triplet in this context could be two sets of CH3 groups. For example, two CH2CH3 groups would give a triplet for the CH3 because each is next to the CH2. But wait, 6H in a triplet—so maybe two sets of three CH3 groups? Or perhaps each of two CH2CH3 groups contributes 3H each, but that would be 6H in total. Oh wait, no, each CH2CH3 has 3H, so two of them would be 6H. So the triplet comes from the CH3 groups attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is 6H: that's probably two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Or maybe three CH3 groups? Wait, no, because each CH3 in a triplet would come from the coupling with two adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the triplet is from a (CH2CH2) arrangement? Hmm, maybe it's a diethyl group. Diethyl ether, maybe? Because in diethyl ether, you have two CH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be a triplet because each is adjacent to the CH2. Let me confirm that: in diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are split by the adjacent CH2, so each CH3 would be a triplet. And each CH2 in the middle would be a quartet because each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and the CH3.

Wait, the NMR of compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). So perhaps the quartet comes from the CH2 groups. Let me think: in diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The CH3 groups are each attached to a CH2. So each CH3 would have three H, and when you have two of them, you get 6H as a triplet. The quartet comes from the CH2 groups next to the CH3. Each CH2 has two H, and since each is next to another CH2 (with two H), each would split into a quartet. Wait, but how many H are in the quartet? Each CH2 in diethyl ether has two H, so two CH2 groups would give 4H in total at 1.3 ppm as a quartet. That fits with what's given for compound A. So compound A is diethyl ether. Wait, but diethyl ether's structure is (CH2CH3)
