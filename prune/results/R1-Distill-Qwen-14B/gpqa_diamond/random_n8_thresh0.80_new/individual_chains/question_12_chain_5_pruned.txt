Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember pions are subatomic particles, right? The question is asking about the kinetic energy of the product particles. The given equation is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu, which is a neutrino I guess. And the pion is stationary initially.

So, the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost zero. Or do I consider their rest mass here? Hmm, I think in this problem, since the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, we can ignore it. Or maybe the problem assumes it's massless.

The problem is about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite to each other. Because momentum has to be conserved.

But wait, the muon has a rest mass, and the neutrino doesn't. Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy after decay should be equal to the rest energy of the pion because the pion is at rest. So the total energy is just m_pi c squared, which is 139.6 MeV. Because initially, the pion's kinetic energy is zero.

So, the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should be 139.6 MeV. But the neutrino's energy is related to its momentum. And the muon's energy would be its rest mass plus kinetic energy, right?

Wait, maybe I should set up some equations. Let me denote E_mu as the total energy of the muon (including rest mass and kinetic), and E_nu as the neutrino's energy, which is just pc since its mass is negligible.

Because momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) equals the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). But wait, since the muon has mass, its momentum is p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v, and energy is gamma * m_mu c². The neutrino's energy is p_nu c.

So let's write the energy conservation equation:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

And since momentum is
