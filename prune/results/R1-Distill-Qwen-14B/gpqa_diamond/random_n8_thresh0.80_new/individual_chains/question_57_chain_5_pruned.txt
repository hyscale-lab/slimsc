Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the given phase shifts are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1 = 67 degrees, delta_2 = 55 degrees, delta_3 = 30 degrees, and delta_4 = 13 degrees. They also mention to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these provided phase shifts.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is calculated using a sum over all angular momentum states. Each term involves the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. The formula I think is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * Pl(cosθ) ]

Where k is the wave number, l is the angular momentum quantum number, δ_l is the phase shift for that l. The imaginary part would come from the sine part, right?

So the imaginary part Im(f) is given by:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) sin(δ_l) * Pl(1) ]

Because when θ is 0 degrees (along the incident beam), cosθ is 1, so Pl(1) is 1 for all l. That simplifies things because each term just contributes (2l+1) sin(delta_l) multiplied by 1.

So Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l + 1) sin(delta_l)

Wait, but what's k? The wave number k is given by (sqrt(2mE))/ħ, but I think in these units, they might have used some conversion. Alternatively, since the energy is given in MeV, perhaps I need to calculate k in terms of inverse femtometers or something. Let me see... Oh wait, I think the relation between the energy and the wave number for electrons is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but I might need to use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for k in terms of the Debye wavelength? Or perhaps use the relativistic expression for the electron's momentum. At 50 MeV, electrons are relativistic. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so we can treat it as ultra-relativistic. The momentum p would be sqrt(E^2 - m^2c^4)/(c), but perhaps in natural units where c=1, the momentum p is sqrt(E^2 - m^2) ≈ E since E >> m.

Wait, but for non-relativistic, k is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but for relativistic, k is sqrt( (E^2)/(ħ^2 c^2) - (m^2 c^4)/(ħ^2 c^2) ) ) * ħ c. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of units.

The wave number k has units of inverse length. The energy E is given in MeV. So maybe I can calculate k using the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ) for non-relativistic, but wait, for electrons, when E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c² (which is about 0.511 MeV), so they are ultra-relativistic. So the expression for k would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem provides a way to calculate k. Let me think: The relation between the momentum p and the wave number k. For an electron, p = ħ k. And relativistically, E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². So since E is 50 MeV, p c is sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2) ≈ E, because m c² is negligible compared to E. So p ≈ E/(c), and
