Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with product 3. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Alright, let's break down each step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR data given for product 1 is 1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons of adamantane. Heating with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction. But since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an E2 mechanism, causing the loss of HBr. But with two bromines, maybe two eliminations happen? Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure: adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent, so when KOH is used, each Br might be removed, leading to the formation of a double bond. So perhaps it forms an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. When dibromides react with strong bases, they can form alkenes via elimination. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? The adamantane structure has each carbon in a certain position, so removing two Br's would form a double bond.

Wait, but the product has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl, maybe an ester. Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't dehydrohalogenation but a substitution.

Wait, wait. KOH is a strong base, but sometimes when two leaving groups are present, especially vicinal dihalides, elimination can form an alkene. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated diene? Maybe that's what's happening here.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more indicative of an ester (like around 1740-1720) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, but epoxide formation usually involves peracids. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps a double substitution occurs, leading to an oxide or something else.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps the Br atoms leave as Br⁻, and the hydroxide attacks. But with two leaving groups, maybe a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a ketone. How? Let me think: each elimination forms a double bond, but two eliminations could form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't see how that would give the IR peak mentioned.

Wait, another angle. The initial product's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high chemical shift, possibly an -OCH₂- group, maybe an ether or ester. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests some CH₂ groups in a more shield
