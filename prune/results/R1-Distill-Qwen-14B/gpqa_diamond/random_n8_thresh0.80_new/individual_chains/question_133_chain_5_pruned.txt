Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL or 0.2 L) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. KH2PO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and Na2HPO4 is the hydrogen phosphate. So these two are adjacent in the phosphate ion series.

Wait, so when you have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, they're going to form a buffer solution. Because buffer solutions involve a weak acid and its conjugate base. In this case, I think KH2PO4 is the acid (since it can donate a proton) and Na2HPO4 is the base (since it can accept a proton).

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? But wait, in solution, these can deprotonate further, but given the Ka values, which ones are more prevalent?

The dissociation steps for H3PO4 are:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Since the given salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they're in solution as H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the solution would have both these ions, as well as their possible deprotonation products.

But wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is formed from the deprotonation of HPO4^2- (the third dissociation step). So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the solution's pH and the various Ka values.

But how do I find the concentration considering both salts contribute to the phosphate species?

I think the key here is to write the expression for the third dissociation (since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton). So, the equilibrium would be:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka3 for this step is 1.8e-12. So, the equilibrium constant expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

But wait, I need to find [PO4^3-]. So rearranging,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Hmm, but I don't know the pH of the solution. So I need to find [H+] somehow. Alternatively, maybe the solution's pH is determined by the buffer system, which is the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. That equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

Where HA is H2PO4^- and A- is HPO4^2-.

So I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution first.

Let's calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: mass = 1.00 g, Mw=136.09 g/mol.
Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol. Since it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass =1.00 g, Mw=177.99 g/mol.
Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol. It dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and two H2O. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L.

So the concentration of H2
