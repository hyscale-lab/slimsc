Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The question gives the volumes and concentrations, and asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so that's mixing equal volumes of acid and water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. So the first value is the pH at 25% titration, the second at equivalence.

First, I think I should find out the initial concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is (0.02 L * 0.05 M ) / 0.04 L = (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, no: M = moles/volume. So initial moles of acetic acid is 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Diluted into 0.04 L, so new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes.

So the solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the equivalence point volume.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH is being added to reach equivalence. So at equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution because NaOH (a strong base) reacts with acetic acid to produce sodium acetate and water. So at equivalence, I have a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

But wait, how do I find the pH at equivalence and at 25% titration?

First, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the way to equivalence means 25% of the NaOH
