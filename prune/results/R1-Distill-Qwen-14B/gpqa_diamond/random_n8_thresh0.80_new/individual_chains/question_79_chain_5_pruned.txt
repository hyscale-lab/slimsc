Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I think that's a specific reaction condition. Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, maybe used in some elimination or ring-opening reaction. But wait, Compound X is C11H12O, and the product's NMR is given. So the reaction probably forms an epoxide or something similar.

Looking at the 1H NMR data of the product. The peaks are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups. Singlet means no neighboring protons. So maybe two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't allow splitting.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). These are aromatic protons. Let me see, the doublets suggest they're part of a coupling system. Wait, the H at 6.75 is a d, and 7.08 is 2H d. Similarly, 7.68 is d and 7.71 is 2H d. That might be a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted system, you typically have two sets of doublets. Alternatively, it could be a substituent that causes coupling in a certain pattern.

In the 13C NMR, we have signals at 21.3 and 28.4, each a singlet, so those are likely the two methyl groups we saw in the 1H NMR. Then, the rest are in the aromatic region. Let's see: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). Wait, but that's 8 carbons in the aromatic region, but the molecular formula of the product isn’t given. Wait, the original compound X is C11H12O. Let's see, after reaction, what would the formula be? The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps an elimination or ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, but the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe an SN2 or something else. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh, maybe it's used in an epoxidation? Or perhaps an elimination to form a double bond. Alternatively, if X is an epoxide, maybe the reaction is ring-opening. Hmm.

Wait, Compound X is C11H12O. Let's think about the options. The options are
