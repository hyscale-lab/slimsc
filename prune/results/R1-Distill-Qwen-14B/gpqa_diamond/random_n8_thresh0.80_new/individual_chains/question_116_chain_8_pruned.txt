Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR and reaction mechanisms.

Alright, the question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring Hs, and a quartet means three neighbors. Also, the chemical shifts can hint at the structure—like, 0.9 ppm is probably a methyl group next to something, maybe an oxygen or part of a ring. But wait, 1.3 ppm is a bit upfield, maybe part of an ethyl group or something branched.

So, thinking about the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. 6 hydrogens in a triplet... that's probably two methyl groups each with three H. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—4 H in a quartet. That could be an ethyl group, maybe CH2CH2 something. Wait, but 1.3 is a bit low for an ethyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's part of a cyclohexane system? Like, perhaps the ethyl group is attached to a ring.

Putting this together, maybe Compound A is cyclohexane with some substituents. Let me think: if the cyclohexane has two methyl groups and another substituent, perhaps. Wait, the triplet and quartet might be from adjacent groups. Let's imagine a structure where a methyl group is next to a CH2 group.

Wait, wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two equivalent methyl groups. Like, maybe two isopropyl groups? No, wait, isopropyl would have more Hs. Alternatively, perhaps two methyl groups each next to a CH2. So maybe the structure is like (CH3)2CHCH2 something... but not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something. But wait, diethyl would have more hydrogens. Let me think again: 6H as a triplet. Two methyl groups (each 3H) would make 6H. So each methyl is attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2. Because the quartet is 4H—so that quartet comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2.

Oh! I think I remember that when you have a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3, the NMR would show certain splits. Wait, but maybe in a cyclic structure. Like, perhaps cyclopropane? No, probably more likely cyclohexane.

Wait, another approach: when a CH2 group is next to another CH2, each would split into a quartet or triplet. Wait, if you have two CH2 groups in a row, like CH2-CH2, each group would have neighboring Hs. Let me think: the first CH2 would be next to the second CH2, which has two Hs. So each CH2 would split into a triplet. But in this case, the quartet is 4H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 group. Because a CH2 next to a CH3 would have each H on the CH2 seeing three Hs from the CH3. So the quartet would be for the CH2 group. So the quartet (4H) is from CH2, and the triplet (6H) is from two CH3 groups attached to that CH2.

Wait, so the structure could be something like (CH3)2CHCH2... but where? Oh wait, maybe it's part of a cyclohexane ring. Like, the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane with two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. No, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit that. Let me try another approach.

Another possibility: the triplet is from two methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure
