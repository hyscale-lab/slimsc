Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), but one is the R configuration and the other is S. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the first product is (R)-4-ethyl... and the second is (S)-4-ethyl... So, each reaction produces the same compound but with opposite configurations.

The question is asking us to select the proper starting materials A and B from the given options. The options are four possibilities, each giving A and B as either S or R configurations of the same compound.

So, I remember that when you reduce a ketone to form an alcohol, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent and the conditions. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an epoxide or a cyclic ether, but no, the product is a ketone. Wait, no, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. Oh, pyranone is a cyclic ketone. So, wait, how do you form that?

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me visualize that structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone group at position 2. The ring is fully saturated because it's tetrahydro. So, positions 4 is ethyl. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with oxygen, fully saturated, with a ketone at C2 and an ethyl group at C4.

Now, the starting materials A and B are treated with two different reducing agents: one uses LiBH4 and H+ (maybe an acid?), and the other uses BH3 and H+. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Hmm, wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, or maybe they are cyclic esters or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Wait, LiBH4 is used in the reduction of ketals to alcohols. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reagents. Or perhaps the starting materials are epox
