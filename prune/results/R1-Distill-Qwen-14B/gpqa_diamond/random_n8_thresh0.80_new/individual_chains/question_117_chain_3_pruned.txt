Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, if a molecule has at least one chiral center, it can show optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, this looks a bit complex. It's a biphenyl compound, so two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' on the other positions. The nitro groups and the ester groups are attached as substituents. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but conformational changes don't usually lead to stereoisomerism. But wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. Let me think about the structure. The substituents are at 2 and 2', which are ortho positions on each ring. Considering the two nitro groups on the 6,6' positions, which are para on each ring. So the molecule might have some symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, it might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can't be chiral unless there's a substituent causing it. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Or perhaps the biphenyl arrangement makes it so that any potential chiral centers are canceled out by symmetry? Not sure yet. Maybe I'll come back to this.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the carbon chain is CH2-C(OH)H-COOCH3, but wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COO- with a methyl ester. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The middle carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), carbonyl (COOCH3), and the adjacent CH3 from the CH3 group. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH(OH); the groups attached would be: CH3 (from the adjacent CH), OH, COOCH3, and the other adjacent CH? Wait, wait, let me think again. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to: a) CH3 (
