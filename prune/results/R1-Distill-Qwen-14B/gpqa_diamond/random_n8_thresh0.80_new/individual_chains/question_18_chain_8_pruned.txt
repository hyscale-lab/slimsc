Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But wait, the masses might not directly affect the elemental ratios, so maybe I can focus on the given abundance data.

The problem gives us some abundance ratios using the EW method. Let's list out what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than the Sun by 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon ratio is higher than the Sun by 0.3.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So magnesium to hydrogen is same as the Sun.

Wait, and the Sun's photosphere has specific values:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- Similarly for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait the given Sun's data: for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So that's log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait wait, wait. Let me recheck. The Sun's data says: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, and Star_1's [Fe/H] is zero. So Star_1 has same Fe abundance as the Sun relative to H. Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is zero, same as the Sun.

So, let's find the silicon abundance in each star, relative to H, and then find the ratio.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

We need to find nSi1/nH1.

But wait, since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n
