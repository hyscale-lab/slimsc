Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and NMR data. 

Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully. So, Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, both 1H and 13C. I need to figure out what Compound X is from the options.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Oh right, that's a type of catalyst, maybe for some kind of reaction. Or wait, no, wait. Oh, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base, often used in elimination reactions. Or perhaps it's a catalyst for an epoxide opening? Hmm, alternatively, wait, sometimes it's used in the formation of epoxides. No, wait, another thought: Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, and in such conditions, maybe it's involved in an elimination reaction. Or perhaps it's part of a ring-opening or a ring-closing process. Alternatively, maybe it's a method of deprotonation to form a double bond.

Wait, but looking at the product's NMR data. The product's molecular formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O. The reaction is with that compound, so the product would have a similar formula or maybe lose some atoms. Let me think about each of the options and what reaction they might undergo.

The options are A to D, and each is an epoxide. Wait, let me look at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all of these are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So, the product after reaction is an epoxide? Or is the starting material an epoxide that reacted? Hmm.

Wait, the question says Compound X is subjected to a reaction. So, what's the reaction of an epoxide under these conditions? Or perhaps the starting material is not an epoxide but forms one.

Wait, the reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K. Oh, wait, that's 150 degrees Celsius. So, high temperature. Also, the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe a solvent like toluene or something similar.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism. So, perhaps Compound X undergoes elimination to form an epoxide. Or maybe the starting material is something like an alcohol or a glycol which forms an epoxide under
