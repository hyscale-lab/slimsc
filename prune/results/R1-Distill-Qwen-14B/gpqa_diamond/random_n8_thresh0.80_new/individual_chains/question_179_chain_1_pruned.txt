Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z and asks which statement about them is correct, choosing from options A to D.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is a unitary matrix. Also, the exponential of an observable (times i) gives a unitary matrix, which is used for time evolution.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The norm changing under a matrix multiplication implies that the matrix isn't unitary. Because if a matrix is unitary, multiplying a vector by it preserves the norm. So if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by it would change the norm.

What's X? Let me look at X's entries. X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Wait, but wait. To find if e^X is unitary, perhaps we should first check if X is Hermitian. Because for e^X to be unitary, X must be Hermitian, right? Because for X Hermitian, e^{iX} is unitary. Wait, no—wait. Actually, if X is Hermitian, then e^{iX} is unitary, but e^X would not necessarily be unitary. Because the exponential of a Hermitian matrix is not unitary unless you multiply by i.

Wait, what's the deal with unitary matrices. A matrix U is unitary if U† U = I. So if X is Hermitian (X† = X), then e^{X} would not necessarily be unitary. But e^{iX} would be unitary because (e^{iX})† = e^{-i X} = (e^{iX})^{-1}.

But the question is about e^X. So if X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. So if e^X is not unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes.

So I think I need to check if X is Hermitian. Let me compute X†.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate transpose (X†) will have the rows as columns with complex conjugates.

X†:
Row 1: i*, 1, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Wait, X's first column is [i, 1, 2i]^T. So the first row of X† is [i*, 1*, (2i)*] → [-i, 1, -2i]

Wait, no, wait: X has first row [i, -1, 2i], so the first column of X is [i, 1, 2i], so the first row of X† is [i*, 1*, (2i)*] → [-i, 1, -2i].

Wait no, the first column of X is [i; 1; 2i], so the first row of X† is [i*, (1)*, (2i)*]. i* is -i, 1* is 1, 2i* is -2i.

Wait, but let me write out X† properly.

X is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write X as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† would be:

Column 1 of X becomes row 1 of X†, taking complex conjugates.

So Column 1 of X is [i, 1, 2i]^T. Conjugate each element: -i, 1*, -2i → [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Similarly, column 2 of X is [-1, 0, -1]^T → [ -1, 0, -1 ] → conjugate is same because real.

Column 3 of X is [2i, 1, -i]^T → conjugate is [ -2i, 1, i ]

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1 → no, wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me make sure.

Wait, each element in X is [i, -1
