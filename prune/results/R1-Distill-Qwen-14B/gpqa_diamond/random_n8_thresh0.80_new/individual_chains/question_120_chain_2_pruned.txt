Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the distribution of stars and how their number relates to parallax. Hmm, let's start by recalling what parallax is. Parallax is a measure of how much a star's position shifts in the sky as the Earth orbits the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, actually, no, wait—the closer a star is, the larger the parallax? Or is it the opposite? I think it's the opposite. Because if a star is nearby, the angle it moves when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit is bigger. So yeah, closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So there are the same number of stars per unit volume in all directions. But wait, how does that relate to parallax? Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

We're looking for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (N) changes with plx. So for a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Let me think about the volume. The number density of stars is uniform, so the number in a certain volume should be proportional to the volume. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

So, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, and the shell is the difference between r and r+dr, which approximates to 4π r² dr for small dr.

Since distance d is 1/plx, we can write d = 1/plx. So, let's express the volume in terms of plx.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. But wait, what's dd in terms of plx? Since d is 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can ignore the sign for now.

So, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Let me double-check that. Wait, dd is the change in distance. So dd = d (dplx). Since plx = 1/d, d (dplx
