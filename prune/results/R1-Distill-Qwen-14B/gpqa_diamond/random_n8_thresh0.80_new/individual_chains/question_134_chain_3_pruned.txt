Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some strong acids and a strong base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base. But wait, the question here seems a bit more complicated because there are three solutions involved. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the problem states that we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The question is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization of this mixture. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it and see which option fits.

First, I think I should figure out the moles of each reactant. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and this process releases heat. But wait, I need to consider how much H+ and OH- each substance contributes.

Let's start with each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-. The moles of HCl would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So, 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Therefore, 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

2. H2SO4: This is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. The reaction is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So, the moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. The moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So, that's 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, let's calculate the total H+ and OH- available.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the limiting reagent here will determine how much actually reacts.

So, comparing the moles:

H+ available: 0.28 mol.

OH- available: 0.2 mol.

So, the OH- is the limiting
