Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each Ca ion binds with one EDTA molecule.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. The given information includes the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this case, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the reaction is 1:1, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be 0, I think, because the complex is formed from them. But wait, when the complex dissociates, it would give back some Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So let me write the equilibrium expression. The complex concentration is 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociates, but since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is going to be really small. So we can probably approximate that [CaEDTA] is approximately 0.02 M, and the changes in [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are negligible compared to that.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because the formation is 1:1. So the expression for Kf is Kf = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = 5e10.

Putting the values in: 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x). So 5e10 = 0.02 / x². Rearranging this, x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e1
