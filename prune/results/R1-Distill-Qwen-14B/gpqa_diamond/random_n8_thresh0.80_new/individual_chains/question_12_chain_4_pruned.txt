Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see. The pion is at rest, and it decays into a muon plus a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, neutrinos are neutral, so they don't have charge, but that's probably not too important for this problem.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is stationary initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino after decay must cancel each other out. So their momenta have to be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) should be equal to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but opposite in direction. That's an important point.

Now, the next thing I need to consider is the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's at rest. So the energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The rest mass energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino, though, is a different case. I think neutrinos are considered to be nearly massless, especially in these kinds of problems. So its rest mass is negligible. So the neutrino's energy will be just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But since rest mass is almost zero, it's approximately equal to the kinetic energy.

Wait, let me think again. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy (K). So for each particle, E = K + mc². But for the neutrino, mc² is zero (approx), so E_nu = K_nu.

So for the muon, E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c². And neutrino's energy is just K_nu.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (K_mu + m_mu c²) + K_nu.

But before the decay, the energy is just the pion's rest energy, which is m_pi c². So:

m_pi c² = (K_mu + m_mu c²) + K_nu.

Also, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momentum vectors must add up to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes are the same, and directions opposite.

The magnitudes are |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, I can think about the energies in terms of their momenta. For each particle, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino, E_nu² = (p c)^2 (since m_nu is zero).

So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c²? Wait, actually,
