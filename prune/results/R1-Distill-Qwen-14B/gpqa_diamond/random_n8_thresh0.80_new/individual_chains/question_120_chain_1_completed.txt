Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular clustering. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to the first, second, third, or fourth power.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes (since they appear to move more against the background).

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density of stars is the same everywhere. But how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax? Let me think. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, when plx increases, the distance decreases. So, if I look at a range of parallaxes, the number of stars in each range depends on how that range translates to distance.

Wait, the number per unit plx... So, if I have a small change in plx, say dplx, how many stars are there in that interval. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of space that corresponds to that plx range.

But wait, volume in terms of distance. Let's model this. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd is proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², and thickness is dd. So the number of stars N is k * 4πd² dd, where k is the number density.

Now, since plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Then, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because if d increases, p decreases. So when plx increases by dp, d decreases. So the shell's thickness in distance is dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're looking at the number of stars, we'll take the absolute value.

So substituting d = 1/p into the expression for N: N = k * 4π (1/p^2)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, let me double-check. Wait, d is 1/p, so d squared is 1/p². And dd is (1/p²) dp. So plugging in:

N = k * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4πk (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So that's dN/dp.

But wait, the options are about how it changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. That's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with flux or other measures, the dependence is different. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, another approach: think about the volume between two spheres. The volume between d and d+dd is (4π/3)( (d+dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small dd, this is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd is proportional to d² dd.

But since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So substituting, d² = 1/p², and dd = (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 1/p^4 dp.

So dN/dp = (number per unit plx) = 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( p \) is parallax and \( d \) is distance. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness (\( dd \)).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), the surface area becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 = \frac{4\pi}{p^2} \), and the thickness \( dd \) becomes \( -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (taking the absolute value for the number of stars). The number of stars in the shell is then proportional to:

\[
N \propto \frac{4\pi}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \frac{dN}{dp} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( p \) increases, following the relation \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \).

From the given options:
- **A)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \) matches the derived relation.
- **B)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^2} \), **C)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p} \), and **D)** \( \sim \frac{1}{p^3} \) do not match the derived relation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
