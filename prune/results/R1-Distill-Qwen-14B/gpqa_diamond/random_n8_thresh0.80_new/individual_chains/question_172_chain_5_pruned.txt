Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on iron atoms in their photosphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with stars and their atmospheres, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is often used. LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is emitting and absorbing radiation as if it were in equilibrium with a blackbody at a certain temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 have twice as excited a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of different energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So, the ratio of the populations N_upper/N_lower is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Or wait, I think for two states, the ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two states. Oh wait, wait, I might be mixing up the signs. Let me think again. The higher energy state has higher energy, so the population should be lower. So the ratio N2/N1 = exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), yeah that's right.

In this problem, in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, let's say in star_1, the number of atoms in the higher energy level is N1, and in star_2, it's N2. The problem says N1 = 2 * N2. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around. Because if star_1's atoms are more excited, maybe they have more in the higher energy state? Or wait, the question states that the atoms are "twice as excited". Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, for a specific energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So that would mean that for that level, the population is higher in star_1.
