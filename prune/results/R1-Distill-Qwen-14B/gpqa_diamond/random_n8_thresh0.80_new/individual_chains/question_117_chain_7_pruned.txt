Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They can't be rotated or flipped to match, so they have different physical properties like how they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' position. So each phenyl group is attached to the central carbon. Now, looking at the substituents: nitro groups at the 6,6' positions and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. Wait, but the central structure is biphenyl. Do the substituents make this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are all in positions that are symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents are at positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule might not be chiral. Like, if the substituents are all on the same side or arranged symmetrically, no chiral centers. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe creating a chiral center. Hmm, wait, but biphenyl itself isn't chiral. Unless the substituents create a chiral center on the central carbon.

Wait, the central carbon is the point where the two phenyl rings are attached. So each phenyl is attached to that carbon. Each phenyl has substituents—like the nitro and carboxylate groups. But wait, in the case of 6,6' and 2,2' positions, are those positions symmetric across the central bond? Let me visualize it. So each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Since 2 and 6 are meta to each other on each ring. Wait, but if the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents could be either on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, but does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then a chiral center could exist. Alternatively, if the arrangement is symmetrical, then no.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if each substituent is mirrored on the other ring, then it's achiral. But if the arrangement is such that there's no symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps this compound is a case where the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule have a plane of symmetry. Because the two nitro groups are at 6,6' and the two COOCH3 groups are at 2,2'—so the molecule is symmetrical. So no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'll come back to this after looking at the others.

The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CH(OH)CO
