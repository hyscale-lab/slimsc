Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, often in the form of DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene), but wait, isn't this one a different bicyclic amine? Oh, maybe it's used in similar reactions, like acid-base reactions or elimination.

So the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR has signals at:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, two singlets each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups, probably attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like being attached to an oxygen or in a symmetrical position.

Then there are four aromatic signals. Let me think: two sets of doublets. The first is 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d). Maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring? And another triplet: 7.68 (1H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, that's 1H and 2H each as doublets. Maybe a meta-substituted group?

Wait, let's think about coupling patterns. For the aromatic protons, each doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps two doublets with 2H each and one with 1H. Alternatively, maybe some coupling between substituents like a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents that cause these patterns. Let's think of a para-substituted benzene. If a substituent is in the para position, the adjacent protons are ortho to that group. So for example, in a para-substituted styrene, the protons on the benzene ring would have certain coupling.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a downfield shift, so perhaps there's an electron-withdrawing group nearby, like an epoxide oxygen. Epoxides can cause deshielding of adjacent protons.

Oh wait, the reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. What's that used for? It's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's used in an elimination reaction. If Compound X is some kind of epoxide, maybe this base deprotonates something, leading to ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the product. The NMR data is
