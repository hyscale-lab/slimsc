Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options given are A to D, each with different values for v_rel and E.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, I remember that when adding velocities in relativity, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity is the difference between their speeds, corrected by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If one object is moving at v1 and another at v2 in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the first isn't just v1 - v2. Because of relativity, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the relative speed u would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²).

Wait, but wait, if both are moving in the same direction, v1 is the speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Let me think: the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by that factor.

Wait, no, no. Because if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

So, numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0
