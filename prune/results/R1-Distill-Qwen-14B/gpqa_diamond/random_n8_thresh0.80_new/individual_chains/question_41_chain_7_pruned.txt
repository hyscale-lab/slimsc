Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass. The glass has an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, it's related to special relativity, specifically how different reference frames perceive things. Wait, but I'm a bit hazy on this. Let me think.

So, normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium (glass) is moving. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at a different speed because the glass is moving relative to them.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So if the glass is moving, but the light is in the same direction, does that affect the speed the observer measures?

Wait, no, because of the postulate of special relativity that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But here, the light is in glass, which is a medium. So how does that work?

Ah, right. The speed of light in the medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. But when the medium itself is moving, the observer would see a different speed.

Wait, so the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think I should consider the frame transformations. Let's model it. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But when we switch frames, how does that velocity transform?

Wait, velocity transformations in special relativity use the Lorentz transformation. So if the glass is moving at speed v, and in its own frame the light has velocity u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity), then what is the velocity u observed in the lab frame?

The velocity addition formula is u
