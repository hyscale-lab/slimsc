Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and some experiments done with mice. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about why there's no green signal when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. The green signal probably comes from the eGFP, right? So if they don't see it, something's wrong with the expression of the receptor or the eGFP.

First, let's understand the setup. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So the ligand comes first, then the receptor.

I remember that in bicistronic vectors, the two genes are under different promoters. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, I think. So the ligand should be expressed whenever the vector is active.

Wait, the stop in a loxP cassette is between the ligand and mCherry. So the ligand is in frame, but the mCherry is probably under a stop cassette that's under the control of loxP. So when Cre is present, the stop is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed alongside the ligand. But the same goes for the receptor and eGFP. The stop between them is under a lox2272 cassette. So Cre is needed to remove that stop as well.

Now, the experiment: they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and did a Western blot. The blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they probably checked if the ligand and receptor were expressed. But the question is about the mouse model.

They made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, right? So Cre would only be active in cells where SOX10 is expressed, which includes neural crest cells and their derivatives, like astrocytes.

So in the mouse, the Cre should be active in certain cells, which would excise the loxP stops. So the ligand and mCherry should be expressed from the first cassette, and the receptor and eGFP from the second, in the same cells where Cre is active.

But in the offspring, they don't see the green signal, which is from eGFP. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? Maybe not directly. I think this option is about function, not expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The eGFP is on the C-terminus of the receptor. If the receptor isn't trafficked properly, maybe it's stuck. But why would that happen? Did the construct include a signal for transport? The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be transported normally. Maybe if the eGFP is causing a problem, but I'm not sure. This seems possible, but let me think more.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so it's constitutive. The construct has the promoter, so it should be expressed regardless of enhancers. Unless the enhancer is needed for the promoter, but CBA is a strong promoter without needing enhancers. So this might not be the issue.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the vector is designed so that the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette is in between, but the reading frame is wrong, then the eGFP may not be expressed correctly. So when the stop is removed (with Cre), the receptor and eGFP would be in the same frame, allowing the eGFP to be expressed as a fusion protein. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might be truncated.

Wait, the initial setup: the ligand is 5', with a stop cassette before mCherry. The receptor is 3', with a stop cassette before eGFP. So the receptor ORF is after the IRES. Wait, wait, bicistronic vectors usually have two ORFs under a single promoter, but I'm not sure if this is the case here. Or maybe it's two separate promoters. Wait, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, then the receptor is under an IRES, which is a terminator and internal ribosome entry site. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and then the IRES drives the receptor. So the vector is a single transcript, with the ligand first, then an IRES, then the receptor.

So when Cre is present, the loxP stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But if the stop cassettes aren't correctly removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active in the right cells.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because the reading frame is wrong. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If they are not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. For example, the stop cassette could have a stop codon, and the loxP sites to remove it. But if the removal doesn't correctly align the frames, then the eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion.

So if the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So when the stop is removed, the ORF would continue into the eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't made.

So the problem would be option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but how would that happen? Because when the stop cassette is removed, the ORF continues. So if the original construct has the receptor's ORF correctly in frame with eGFP after the stop is removed, then eGFP should be expressed. So if they are not in frame, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, or the ORFs are mis
