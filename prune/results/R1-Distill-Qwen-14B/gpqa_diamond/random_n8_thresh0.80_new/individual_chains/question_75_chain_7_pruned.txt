Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They modified the gene to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are testing expression. But wait, the overexpression isn't happening as expected. They looked at the sequence of the plus strand of their construct and noticed something wrong.

Looking at the options, the issue could be any of the four: missense mutation in the HA tag, premature termination, proteolysis due to missing linker, or a missing tRNA for UAA. 

Let me think about the sequence provided. The construct is a coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag is at the beginning. HA is a short peptide, right? The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the HA tag would follow. 

Looking at the sequence, the HA tag is at the very beginning. The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, if I remember correctly. But wait, the construct's sequence starts with ATG, then TAC (which is tyrosine), then CCATACGATG... Let me think. Wait, the HA tag is added, so the first codon after the start should be the first amino acid of HA, which is tyrosine (TAC is TAC, which is Y). Then comes CCATACGATG, which might continue the HA sequence. Wait, but I'm not sure if the HA tag is correctly incorporated.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing a problem. The question says the HA is introduced as a single determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA tag before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the sequence starts with ATG, then the HA tag, then the GADD45G starts.

Wait, but the sequence provided begins with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... So, that's ATG (start), TAC is Tyrosine, CCA is Proline, TAC is Tyrosine, GAT is Asp, GTA is Val. Hmm, that's the start. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Translating the DNA:

The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA would be TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTA (V), ... Wait, but the HA tag's DNA is more like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA TTA GAA. Hmm, maybe. Let me think: Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y again TAC, D is GAT, V is GTA, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCT. Or something like that. So the initial part of the construct should have the HA tag right after the ATG.

Looking at the given sequence: after ATG, the first
