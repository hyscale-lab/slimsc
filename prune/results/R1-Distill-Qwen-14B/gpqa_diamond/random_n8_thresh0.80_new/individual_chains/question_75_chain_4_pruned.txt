Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G protein. They've modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then they're using Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells. But when they check, they can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The question is why they're not getting the protein expressed. They provided the sequence of the plus strand of their construct. Oh right, the options are A to D, each giving a possible reason.

So first, I need to look at the sequence they provided to see if anything stands out. Let me think about the structure of a gene construct. Usually, a gene would have a promoter, the coding sequence (CDS) with start and stop codons, maybe a poly-A signal, etc. But the sequence given is the coding sequence, I believe.

Wait, the person said they introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. So HA is a small peptide tag added to the beginning of the protein. The coding sequence for HA is inserted right after the start codon. So the construct should have ATG followed by HA codons, then the rest of GADD45G.

Looking at the sequence, the first thing I see is 5' ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, wait, but the HA tag's sequence is... I think HA is a specific peptide, maybe something like YPYDVPDYD or similar. Let's think about the DNA sequence that codes for that.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure of the exact HA sequence, but I know it's a short tag. So the HA coding sequence should begin after the ATG.

Looking at the given sequence after ATG: the next codons are TAC, which is tyrosine (TAC is Tryptophan, wait no, TAC is Tyrosine in DNA terms? Wait, wait, no. In DNA, the codons are on the mRNA. Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA but T instead of U.

Wait, no. Wait, the plus strand is the same as the mRNA except T becomes U. So the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the next codons are TAC. So in mRNA, that would be AUG AUC, which is methionine followed by isoleucine? Wait, no. Let me think again. DNA is double-stranded, and the plus strand is the same as mRNA, replacing T with U. Wait, no. The coding strand is the plus strand, which is complementary to the template strand. So the plus strand is the same as the mRNA.

So the plus strand's sequence is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT... So the first codon is ATG (methionine), the second is TAC (tyrosine), third is CCA (pro
