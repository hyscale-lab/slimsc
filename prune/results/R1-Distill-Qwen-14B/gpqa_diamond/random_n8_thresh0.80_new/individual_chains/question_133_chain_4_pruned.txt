Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything about phosphate buffer solutions. But let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4³⁻, in this solution. Hmm, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into ions. But in a buffer solution, the phosphate species can be H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, or PO4³⁻, depending on the pH.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Then, knowing the pH, you can find the concentration of the different phosphate species.

Wait, but wait. What are the species here? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4⁻. So H2PO4⁻ is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid). Then, Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate, right? So that would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4²⁻. 

So, in solution, we have H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. These are two consecutive conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4⁻ can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4²⁻) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Wait no, that's not right. Wait, H3PO4 is the first dissociation: H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4⁻. Then H2PO4⁻ → H+ + HPO4²⁻, and HPO4²⁻ → H+ + PO4³⁻.

So, in the solution, we have a mixture of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. That makes this a buffer solution between the second and first dissociation steps. So, the relevant pKa would be the second one, which is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. Because H2PO4⁻ is the acid, and HPO4²⁻ is the conjugate base. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]).

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4³⁻, the deprotonated form. Hmm, but in this buffer system, PO4³⁻ is not likely to be a major species because the pH is probably around the pKa2.
