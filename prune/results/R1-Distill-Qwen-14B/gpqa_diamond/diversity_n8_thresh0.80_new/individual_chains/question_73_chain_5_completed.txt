Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, relativistic speeds... right, so we're dealing with special relativity here. I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, the usual classical mechanics don't apply, and we need to use the formulas from Einstein's theory.

First, the relative speed. I think when you have two objects moving in the same direction, you can't just subtract their speeds like you normally would in classical mechanics. Instead, you use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)).

Wait, but wait. In this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So if I'm finding the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa? Or maybe the problem is asking for the speed of one relative to the other, regardless of direction.

Let me think. The problem says the relative speed. So perhaps it's the speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's frame. Let's pick one. Let's say we want the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame.

So A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c, but that's just the classical approach. But relativity says that's not correct. So we have to apply the relativistic formula.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for velocity addition is when you have two frames moving at speed v relative to each other. If in frame S, an object has velocity u, then in frame S' moving at speed v relative to S, the object's velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, frame S is the rest frame of astronaut A. So astronaut A is stationary in S, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c relative to S. Wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction as per the lab frame. Let me clarify.

Wait, maybe I should define the lab frame as the rest frame. In the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c.

We need to find the relative speed between them. So perhaps from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

So in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c. So the relative speed would be the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. So using the velocity addition formula, u' is the velocity of B in A's frame.

Wait, no. Let me get the setup right. Let's say the lab frame is S. In S, A is moving at u_A = 0.6c, and B is moving at u_B = 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction.

We want to find the velocity of B as observed from A's rest frame, which is S'. S' is moving at v = 0.6c relative to S. So using the velocity addition formula:

u'_B = (u_B - v) / [1 - (u_B v)/(c²)]

Plugging in the numbers:

u'_B = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)].

Calculate numerator: 0.5-0.6 = -0.1 → -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u'_B = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, but since it's negative, it's moving in the opposite direction relative to A. Wait, but the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction in the lab frame. So when viewed from A's frame, is B moving slower or faster?

Wait, because from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c, B is moving at a lower speed (0.5c in the lab frame), so from A's perspective, B would actually appear to be moving backward relative to A. So the relative speed would be 0.1428c in the negative direction. But the question asks for the relative speed, so probably just the magnitude. So approximately 0.14c.

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel = 0.14c, and option D also 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Wait, the system consists of both astronauts. So I need to calculate their relativistic energies and sum them.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². But their masses are 2m and 3m. So:

E_total = E_A + E_B = gamma_A*(2m c²) + gamma_B*(3m c²)

Where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for astronaut A, and similarly for B.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Astronaut A's speed is 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B's speed is 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u_B - u_A}{1 - \frac{u_A u_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u_A = 0.6c\) and \(u_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\) (ignoring the negative sign, as speed is a magnitude).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
