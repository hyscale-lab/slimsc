Okay, I need to find the uncertainty in P_z for the given quantum state. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩.

But wait, the matrix forms of the operators are given. Also, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So I need to work in that basis, which means |ψ⟩ is already expressed in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. That should make things easier because acting with P_z on |ψ⟩ is straightforward.

Let me write down the state again. The components are:
ψ_1 = -1/2,
ψ_2 = 1/sqrt(2),
ψ_3 = -1/2.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Looking at the matrix of P_z:

P_z matrix:
[ ħ    0    0 ]
[ 0    0    0 ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

So the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the components of |ψ⟩ and λ_i are the eigenvalues of P_z.

Let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. The components are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

The probabilities (|c_i|^2) are:
|c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,
|c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2,
|c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

The eigenvalues for each component are:
eigenvalue of |1⟩: ħ,
eigenvalue of |2⟩: 0,
eigenvalue of |3⟩: -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

Wait, that makes sense. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the answer.

But let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, the state is given as a column vector (–1/2, 1/sqrt(2), –1/2). So the components are correct. The modulus squared is correct for each component. So the calculation seems right.

Yes, I think that's correct. So the uncertainty is hbar over root 2, option B
