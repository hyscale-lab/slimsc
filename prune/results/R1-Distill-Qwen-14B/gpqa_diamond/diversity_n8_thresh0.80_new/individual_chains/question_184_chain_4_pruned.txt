Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The substituents are on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering them should be done in a way that the substituents are in the correct positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering goes like this: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, which are adjacent to each other. So they must be meta to each other? Wait, no. If I number it as 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), then they're in positions 1, 2, and 3 around the ring, which are adjacent in a row. So that would make them para to each other? No, wait. Let me draw it out.

Imagine benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, next is position 2 (tert-butyl), then position 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in adjacent positions, sort of like 1,2,3 in a row. That makes the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups adjacent, and the nitro is next to the tert-butyl.

Now, the question is about the synthesis route. So I need to perform a series of reactions starting from benzene to get this compound.

I remember that electrophilic substitution reactions are the way to go for benzene. The order in which substituents are added will influence the positions where subsequent substituents are added due to directing effects.

Benzene is activated or deactivated by substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Ethoxy groups are activating and ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl groups are bulky, but they are also activating (since they're alkyl groups) and ortho/para directors.

Wait, but the substituents can influence each other. The order in which we add them will determine the positions. So let me think about the directing effects.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The nitro group is a strong meta director, while the ethoxy and tert-butyl are ortho/para directors and activating.

So let me think about the possible steps.

I think the nitro group is usually introduced via nitration, which is a reaction that uses HNO3 and H2SO4 as a nitrating agent, typically under certain conditions. However, this is a strong nitrating mixture and can be a bit tricky because the order of reactions affects where
