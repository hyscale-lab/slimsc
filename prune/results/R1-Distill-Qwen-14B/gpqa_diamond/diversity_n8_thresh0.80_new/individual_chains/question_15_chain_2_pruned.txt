Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on a few factors, like the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. So, their masses are equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. The orbital periods relate to the size of their orbits, right? Using Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed over the star's mass. But since we're comparing two planets around different stars, I have to account for that.

Both stars have the same radius, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has mass M1 = 2*M2, where M2 is Star_2's mass. But both stars have the same radius, R.

Wait, the probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but wait, the star's radius is the same for both. So R1 = R2 = R. But what about the orbital distance? Because the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, more accurately, the probability P is approximately (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (m_planet/m_star)^(1/3))) ), but wait, no, actually I think the probability is proportional to (R*/a) multiplied by something else related to the inclination. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for transit probability.

The transit probability is given by P ≈ (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (m_p/(m_* + m_p))^(1/3))) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think a better approach is to think about the geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the distance at which the planet orbits, but scaled by something else.

Wait,
