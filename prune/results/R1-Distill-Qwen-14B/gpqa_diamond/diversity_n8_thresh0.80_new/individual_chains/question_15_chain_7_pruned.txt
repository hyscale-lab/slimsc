Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so that the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

Alright, the question says both planets are detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But both have the same mass. Interesting. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's orbital period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1? Wait no, wait, no wait, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh right, so that would make P1 = P2 /3. Because if P1 is shorter, it's like, for example, if P2 is 9 days, P1 is 3 days. So P1 is 1/3 of P2's period.

Both have circular orbits, so that shouldn't complicate things. The host stars: the one with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. So Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has M1 = 2*M2, where M2 is the mass of Star_2. But R1 = R2, since both stars have the same radius.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / (a + R_s)) or something like that? I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / (a))Â², but wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the sizes. Let me think.

Wait, no. The probability of a transit is actually the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit, but only for edge-on orbits. Oh wait, no, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_star / a) / (something). Oh right, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. But wait, the exact formula I'm a bit fuzzy on. Let me recall.

I remember that the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star / a) * (something with
