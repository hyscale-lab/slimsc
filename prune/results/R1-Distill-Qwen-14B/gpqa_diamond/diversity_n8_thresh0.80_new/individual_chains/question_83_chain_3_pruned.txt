Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. Right, so when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. I remember that Molarity is moles per liter, so when you dilute, the volume increases, but the moles remain the same.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters), and the concentration is 0.05 M. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity * Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). So the new concentration after dilution would be moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M acetic acid. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, that probably means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the moles of NaOH added at 25% and then determine the pH based on that.

Wait, let's think about the equivalence point first because that might be easier. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed would be the same (since it's a 1:1 reaction). So moles NaOH = 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the problem is asking about two points: 25% titration (so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added?) and the equivalence point.

Wait, no. Wait, the titration is adding NaOH to the diluted solution. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So the total moles of acetic acid is 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles, right? So the equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters = 10 cm³.

So at 25% titration, it's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 liters. Moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid.

So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, producing the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-).

So initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles have been neutralized. So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, we're adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 liters.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.
