Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Alright, let me read the question again. The two stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental ratios, so maybe I can focus on the abundances.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Hmm, what do these mean? I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y in the star, minus the same ratio in the Sun. If [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5. Wait, wait, 12 + log(...) equals 7.5? So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H in star) over (Fe/H in Sun). So if [Fe/H] is 0, their Fe/H ratios are the same. So Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun's.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I'm looking for n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Let me think about the steps.

First, for each star, I can find the ratio of Si to H, because the Sun's ratios are known, and the [X/Y] values can help.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. Since [Fe/H] is 0, that might relate Fe and H, so perhaps I can find the ratio of Si to H using that.

Let me think for Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3. [Fe/H]1 =0.

[Si/Fe] is log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X /n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Fe/H]_1 is log(nFe_
