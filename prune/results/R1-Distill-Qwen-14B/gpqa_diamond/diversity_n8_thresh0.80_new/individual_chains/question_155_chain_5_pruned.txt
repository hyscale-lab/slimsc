Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

First, let me recall that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute both the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ and the expectation value of P_z squared ⟨P_z²⟩. Then subtract the square of the first from the second and take the square root.

Wait, but wait. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors. 

So first, I need to represent the given state in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. But wait, the state is given as a column vector, and I think the basis here is already the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the columns of the matrix are the eigenstates of P_z.

So the state vector is already in the basis where P_z is diagonal. Hmm, then the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities of each eigenvalue multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The state is a column vector (a, b, c), which can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. So the state is a combination of |ψ₁⟩, |ψ₂⟩, |ψ₃⟩, each with coefficients a, b, c.

Looking at the matrix P_z, which is diagonal:
P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]
So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The diagonal entries correspond to the eigenvalues for each basis vector.
