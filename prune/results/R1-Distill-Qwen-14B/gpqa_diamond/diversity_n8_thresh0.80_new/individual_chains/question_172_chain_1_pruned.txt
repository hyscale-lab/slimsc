Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out which equation correctly relates the temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms relates to the thermal energy of the star's atmosphere. So higher excitation would mean higher temperature, right?

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. I think that's the ΔE value. Oh, wait, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like the ratio of populations in two states is equal to the exponential of -(ΔE)/(k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or another lower state) would be given by the Boltzmann factor. The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me think: if the ratio of excited to non-excited states for star_1 is twice that of star_2, then I can set up the equations.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as N1 and for star_2 as N2. So N1 = 2*N2. According to the Boltzmann equation, each N is equal to [g2/g1] * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the energy levels. Assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, which they probably are since it's the same element, I can ignore them for now.

So for star_1: N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: N2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the lower energy state is the ground state, and the excited state is higher. So actually, the ratio is N_upper / N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio of excited to non-excited is 2:1 for star_1, and 1:1 for star_2? Or wait, no. Wait, it's stated that the excitation level is twice. Let me re-read.

It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the ratio of excited atoms (say, in a higher state) to the lower state is higher in star_1. Suppose that the excitation level is proportional to the population in the upper state. So N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower). Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's.

So, N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower)

But from Boltzmann, N_upper
