Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Uniformly distributed probably means that the number of stars doesn't depend on the direction you look, so they're spread out evenly across the celestial sphere.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 parsecs is twice as far.

The options are about the dependence on 1/plx raised to some power. So I need to find a function that relates the number of stars in a certain parallax range to the parallax itself.

Wait, when you have a uniform distribution in three-dimensional space, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Parallax relates to distance. The parallax formula is plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as plx decreases, the distance increases.

But stars are spread out, so the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars would be proportional to r² dr. But since d is the distance, r is d. So substituting, the number is proportional to d² dd.

Wait, but how does this relate to plx? Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting d in terms of plx, the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but wait, since d is 1/plx, dd would be (1/plx²) d(plx). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of a differential element in parallax space.

Let's think in terms of parallax. Let's say we have a small change in parallax, d plx. What's the corresponding change in distance, and what's the volume associated with that change?

Distance d is
