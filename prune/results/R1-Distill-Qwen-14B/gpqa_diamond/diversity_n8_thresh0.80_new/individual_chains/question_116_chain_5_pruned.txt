Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, compound A has an NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, probably from adjacent CH2 groups. The quartet would mean each proton is next to three others, maybe from a CH3 group attached to a CH2.

The integration is 6H for the triplet and 4H for the quartet. Wait, 6H could be like two CH3 groups because 2*3=6. And 4H could be a CH2CH2 group, maybe two CH2 groups. So perhaps it's like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2? No, wait. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is probably two equivalent CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H might be adjacent to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2, so maybe like (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2? Or wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. Oh, wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. But the NMR here is for a proton, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, another structure that fits this NMR is neopentane, but no, that's 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its NMR would have a singlet, though, because all the CH3 are equivalent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like diethyl something. For example, diethyl ether (Et2O) has two CH3CH2 groups. The protons on the CH3 would be split by the adjacent CH2. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two H's. So the triplet makes sense. The CH2 protons would be next to the oxygen and adjacent to another CH2. Wait, the CH2 adjacent to oxygen would be a quartet because each is next to a CH3 (3 H's). So in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 groups would have their CH3 as triplet (each adjacent to CH2), and the CH2 as quartet (each adjacent to CH3). But wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2 protons are adjacent to the oxygen and to each other. Let me think: each CH2 has two neighboring groups — the oxygen and another CH2. So each CH2 in diethyl ether would be split into a quartet by the adjacent CH2 with two H's. Wait, no, the splitting comes from neighboring H's. So the CH2 next to the CH3 would have each of their H's split by the neighboring CH3's H's. So each CH2 in CH2CH3 would have a triplet (because adjacent to a CH3 with 3 H). Wait, no, the CH2 is next to CH3, so each H on the CH2 would couple with the 3 H on the adjacent CH3. That would give a quartet for the CH2 and triplet for the CH3. Oh wait, the triplet at 0.9 is 6H, so that's two CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 is 4H, which would be two CH2 groups. So if it's diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. Then, the NMR would show the CH3 as triplet (each adjacent to a CH2 with 2 H), and the CH2 as quartet (each adjacent to a CH3 with 3 H). That fits! So compound A is diethyl ether.

Wait, but wait. Diethyl ether's protons: The CH3 groups are at around δ 1.2 ppm as triplet, and the CH2 would be around δ 3.4 ppm, but in this case, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm. Hmm, that's conflicting. Because diethyl ether's CH2 is around 3.4, not 1.3. So that can't be right.

So maybe it's another structure. Hmm, perhaps it's something else, like diethyl something else, maybe an ester or an ether.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's 2-methylpropanol? No, that would have more peaks. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative. Or perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to another structure, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think about the integrations again. 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. So 6H could be two CH3 groups, each split into triplet. 4H could be two CH2 groups, each split into quartet. So perhaps it's a structure where two CH3 are attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to two more CH2 groups. Like maybe CH3CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that might not give the right splitting.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ester. Like diethyl acetate? No, diethyl acetate would have more protons. Let me think about the structure: diethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. Its NMR would show the CH3CO as a quartet, the OCH2CH3 as a quartet and triplet, but that doesn't match the given data.

Wait, perhaps it's not an ether or ester. Let's think about other possibilities. Maybe the molecule is a diethylamine? Like ethylamine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to an oxygen in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something else, like neopentyl something.
