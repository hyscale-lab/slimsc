Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, hence the negative values.

First, I think I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base because the reaction stoichiometry depends on that. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of H+ ions reacting with OH- ions. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll dissociate completely, right? H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, does it donate one or two H+? Oh right, sulfuric acid is diprotic, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. But wait, in the reaction with a base, how does that play out?

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions when dissolved in water, because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So the plan is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, figure out which one is the limiting reactant because the neutralization will depend on the amounts of H+ and OH- available.

Let's break it down. 

First, calculate moles of HCl. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.2 M in 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole H+. So moles H+ from HCl is 0.1.

Next, H2SO4. It's 0.3 M in 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives two H+ ions. So moles H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait a minute, the reaction between an acid and a base is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the H+ and OH- should combine in a 1:1 ratio. So let's see, total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is the limiting reactant here. Because 0.28 > 0.2, the OH- will run out first. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

But wait, wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ reacting. I think the value is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. But wait, let me think. Oh, right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it releases 57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.
