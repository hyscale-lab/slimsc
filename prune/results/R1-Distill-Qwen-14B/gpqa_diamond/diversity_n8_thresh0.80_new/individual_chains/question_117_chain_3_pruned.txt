Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the four given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Remember, a chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the rings being arranged differently. But wait, biphenyls can have different conformations like coplanar or non-coplanar. But in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions on each ring. If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe? Wait, but wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, could they form enantiomers? Or maybe it's about the possibility of the rings being in different configurations. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think. The substituents are at 2 and 2' for the carboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at para positions. Wait, but the biphenyl might be able to rotate, but if the substituents are all in positions that make each ring have identical substituents, does that lead to any chirality? Or maybe each ring's substituents are symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality. Wait, if each ring is symmetric, then maybe it doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, maybe the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) is connected to two methyl groups and two other groups. Wait, no, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two phenyl rings are connected via a single bond. So the central carbon is actually part of the biphenyl? No, wait, the biphenyl is a structure where two benzene rings are connected by a single bond between adjacent carbons—like positions 1 and 1'. So the central carbon is part of each benzene ring, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is at 2 and 2' on each benzene ring. Wait, maybe that's not directly relevant. Let me think about the substituents. The compound is dimethyl, so two methyl ester groups. And the substituents are at 6 and 6'—so each ring has a nitro group in the para position relative to the connecting bond. Also, each ring has a carboxylate at 2 and 2', which is the meta position relative to the connecting bond. So the structure is two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', each with a nitro at 6 and 6', and a carboxylate at 2 and 2', and each ester is a methyl group. So, the molecule would have two ester groups (O-CO-OCH3) and two nitro groups. Now, does this lead to any chiral centers? Are there any carbons with four different substituents? Let me think. The central carbon is part of the biphenyl structure. Wait, each of the carbons in the biphenyl is part of the benzene rings, so they are sp² hybridized and can't be chiral centers. The ester groups: the oxygen is connected to a methyl (OCH3) and the carbonyl (COO). The carbonyl is connected to the benzene rings. Wait, the carbonyl carbons in the ester are double-bonded to oxygen, so they can't be chiral. So where else? Are there any other carbons with four different substituents? Maybe the nitro groups are attached to the benzene rings, which are sp², so they don't contribute. So perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has some kind of hindered rotation leading to atropisomerism. Oh, right! If the molecule has a high barrier to rotation around the central bond, the different conformations could lead to stereoisomerism. For example, in biphenyl compounds, the substituents on each ring can be in different positions relative to each other, leading to diastereomers. But do they exhibit optical isomerism, or just geometric isomerism? Wait, optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which require chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry. If the biphenyl rings can't rotate freely, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry or not. If there's a plane, it won't be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have optical isomers. Wait, but the molecule in question has substituents
