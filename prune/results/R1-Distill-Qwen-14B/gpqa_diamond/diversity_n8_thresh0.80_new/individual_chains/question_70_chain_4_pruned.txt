Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions leading to a product E, and we need to find its molecular symmetry group. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Wait, molecular symmetry groups... that's about point groups, right? So I need to figure out the structure of E and then determine its point group.

Let me read the reactions again to figure out what's going on.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8. Maybe a metal reacting with something in a high ratio.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So now C is reacting with D in a 1:2 ratio.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So when C is in water, it's probably hydrolyzing into A, F, and G. Strong acids like HCl or H2SO4, weak like acetic acid maybe.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent, maybe something like ethanol or water, but more likely a common solvent. But wait, D and B react 1:1 to make H. So if B is, say, a halogen, D could be an alcohol or something else.

Let me start piecing this together.

Looking at the third reaction first: C when it reacts with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So perhaps C is a salt. When the salt is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong and a weak acid. For example, maybe like sodium cyanide (but that produces a weak acid), wait, but more likely, something like ammonium nitrate? No, that would produce HNO3, a strong acid, but wait, when ammonium nitrate is hydrolyzed, it produces NH4OH (which is weak, but actually NH4+ and OH-; no, wait, maybe it's more like a nitrate and another acid. Maybe it's a nitrate and sulfate? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the first reaction. A reacting with 8 equivalents of B to make C. Suppose A is something like Fe, and B is Cl2. But 8 equivalents would imply multiple bonds. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. Let's think about a metal reacting with chlorine.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents might mean that each mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. For example, if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, but that would need each Fe atom to react with 3 Cl2 molecules, which is 6 Cl per Fe. Wait, 8 is a larger number. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal in a +2 or +3 oxidation state.

Wait, another idea: Maybe A is copper (Cu), and B is sulfur (S) gas. But sulfur as gas is S8, so maybe 8 equivalents would fit. So Cu + S8 → CuS? But I'm not sure about the red product. Alternatively, perhaps
