Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about identifying the correct starting materials A and B that, when treated with different reducing agents, give the same product but as enantiomers.

Hmm, the product in both cases is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, actually, the products are enantiomers because the configurations are R and S. So, one reaction gives R, the other gives S.

The reactions are: 
1. A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
2. B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 (which is usually used as a borane, maybe with THF?) is a milder one. Oh wait, but wait, BH3 is typically used in the formation of alcohols from ketones, but wait, in the context of ketones, BH3 could also be used for certain reductions. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So, when you reduce a cyclic ketone, you're adding hydrogen to form a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the product here is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the structure where there's a five-membered ring (pyran is a six-membered ring, but maybe in this case it's a five-membered ring?), no, wait, pyran is a six-membered ring, with one oxygen. So 2H-pyran-2-one would be a gamma-pyrone? Wait, pyran is O with five carbons, so pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone at position 2. So, the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone group at position 2. So, when you reduce it, the ketone (C=O) becomes
