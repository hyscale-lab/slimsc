Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I'm a bit rusty on my nomenclature, but I think that means there's a ketone at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring. The substituents at positions 2 and 6 are ethyl and methyl groups, respectively. Wait, no. Let me clarify the numbering. The cyclohexanone is at position 1, so positions 2 and 6 have substituents. So, position 2 is ethyl and position 6 is methyl. Or wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl... oh, so the 2 position has an ethyl group and a methyl group? No, wait, each substituent is separate. So the molecule is a cyclohexane ring where position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Hmm, no. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. So the 2 position has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. Position 6 has a methyl group as well. So the ring has substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl), and the ketone is at 1.

The reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. Ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is likely a Michael addition reaction. Wait, but wait, wait. Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to a Michael acceptor (like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl). Alternatively, in some cases, the enolate could attack the acrylate.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Let me think. The cyclohexanone is electron-deficient at the carbonyl. But ethyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOEt. It's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. So the cyclohexanone would form an enolate, which would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a conjugate addition.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The enolate would form at the alpha position. Since the starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So positions 2 and 6? Wait, no. The carbonyl is at position 1. So the alpha carbons are positions 2 and
