Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions.

Step one: Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms, probably a di-elimination? Wait, but with two Brs, maybe two E2 reactions? Or perhaps a double elimination leading to a diene or an alkyne? Hmm, but with KOH, E2 is more likely than E1, which needs a good leaving group. Oh, but wait, when you have two adjacent leaving groups, sometimes an elimination can form a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, so perhaps they can eliminate twice to form a conjugated diene? Or maybe a single elimination would form a mono-ene, but I think with two bromines, you might form a diene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh, wait, so maybe elimination didn't happen. Maybe instead, it's an elimination followed by some kind of ring formation? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via some mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a double elimination, but since the product has a carbonyl, maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction? But with KOH, substitution (like SN2) would require a good leaving group, but Br is a decent leaving group. Wait, but the product after KOH is a solid with a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. But the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe that's not it. Wait, but what if it's an elimination forming a ketone? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data. Product 1 has 1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH or something else, but wait, in D2O it would exchange. But the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. So, perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe an epoxide with a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Wait, epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but the 4.79 is quite upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated dienol or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a four-fused six-membered ring structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. When heated with KOH, perhaps elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules. If the two Br atoms are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond. But in adamantane, the positions are fixed, so perhaps it's a bridgehead elimination, which is possible under certain conditions.

Wait, bridgehead elimination? That typically requires a good leaving group and heat. For example, in norbornene, when you have a leaving group at the bridgehead, elimination can form an alkene. But in this case, we have two Brs perhaps on adjacent bridgehead positions. So eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated diene or maybe a more complex structure.

But the product after KOH is giving a light yellow solid with a carbonyl. Hmm. Wait, maybe the elimination forms a ketone. If KOH is acting as a base, could it cause a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group? But how?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about another reaction. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but that usually forms alkenes. But if the structure is such that two adjacent Brs are present, eliminating two HBr could form a triple bond. So, for example, if you have two Brs on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr would form a triple bond. So, the product would be an alkyne. But then, the IR would show a peak around 2100 cm⁻¹, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but I don't see an OH peak in the IR. Wait, the IR at 1720 is a carbonyl, so probably a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution. With KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Brs, maybe each is replaced by an O- group, but that would form a diol. But then, how do you get a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the base is causing the formation of an epoxide. Epoxide formation typically uses a base like KOH with a vicinal dihalide. Oh, wait! If you have a vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromo compound), treating with KOH can form an epoxide.
