Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen connected to an alkyl group. So, the structure likely includes an ester group attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Two for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. Hmm, okay. So, let's think about what this means.

First, the aromatic protons. In a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern can vary—ortho, meta, para positions. The number of signals depends on that. But here, there are two signals for aromatic H. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that split the aromatic protons into two sets. For example, para substitution would lead to two equivalent sets of protons, each as a singlet, but if the substituents are in positions that cause more splitting, perhaps it's a different arrangement. Wait, no, para would lead to two equivalent Hs on each ring position, but maybe they are in a situation where they are not all equivalent. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else, but I'm not sure yet.

The vinyl protons: two signals—one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are typically from alkenes or aromatic rings. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, maybe there's another double bond somewhere. Wait, but benzene itself is a ring of double bonds. Alternatively, the substituents have double bonds. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester attached via a vinyl group. Or perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group, like an ethenyl (CH2CH2) group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR says two vinyl H signals. So, maybe the substituents include a vinyl group. Let me think: an ester group attached with a vinyl group, perhaps. Or maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each has a vinyl attached.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent Hs. A doublet implies each H is coupling with one other H, perhaps. A doublet of quartets would be more complex—maybe each H is coupling with two sets of Hs.

Also, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, two methyl groups somewhere in the molecule. And there are no –CH2 groups, meaning there aren't any methylene groups (CH2) in the structure.

Putting this together: the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester, which would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. The other substituent might be something else. Let's think about possible structures
