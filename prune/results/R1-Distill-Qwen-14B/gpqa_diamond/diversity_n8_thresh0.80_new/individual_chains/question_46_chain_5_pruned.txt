Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So basically, the double bond breaks and reforms in a different position.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule is chiral and has a double bond. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but wait, that's pent-1-ene. But in this case, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, noâ€” wait, wait. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be where? Let me count the carbons. Numbering from the double bond, the first carbon is CH2, then CH, then the next carbon is the third. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, but wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So the molecule is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it correctly.

The
