Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about some chemical reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I need to figure out what E looks like structurally.

Let me start by going through each reaction given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents. That number is a big clue. So A + 8B → C. What's a reaction where a solid combines with gas in an 8:1 ratio? Oh wait, maybe like the formation of a sulfide or something with a high ratio. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, 8 equivalents could mean the formula of C is A(B)_8. Like, perhaps A is Fe and B is S? Because FeS is different, but wait, 8 would be a lot. Wait, FeS is Fe:S 1:1. What about something like Fe3O4? That's FeO·Fe2O3, so overall Fe3O4, which is Fe:O in a 3:4 ratio. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like Fe(OH)3, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal oxide with a high oxidation state. Or maybe a compound like CuO, but that's black. Wait, maybe it's a different kind of compound. Oh! What about a nitride? Or maybe a sulfide. Wait, another thought: when metals react with sulfur, they form sulfides. For example, FeS is black, but FeS8 is a possibility? Wait, I think FeS is a common one, but 8 equivalents would make me think perhaps C is FeS8? Or maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, maybe the solid A is a metal, and B is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), but 8 equivalents would imply 4 molecules of H2S per A. That would give A(S)_8? Or perhaps A is a transition metal that forms an oct sulfide. Alternatively, maybe A is Phosphorus reacting with Chlorine? Wait, PCl5 is a common compound, but that's 5 Cl per P. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product C isn't a metal compound. What about something like silver oxide? No, silver oxide is dark. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Let me think more about the other reactions.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E. Hmm, what reacts with 2 equivalents of D? Let's say D is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2. If E is a hazardous product, maybe something like ClF3? Or maybe a highly reactive compound. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and E is something like SOCl2, but I'm not sure.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is treated with water, it produces A, F, and G. So, for example, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water (H2O) might produce the metal hydroxide and H2S gas. But H2S is a weak acid, but in this case, it's producing two different acids. Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, when it reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 (which would decompose to MgO and water?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, but then perhaps when it reacts with water, it produces H2S and another acid. Wait, no, H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbide, like CaC2. When it reacts with water, it produces acetylene (C2H2) and Ca(OH)2, but that's a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces A, which is a solid, and two acids. So maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Na3N, reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base, but that's not an acid. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Wait, but metal oxides typically react with water to form bases. Unless it's a non-metal oxide, like CO2 or SO3.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reaction with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and maybe the metal's hydroxide. Wait, but in that case, the hydroxide would be a base, not an acid. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate, like BaSO4. But that's not reacting with water. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, but carbonates react with water to form bicarbonate, which is still a carbonate.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydride. For example, if C is LiH, reacting with water would produce LiOH (strong base) and H2 gas. But that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is something else. Let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. So the formula could be A(B)_8. If B is a diatomic gas, then perhaps each molecule contributes two atoms. Wait, but in terms of equivalents, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles per mole of A. So if B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would give 8 Cl atoms per A. So the formula would be ACl8? But what solid A would form ACl8? Maybe something like FeCl8? Wait, I'm not sure if that exists. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, but then 8 O2 would make O16, which seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is H2S. Then 8 moles of H2S per mole of A would give A(H2S)_8. For example, if A is Fe, Fe(H2S)_8? That doesn't sound familiar. Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu, and B is H2S. But I'm not sure about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another type of gas. Let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio to form E. So, if D is O2, perhaps E is a dioxide. But E is extremely hazardous, so maybe something like ClF3 or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the third reaction where C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite (like Na2SO3), then reacting with water (H2O) might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a more complex compound.

Wait, if C is a metal nitride, say, Ca3N2, then reacting with water would produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide of a metal that forms two different acids when reacted with water. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base, not acid) and O2. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So maybe C is a sulfide. When C reacts with water, the sulfide could hydrolyze to produce H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but which acid would that be? Unless the sulfide is of a metal that can form more than one acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (which is a weak acid in water?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride of a group 15 element, like PH3 or something. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what D is. The fourth reaction is D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent, which could be something like H2O (but then D and B would be something else), or maybe H is ethanol, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another possibility: D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, methanol, acetone, etc. So if B is Cl2, and D is another diatomic gas, perhaps O2? No, O2 and Cl2 would form ClO or something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O, and D is something else. Wait, but B is a gas. So maybe B is H2O, but H2O is a liquid at room temp, but perhaps in the reaction it's in gaseous form.

Wait, another thought: D and B combine in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Maybe D is H2O and B is NH3? But then H would be NH4OH, which isn't a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3. Then reaction would be NH3 + H2O → NH4OH, but that's not a very stable solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O (as gas), and D is some other gas, maybe O2? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: D is O2 and B is H2S. Then, O2 + H2S → SO2 + H2O. But that's a reaction, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, D could be O2 and B is C (solid? but B is a gas, so no). Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and B is CH4. Then, CH4 + Cl2 → CCl4 (but that's under UV light, substitution). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is O2. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O (liquid, but a solvent). But that's a 1:1 ratio if considering 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of O2. Wait, but the question says a 1:1 ratio, so perhaps D and B are in 1:1 molar ratio. So if D is H2 and B is O2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So moles ratio is 2:1, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to piece together all the information.

Let's list out the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)

We need to find E's molecular symmetry.

Let me think about possible compounds for C.

C is bright red—maybe a transition metal compound. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but it's not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, what about Cu2S? No, that's black. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a vanadium compound. Vanadium(III) oxide is a bright green. Hmm, not red. Alternatively, maybe C is a mercury compound, but mercury(I) oxide is red. Wait, HgO is red. Oh, right! Mercury(I) oxide is a red solid. So maybe C is HgO.

But then, how does that fit with the other reactions?

So, if C is HgO, then let's see:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → HgO.

So A would be Hg, and B would be O. Wait, but O is not a gas in that form. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2? Then HgO would be formed from Hg and O2. But let's check.

Hg (solid) + O2 (gas) → HgO (bright red). The reaction would be 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. But in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents, so perhaps the formula is HgO2? Or maybe I'm getting the stoichiometry wrong.

Alternatively, maybe C is Fe2O3·nH2O or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think about the third reaction again. When C reacts with water, it gives A, F, and G. So if C is HgO, then HgO + H2O → Hg + O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps HgO reacts with water to produce Hg(OH)2. But that's a base, not an acid. So that's conflicting with F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C isn't HgO. Another possibility: maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say A is Fe, B is S. So Fe + S → FeS. But FeS is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is an oxide of another metal. Like MnO2 is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, what if C is a peroxide? For example, H2O2 is a liquid, but maybe another peroxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different type of compound. Let's think about reaction 4: D and B form H, a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol or water. So if D and B combine to form H, which is a solvent.

Assuming H is water, then D and B could be something like H2 and O2. But the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So D would be H2, B would be O2. But let's see.

Wait, if D is H2 and B is O2, then in reaction 4, 1 mole each would produce 2 moles of H2O. So H is H2O, a solvent.

So going back to reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C. What solid A reacts with O2 to form a bright red product? Hmm, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2. Let's think about metals and their oxides.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is Fe3O4. Iron(II,III) oxide is black, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide. Wait, MnO is pinkish, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal that's bright red. Hmm, I don't recall any common sulfides that are bright red.

Wait, maybe C is CuO. CuO is black, but perhaps in a different form it appears red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide. Wait, maybe it's CoO, which is blue. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound altogether. Let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 moles of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is Cl2, then perhaps E is something like SOCl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, what if C is a metal carbonyl? For example, Fe(CO)5 is a liquid, but I don't know about color. Alternatively, maybe C is a different kind of compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Na3N, reacting with Cl2 (D) would produce NaCl and NCl3. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about E. E is extremely hazardous, so it's likely a compound like sarin, or something like phosgene, or maybe something like hydrogen cyanide. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive molecule like O3 or something else. But O3 is a gas, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like ClF3, which is a highly reactive and hazardous material. So if E is ClF3, then what would C and D be?

ClF3 is produced how? Maybe from Cl2 and F2 in a reaction. Wait, no, ClF3 is synthesized from Cl2 and HF in the presence of a catalyst, perhaps. So if in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (which is F2?) to form ClF3. Then, 2 F2 would add per C. Hmm, but then what is C?

Wait, maybe C is ClF. Then, ClF + F2 → ClF3. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClF3 itself, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let me think of other hazardous compounds. Maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. So how would that form? From CO2 and Cl2? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is mustard gas, but that's a sulfur-based compound.

Wait, another approach: if E is a molecule with a certain symmetry, what are the options? The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. These are symmetry groups. So I need to figure out what E's structure is to determine its symmetry.

D4h is a high symmetry group, including a four-fold axis with horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite symmetry, like in a linear molecule with multiple identical atoms, such as O2 or CO2. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. C2v has a two-fold rotation plus a vertical mirror plane.

So, if E is a molecule with linear structure and multiple identical atoms, its symmetry would be D∞h. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. Another example is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry as a linear molecule.

Wait, but if E is O2, then how would it form? Let me see.

Let me try to put all this together again.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O, then D and B could be H2 and O2. So, D is H2, B is O2.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So A is a metal that reacts with O2 in an 8:1 ratio. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in a 1:4 ratio. Wait, maybe A is Pb, which forms PbO2. Wait, but PbO2 is dark brown. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, which forms Fe3O4. Fe3O4 has the formula FeO·Fe2O3, which is Fe3O4. So the ratio is 3 Fe to 4 O. But in reaction 1, it's 8 O2 per A. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 O2 molecules. So per mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. So the formula of C would be A(O2)_8. But O2 is a diatomic molecule, so each O2 provides two O atoms. So 8 O2 would give 16 O atoms. So the formula would be AO16. That's a lot of O atoms. What metal forms an oxide with 16 O atoms per atom? Hmm, perhaps a transition metal with a very high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if A is Na, then NaO2 is sodium peroxide, which is a solid. But sodium peroxide is Na2O2, so formula is Na2O2. That's 2 Na per O2. So for 8 O2, it would be 16 Na and 8 O2 → 8 Na2O2. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is O itself, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe B isn't O2. Let's think again about reaction 4. D and B form H, a solvent. If H is ethanol, then D and B might be something like ethylene and water. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol. Then D and B could be CO and H2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe H is ammonia. Then D and B could be N2 and H2. But ammonia is a solvent, though not a common one. Alternatively, maybe H is something else.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about E again. Let's say E has a high symmetry, like D4h or D∞h.

If E is a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like CO2 or O2, then its symmetry is D∞h. So perhaps E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but how would O2 form? Let's see:

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. If E is O2, then D must be something that when reacting with C produces O2. Hmm, but O2 is already an oxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has D∞h symmetry. How would that form?

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2. So what is D? Maybe D is H2O, but that's a solvent. Alternatively, D could be H2S, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like H2O2, which has C2v symmetry. Wait, H2O2 has a structure with two O-H groups connected by an O-O single bond. Its symmetry is C2v because it has a two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, but the options include C2v as an option (option D). So if E is H2O2, then its symmetry would be C2v. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so yes, D∞h symmetry.

But how would Cl2 form from reaction 2? Let's think:

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → Cl2. So D must be something that when reacted with C gives Cl2. Hmm, perhaps D is Cl- source, but I'm not sure.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of each reaction again with possible compounds.

Let me try to consider all reactions together.

Assume that:

- H is H2O (so D and B combine to form H2O).

So reaction 4: D + B → H2O.

Assuming B is O2, then D would be H2, because 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So D is H2, B is O2.

So Reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C.

A is a solid reacting with O2 in a 8:1 ratio. So the formula would be A(O2)_8, but that's a lot of O. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and the oxide has multiple O atoms.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is Fe, and C is FeO4^something. Wait, FeO4^2- is ferrate(VI), which is a strong oxidizer. But I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, perhaps C is FeO(OH), but that's not bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is S (solid), and B is O2. Then S + O2 → SO2 (but that's a gas and not bright red). Alternatively, S + O2 → SO3, but again, not matching.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in 8 equivalents. Let me think about metals and their oxides.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is a strong acid and G a weak acid.

If C is an oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a metal acid and water. For example, if C is a metal oxide, like CaO, then CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a non-metal oxide, like CO2. CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak acid). But that gives only one acid, not two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Let's say C is a sulfide that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is CuS, then CuS + H2O → Cu(OH)2 (which is a base, not acid) and H2S (weak acid). Still, only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it would hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base, not acid). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 (base) + NH3 (weak base). Not acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the products of reaction 3. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces two acids and re-forms A.

So, for example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with H2O (and CO2?) to form Ca(HCO3)2, but that's more about carbonation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. But reacting with water would not produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of compound. Let me think about what produces two different acids when reacted with water.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a polymer. No, that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of C with H2O gives F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). So F could be H2SO4 (if C is a sulfate), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric) and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbide. For example, SiC reacts with H2O to produce HCl and something else? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different type of compound entirely. Let me think about the possibilities again.

Wait, maybe C is a dihydrogen monoxide? No, that's H2O. Not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that C is a chlorate or something else. Or maybe it's a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and another acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, a salt of a diacidic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide that decomposes upon heating, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite and a nitrate? No, that's mixing two things.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that when it reacts with water, it breaks down into two different acids. For example, maybe a mixed anhydride.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce both.

Wait, for example, if C is NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid (stronger than water) but in solution, it can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but that's not producing two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like KHSO3, which would hydrolyze to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and K2SO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about E's structure again. If E has a D4h symmetry, it would be something like a square planar or a molecule with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirrors. Alternatively, a molecule like SO2 has a V shape with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, SO2 has a bent structure with bond angles around 120 degrees, so its symmetry is D∞h. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option B.

Now, let's see if that fits the reactions.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → SO2.

If D is H2S, then perhaps C is something that reacts with H2S in the presence of a catalyst to form SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, but then reaction 2 would be C + O2 → SO2.

Wait, but earlier I thought B is O2 and D is H2. So in reaction 2, C + 2 H2 → SO2. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should adjust. Let me try to assign:

B is O2, D is H2.

Reaction 4: H2 + O2 → H2O (solvent).

Reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red).

So what solid A reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form a bright red product? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in a 8:1 ratio. Let's think about metals and their oxides.

Wait, maybe A is Fe. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO (which is black), Fe3O4 (black), or Fe2O3 (reddish). But Fe2O3 is reddish, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is copper. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black. So that wouldn't fit.

Wait, another metal: maybe it's lead. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps A is not a metal but a non-metal. For example, sulfur. S (solid) + O2 → SO2 (gas), but that's not solid C. Or perhaps S + O2 → SO3, which is a liquid or gas. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, maybe A is manganese. MnO2 is dark brown, but MnO is pink. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is selenium. SeO2 is a solid, but I'm not sure about its color.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a different compound entirely.

Wait, if E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2.

If D is H2, then reaction 2 would be C + H2 → SO2. Not sure what C would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2. Then reaction 2 would be C + O2 → SO2. So if C is S, then reaction would be S + O2 → SO2. But S is a solid, and reaction 1 would involve S + 8 O2 → SO4? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are symmetry groups. If E is O2, symmetry is D∞h. If E is H2O2, symmetry is C2v. If E is CO2, symmetry is D∞h. If E is SO2, symmetry is D∞h.

Wait, the extremely hazardous product E. O2 is essential for life, but in high concentrations, it can be hazardous. SO2 is toxic, as is Cl2. H2O2 is a strong oxidizer and can be hazardous.

If E is SO2, then its symmetry is D∞h. That would be option B.

Now, does the reaction make sense?

Assuming E is SO2.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → SO2.

If D is H2S, then C could be something that when reacts with H2S produces SO2. For example, if C is S, then S + 2 H2S → 3 S + 2 H2O? No, that's not SO2. Alternatively, perhaps C is an oxidizing agent that oxidizes H2S to SO2. For example, if C is KMnO4 in acidic conditions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, and C is S. Then, S + O2 → SO2. But that's a 1:1 ratio, and reaction 2 has 2 D. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the information.

If E is SO2, then its symmetry is D∞h, which is option B.

Alternatively, if E is O2, symmetry is D∞h. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

But in that case, how is O2 formed?

Looking back, reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (O2). So C and D would have to combine to produce O2. But O2 is a diatomic molecule, so perhaps it's formed from some decomposition.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another angle. Let me think about the third reaction again.

C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps A is a metal, and F and G are the corresponding oxyacids.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, for example, say, a high-valent oxide. When it reacts with water, it could produce a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is Na2O2, which is a strong oxidizer. Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2. NaOH is a strong base, not acid. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that reacts with water to produce a strong and weak acid. For example, if C is FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is a base) + H2S (weak acid). But that's only H2S, not two acids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a mixed anhydride, like something that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. But I can't think of a specific example.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water and CO2 to form Ca(HCO3)2. But that's more about carbonation and still gives only one acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. But again, not sure.

Hmm, given the time I've spent and the possible options, I think the correct answer is that E has D∞h symmetry, which is option B.


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of chemical reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a formula like A(B)₈. The bright red color of C hints at a transition metal compound, though no definitive identification of A or B was reached.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The nature of E is critical for determining its symmetry. Options for E include highly hazardous compounds like SO₂, ClF₃, or O₂.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C could be a compound that hydrolyzes to form acids, such as a sulfide or oxide.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water, D and B could be H₂ and O₂, respectively.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- **Option A (C₂)**: This symmetry group corresponds to a molecule with a single two-fold rotation axis. It does not match the likely linear or diatomic nature of E.
- **Option B (D₄h)**: This high-symmetry group includes a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. It is characteristic of molecules like SO₂, which has a bent structure with D₄h symmetry.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: This symmetry group is typical for linear molecules with an infinite axis, such as O₂ or CO₂. While O₂ is a possibility, it does not align well with the reactions described.
- **Option D (C₂v)**: This group includes a two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane. It is characteristic of molecules like H₂O₂, which does not fit the hazardous nature of E.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible candidate for E, based on its hazardous nature and the reactions, is SO₂. SO₂ has a bent structure with D₄h symmetry, making **Option B** the correct answer.

Answer: B
