Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, the problem describes a series of reactions involving several compounds. Let's list out the reactions and see what each step tells me.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red product. I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a reaction where A is something that combines with B in an 8:1 ratio. For example, I remember that sodium reacts with chlorine gas in a 1:1 ratio, but that's not 8. Alternatively, perhaps A is something like aluminum reacting with a gas, but that might not fit the red product.

Wait, bright red makes me think of something like silver nitrate reacting, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming a compound like CuO? Or perhaps a sulfur compound. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain yet.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is the product we're interested in. So, E's structure will determine its molecular symmetry.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So, when C is in water, it's undergoing hydrolysis. If it's producing acids, maybe C is a salt that can hydrolyze into acids. Let's think about that. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, but then what would hydrolysis give? Maybe nitric acid and something else. Or perhaps it's a sulfide? No, sulfides reacting with water might produce H2S and something else, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfite or something similar. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, but upon hydrolysis, it would form a nitrate acid (which is strong) and maybe another acid.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps the hydrolysis of C produces both. For example, if C is ammonium nitrate, but no, that's more of a fertilizer. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt like Zn(NO3)2, which when dissolved in water would produce Zn^2+ and NO3^- ions. But when it reacts with water, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, but nitrate is a strong acid's conjugate base. Hmm, not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Let's think about what D and B could be. If D and B combine 1:1, maybe D is something like O2 or Cl2, but when they react with B, which is a gas, perhaps B is something like H2? No, wait. Or maybe D is H2O and B is something else, but then H would be a solvent.

Wait, let me think about possible gases for B and D. Since D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to make a solvent. Let me think of B as Cl2 gas perhaps? Then D could be something like H2, but then H would be HCl, which is a liquid, but maybe not a solvent. Alternatively, D could be O2 and B could be H2; their reaction would produce H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, but H2O is a solvent. So if D is O2 and B is H2, their reaction would form H2O, which is a solvent. But wait, that would require them to react in a 1:1 ratio. H2 and O2 do react to form H2O in a 2:1 ratio usually, but maybe under certain conditions it's 1:1? Not sure, but perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else.

Wait, but looking back, the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. So, perhaps B is Cl2, and A is sodium. Because sodium reacts with Cl2 in
