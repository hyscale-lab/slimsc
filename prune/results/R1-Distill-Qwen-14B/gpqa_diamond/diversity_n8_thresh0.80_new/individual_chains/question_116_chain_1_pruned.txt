Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, like maybe from a CH2 group next to another CH2. The quartet would mean each proton is adjacent to three others, perhaps a CH group next to a CH2.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So total 10 hydrogens. Wait, but in an NMR, the sum of the areas under the peaks gives the number of protons. 6 +4=10H. Hmm, but I think the molecule might have more hydrogens because maybe some are equivalent or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait no, maybe the molecule is something like a di-substituted alkane.

Wait, another thought: if we have a triplet at 0.9, which is usually a methyl group (CH3) next to a CH2. Because a CH3 next to a CH2 would be a quartet, but wait no, wait. Let me think again. For a CH3 group, if it's adjacent to a CH2, each of the CH3 protons would see the two protons on the adjacent CH2, so the CH3 would be a triplet. Wait no, wait. The splitting is based on neighboring non-equivalent protons. So a CH3 next to a CH2 would have each of its protons split by the two protons on the CH2. But wait, each CH3 proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons on the neighboring CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet for the CH3. And the CH2 would be a quartet because each of their protons is adjacent to three (from the CH3 group). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the CH3 group has 3H. The adjacent CH2 has 2H. So the CH3 would split into a quartet? Because each H on CH3 is next to 2H on CH2. Wait, no, wait. The splitting is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring equivalent protons. So for the CH3 group, each H is next to 2H on the CH2, so that would be a triplet (n=2, so 3 peaks). And the CH2 group, each H is next to 3H (the CH3), so that would be a quartet (n=3, four peaks). 

So the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two CH3 groups, each with 3H. Because 2*3=6. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests two CH2 groups, each with 2H. So 2*2=4. So that makes sense. So the structure must have two CH3 groups and two CH2 groups. How?

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2. No, that doesn't sum up. Wait, maybe it's a di-sub
