Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, and the question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, so the complex is in solution at 0.02 M concentration. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula for the formation constant K would be [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = K.

But wait, in this case, the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, all the species present is the complex. It dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (since EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form when it's deprotonated enough to bind metals, especially at the given ideal pH).

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as CaY²- (since EDTA is usually Y^4- and Ca²+ has +2 charge, so overall charge of CaY²- would be 2-).

When it dissociates, it would go into Ca²+ and Y^4-. But wait, in solution, the CaY²- would dissociate as Ca²+ + Y^4-.

Wait, but the formation constant K is given. So K is the formation constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-; K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But in this problem, the solution is made by dissolving the CaY²- complex. So the initial concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. Let me model the dissociation.

Let’s call the concentration of Ca²+ as x and the concentration of Y^4- as x as well, assuming that some of the complex dissociates. Wait, actually, maybe not? Because the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-.

Wait, the total concentration of all species related to calcium and EDTA must be considered. The total concentration is the sum of the complex and the free ions. But for a very strong complex (high K), the dissociation is minimal. Since K is 5e10, that's a very large K, meaning the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So x would be very small compared to 0.02.

But I should set up the equation properly. Let me consider the dissociation:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

Let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Then the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, because each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of each ion. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since x is very small (because K is large), 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So according to the formation constant K:

K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

So K = 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, 2/5 is 0.4, right. So x² = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, since (1e-6.5)^2 is 1e-13.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, because 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. I assumed that the concentration of CaY²- is approximately 0.02 because x is very small. That makes sense because K is so large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much.

So the free calcium ion concentration is about 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The total concentration of the complex is approximately \(0.02 - x \), but since \(x\) is very small (due to the large \(K\)), we approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.

Answer: C
