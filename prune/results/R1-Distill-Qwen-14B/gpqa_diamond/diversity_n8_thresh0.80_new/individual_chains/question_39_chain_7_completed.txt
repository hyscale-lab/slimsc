Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about wave functions and normalization. Hmm. I remember that wave functions need to be normalized, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because that represents the total probability of finding the particle somewhere.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe I should write it as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a complex wave function. Oh right, wave functions can be complex, but when we calculate probabilities, we take the complex conjugate and multiply.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the wave function correctly. The real part is a / sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5) * i.

But wait, no. Actually, the way the function is written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, which would be a real part plus imaginary part. So yes, it's a complex function.

Now, the problem states that when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. So our wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given expression in between.

But wait, wait. The wave function as given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps that's only the part between x=1 and x=3. Because outside, the wave function is zero, which isn't the same as the given expression. So the particle exists only between 1 and3, the rest is zero.

So the wave function is zero outside [1,3], and inside, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². The absolute square of a complex number is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + (-0.5i). So, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), the imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of this should be 1.

So the integral becomes ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals: a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x) + C. Evaluated from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫dx from 1 to3 is 2 (since 3-1=2). So the second term is 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) approximately is 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a² ≈ 0.721, so a ≈ sqrt(0.721).

What's sqrt(0.721)?

Let me think. 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Oh, wait! So sqrt(0.721) is approximately 0.85, because 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is very close to 0.721.

So a is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized. This means the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

1. Compute \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} dx \):
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x} \) is \( \ln(1 + x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. Compute \( \int_1^3 dx \):
   This is simply \( 3 - 1 = 2 \).

Substituting these results back, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
