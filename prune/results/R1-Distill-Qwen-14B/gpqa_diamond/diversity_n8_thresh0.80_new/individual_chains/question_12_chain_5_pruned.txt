Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of a Pi(+) into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, so that simplifies things a bit because I don't have to worry about initial momentum in that direction right away. 

Wait, the rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is usually considered negligible, right? So I can treat it as massless. That makes things a bit easier because then the energy calculations might be simpler.

So, I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, the neutrino's mass is zero, so its momentum is just p, and the muon's momentum is also p but opposite in direction. Or maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

But wait, since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum (because E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4, and m=0, so E = pc). But the muon has a rest mass, so its energy is sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4). 

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c^2. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the vector sum of the muon's and neutrino's momenta must be zero. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p (vector), and the neutrino's as -p (vector). So p_mu = p, p_nu = -p.

But wait, the neutrino's momentum is opposite to the muon's, so the magnitudes are the same, but directions are opposite.

So, the energy of the muon is E_mu =
