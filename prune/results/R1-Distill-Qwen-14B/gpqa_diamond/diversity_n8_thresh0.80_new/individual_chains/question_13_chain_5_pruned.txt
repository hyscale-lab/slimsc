Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-limonene. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll take it slow.

First, the starting material is (R)-limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic compound, I think. Oh right, it's a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. It has a structure similar to a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic monoterpene with a menthane-like structure. Oh wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.

So the first reaction is treating this with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like hydrogenation. Since Pd/C is a catalyst used for hydrogenation, especially for alkenes. So limonene has a double bond, and hydrogenation would add hydrogen across it.

But wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but when hydrogenated, the double bond would be saturated. So the product after hydrogenation would be the hydrogenated version of limonene, which I think is called... let me think. Oh, limonene upon hydrogenation gives dihydrolimonene or something like that. Wait, wait, limonene is a bicyclic structure. So the hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond. So the product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene.

Wait, but the question says that one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So the starting limonene has one double bond. So after adding one equivalent of H2, the double bond becomes a single bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a cyclohexane derivative, perhaps? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but I think it's a bicyclo structure. Let me think: the structure of limonene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So product 1 would
