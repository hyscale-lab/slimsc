Alright, so I've got this problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about finding the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, let's think about what I know.

First, I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity. It's often represented as f(θ), which has a real part and an imaginary part. The imaginary part is particularly important because it relates to the loss of particles or the cross-sections.

Wait, the question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude can be expressed as a sum over these partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving the phase shift δ_l. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l of ( (2l + 1) * [ sin(δ_l) / (1 - cos δ_l) ) ] * P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. That means θ is 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle is 0. So, when θ approaches 0, cosθ approaches 1. Which Legendre polynomial term would dominate here?

Legendre polynomials. I remember P₀(x) is 1, P₁ is x, P₂ is (3x² -1)/2, etc. So when x approaches 1, P₀(1) = 1, P₁(1) = 1, P₂(1) = (3(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, so wait, P₂(1) is 1 as well. Hmm, but wait, maybe not. Let me think again. For higher l, as θ approaches 0, the value of P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l, right? Because when x=1, all Legendre poly evaluates to 1, I think.

Wait, but the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) / (k) ) * [ (sin δ_l) / (1 - cos δ_l) ) ] * P_l(cosθ). So when θ is 0,
