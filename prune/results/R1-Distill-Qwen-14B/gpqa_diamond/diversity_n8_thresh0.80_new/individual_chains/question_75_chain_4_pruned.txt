Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The goal was to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They did this by modifying the GADD45G gene to include a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then, they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

The plus strand sequence provided starts with the ATG (which is the start codon) and ends with TGA, which I think is a stop codon because TGA is one of the three possible stop codons (the others are TAG and TAA). So looking at the end of the coding sequence, the last few codons would be ...GGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, actually, the sequence ends with TGA. Let me parse that. So the sequence is 5' to 3', so the last part is ...GAGTGA. So when transcribed into mRNA, the mRNA would have the sequence ...CUGAGUA. Wait no, DNA is 5'->3'; mRNA is complementary, so the mRNA would be ...AUCAGUA. Hmm, wait, the DNA is plus strand 5' ... GAGTGA ... so the mRNA would be complementary: CUCAGUA. Wait, no, because mRNA is made from the template strand. The coding sequence is on the plus strand, so the mRNA is same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the DNA, except T→U. Wait, no, actually, DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA (except T→U), so the DNA plus strand includes the coding sequence. So the mRNA would be a copy of the plus strand, replacing T with U.

So the mRNA would have the stop codon as UAG. Wait no, let me think again. The DNA has a stop codon in the plus strand as TGA. That would mean the mRNA would have UAG as the stop codon. Because the DNA is plus strand 5' to 3' is ATG ... TGA. So the mRNA, which is made from the template (the complementary strand), would be AUC ... AUC for the start, and the last codon would be UAG. Wait, no, because the DNA plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T becomes U. So the DNA sequence for the coding region is ATG ... TGA (the stop codon). So the mRNA is AUG ... UAG. So the stop codon is UAG. But wait, the options are about why the protein isn't being expressed. So the question is, why isn't the protein being made correctly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but if the coding sequence is correct, the protein would still be made. Unless it's causing a frameshift or a premature stop, but the stop codon is at the end here. But the sequence given doesn't show any frameshift or mutation in the HA tag.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. But looking at the provided sequence, the stop codon is TGA, which is at the very end. So the coding sequence doesn't have any other stop codons before, so the ribosome should proceed until the end. Unless the HA tag introduces a stop somewhere.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA-GADD45G. So the coding sequence should start with the HA sequence, followed by GADD45G. The HA tag is a small peptide, usually around 11 amino acids. So perhaps the introduced HA sequence has a stop codon in it? Let me check the DNA sequence.

Wait, the first part of the DNA is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So the start codon is ATG, then TAC is Tyr, then CCA is Pro, then TAC is Tyr again, etc. So the HA tag is probably that initial part. The HA tag is a short sequence, maybe 11 amino acids, which in DNA is about 33 nucleotides (since each codon is 3 nt). The given sequence starts with ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCG
