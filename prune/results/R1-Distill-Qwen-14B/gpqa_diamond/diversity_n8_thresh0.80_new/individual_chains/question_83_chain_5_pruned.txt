Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. So, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction, producing water and the acetate ion.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³. So:

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 20 cm³; V2 = 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.0125 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration part. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So I need to calculate both.

Let me think about each part separately.

First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So for equivalence, moles of NaOH added must be equal to moles of CH3COOH initially present.

So let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Volume of diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Molarity is 0.0125 M.

Moles = Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 moles.

So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added will be 0.0005 moles.

Now, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume V used is moles / concentration = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait—no, because the initial solution is 40 cm³, and I'm adding some volume of NaOH. But wait, wait, how much NaOH is needed for equivalence. Let me recalculate.

Wait, moles of acetic acid = 0.0125 M * 0.04 L = 0.0005 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.0005 mol. Volume of NaOH solution needed is 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³. So at equivalence point, 5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem doesn't directly ask about the equivalence volume, but rather what happens at the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the solution will consist of the sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na^+). Since NaOH is a strong base, it will dissociate completely, and the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

So the solution at equivalence point will be a solution of sodium acetate
