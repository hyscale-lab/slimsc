Okay, so I've got this question here about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast, and I need to figure out which protein complex won't show up much in the assay. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: someone identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in Lactobacillus acidophilus. They treated yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with this peptide and noticed the formation of a shmoo. Shmoo formation is a response in yeast, right? I remember that shmoo cells are usually indicative of the mating response. So when yeast cells are treated with certain pheromones, they form this structure called a shmoo, which is part of their mating process.

So the next part is about doing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry to study the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. The question is asking which protein complex will be the least present in this assay. The options are A to D.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Nucleosome histone complex. Well, nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, made up of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped. Since chromatin structure is involved, I'd assume histones are present. So this complex is likely to be there.

Option B: Pre-replication complex. This complex is involved in DNA replication, marking origins of replication and getting things ready for S phase. If the yeast are in the shmoo stage, which is a mating response, maybe they're not actively replicating DNA. So I'm not sure, but perhaps this complex wouldn't be active in the chromatin being studied here.

Option C: Pre-initiation complex. This is related to the initiation of transcription. Proteins like RNA polymerase II and transcription factors assemble here to start transcription. Since the shmoo involves changes in gene expression, especially mating-related genes, this complex might be present.

Option D: Enhancer protein complex. Enhancers are regions of DNA that help increase the transcription of genes. Proteins like transcription factors bound to enhancers might be part of the chromatin in active regions. So I’d expect some presence here.

Wait, but the question is about the least observed complex. If the assay is looking at active chromatin, perhaps pre-replication complexes are not involved in active transcription or chromatin regions that are being transcribed. Alternatively, during the shmoo formation, which is a response to pheromones, the yeast cells are probably in a G1 phase and not preparing to replicate DNA. So the pre-replication complex (which is needed for DNA replication) might not be active, hence not present in the chromatin immunoprecipitated in this assay.

Alternatively, considering the active chromatin regions – pre-initiation complexes (C) are part of the transcription machinery. So they would be present in regions where genes are being transcribed. The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which occurs in S phase, so maybe it's not active in this scenario.

So, looking for the least present, it's probably the pre-replication complex. So the correct answer would be option B.


The question involves identifying the least observed protein complex in the active chromatin of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with a quorum-sensing peptide, leading to shmoo formation. Shmoo formation is associated with the yeast mating response, which involves changes in gene expression but not DNA replication. The assay focuses on active chromatin, so the presence of protein complexes related to transcription or chromatin structure is expected.

- **Option A: Nucleosome histone complex**  
  Nucleosomes are fundamental components of chromatin and are always present in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. This complex is likely to be observed.

- **Option B: Pre-replication complex**  
  This complex is involved in DNA replication, marking replication origins, and preparing for S phase. Since the shmoo formation is a mating response and not directly linked to DNA replication, this complex is unlikely to be active in the chromatin being studied.

- **Option C: Pre-initiation complex**  
  This complex is involved in the initiation of transcription, including RNA polymerase II and transcription factors. Given that the shmoo involves mating-related gene expression, this complex is likely to be present.

- **Option D: Enhancer protein complex**  
  Enhancers are regions of DNA that regulate gene expression, and proteins bound to enhancers are expected in active chromatin. This complex is likely to be observed.

Since the assay focuses on active chromatin during shmoo formation, the pre-replication complex, which is associated with DNA replication, is the least likely to be observed. 

Answer: B
