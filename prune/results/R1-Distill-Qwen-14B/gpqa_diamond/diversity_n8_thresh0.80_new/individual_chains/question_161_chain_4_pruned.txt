Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

So Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by causing scattering or something.

But even after doing all that, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them, so Mike knows they're present. He calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So factors like pressure, temperature, and the compartment's volume would affect λ1, the mean free path he found.

Then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices something different. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature hasn't changed, so that can't be the reason. Now, the question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

Wait, mean free path... I remember that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure. Oh, but wait, pressure is lower in higher vacuums, which means the mean free path is longer. Because if there's less pressure (fewer gas molecules), the molecules don't collide as often, so they travel further before a collision.

But in this case, the initial setup was already at ultra-high vacuum. So the pressure is very low. Then, when the electron beam is on, Mike detects a change in the mean free path. So what's causing that change?

I think when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving at a high speed. The gas molecules are still present, but perhaps the electrons interact with them. Wait, the mean free path is about the gas molecules' movement, but when the electrons are there, maybe the gas molecules are scattering the electrons more?

Wait, no. The mean free path in this context refers to the gas molecules, right? Because Mike is looking at electron scattering due to gas molecules. So the electron beam is being scattered by the gas particles, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The mean free path of the gas molecules in the vacuum is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps it ionizes some of the gas molecules. Or maybe the electron
