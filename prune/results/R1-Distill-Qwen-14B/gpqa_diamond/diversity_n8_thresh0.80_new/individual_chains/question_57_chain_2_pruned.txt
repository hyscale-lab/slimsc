Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, phase shifts are important for calculating the scattering amplitude. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula involves the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts, right? So for each l, we have a term involving δ_l.

The general formula I recall is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) * exp(iδ_l) * sin((l + 1)θ) ) / sinθ ). But wait, when we're looking along the incident beam direction, θ would be zero degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. When you're along the beam direction, the scattering angle θ is 0, but wait, I think that when θ is 0, sinθ is zero, so maybe that's problematic. Or perhaps the formula is evaluated in a different way for forward scattering.

Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the beam) relates to the sum of the phase shifts. Oh wait, here's another thought: the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. So, the imaginary part of f(0) is (k/(4π)) multiplied by the total cross-section σ.

But wait, how does that help me here? The problem gives me phase shifts δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, etc. So maybe I should compute the sum of exp(iδ_l) for each l, and then find the imaginary part. But wait, the question is only considering the first few phase shifts. Oh, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ_4. So I think I should consider l=0 to l=4.

Let me write down the given phase shifts:

δ_0 = 90°, which is π/2 radians.
δ_1 = 67°, which is approximately 1.17 radians.
δ_2 = 55°, about 0.9599 radians.
δ_3 = 30°, about 0.5236 radians.
δ_4 = 13
