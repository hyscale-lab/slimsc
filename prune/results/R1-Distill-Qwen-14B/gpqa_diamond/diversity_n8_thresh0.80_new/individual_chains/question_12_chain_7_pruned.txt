Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let's see what we've got.

The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. The masses given are the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are almost massless, so their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So the neutrino's mass can be considered zero for this calculation.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products after decay must be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude to the muon's.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Oh right, because the rest mass energy is part of their total energy, and kinetic energy is the extra part.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So initial energy E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy E_mu is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy E_nu is just its kinetic energy, because its rest mass is zero.

So, E_mu + E_nu = E_initial.

But wait, because the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = |p_nu| c, and since momentum is conserved, |p_mu| = |p_nu|. So p_mu = p_nu, but in opposite directions.

So, the muon's energy would be sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units can be a bit tricky here. Let's think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, which is common in particle physics.
