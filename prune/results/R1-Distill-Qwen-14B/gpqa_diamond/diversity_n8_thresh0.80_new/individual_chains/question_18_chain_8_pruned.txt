Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm. Let's see what I remember from my studies. 

The question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances. The important part is the [X/Y] notation, which I remember is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. 

So the given data is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = about 3.16e-5.
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So, [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], but wait, no. Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So it's n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But wait, how do I get n_Si for each star?

Let me think about the abundance ratios. Remember that [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun. So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_Sun )

So, for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 = log( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) )
Similarly, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1 / n_H1 )
