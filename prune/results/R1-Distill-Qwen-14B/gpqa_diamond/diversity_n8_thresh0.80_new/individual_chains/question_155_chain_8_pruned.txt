Okay, so I have this problem about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a system in a specific state. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided in matrix form. 

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That's important because the state we're given is expressed in this basis, I think. So the state is already in the P_z eigenbasis, which might make things easier.

So, uncertainty in P_z... I remember that the uncertainty ΔA is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, what's the expectation value of P_z?

Wait, no, the state is given, and it's an eigenstate of P_x, but the operators P_x, P_y, P_z might not commute. So to find ΔP_z, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Then, take their difference, take the square root, and that will give me the uncertainty.

Let me write down the given state ψ. It's a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2,
        1/√2,
        -1/2 ]

Wait, but to be precise,
