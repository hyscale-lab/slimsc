Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which I remember has a strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1. So the molecule has an -O-CO-O- group or maybe an ester like R-O-CO-R'. Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R', so the carbonyl would be around 1740, and the ester oxygen maybe around 1100-1250 for the C-O stretch. 

Then, looking at the 1H NMR data. Six signals in total. Let me break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns, like para, ortho, or meta. If it's para, there are two equivalent H's (for each pair), but wait, wait, if the ring is di-substituted, the number of unique aromatic protons depends on the substituents and their positions.

Wait, the question says two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. That suggests that the substituents split the ring into two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. The aromatic protons would then be in two sets of two each, but if the substituents are different, maybe they're in a positions that create two different environments. Alternatively, if the substituent is such that the ring has two types of Hs. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. A vinyl group is CH2=CH-, but wait, the NMR shows two signals: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. Wait, vinyl protons are the protons on a double bond. So, maybe the molecule has a conjugated system, like a styrene group or something similar. 

Wait, but if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's an ester attached to a vinyl group. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group and another substituent that has a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen or something else. Or perhaps the substituents are both ester-related. Hmm.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. A vinyl group typically has two sets of protons (cis and trans, but in a simple case, maybe they are in different environments). For example, if the vinyl group is part of an ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, but connected in a way that leads to two different vinyl protons.

Wait, the vinyl Hs are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about that. A vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) would have two protons. If the protons are adjacent to the double bond, they might couple with each other. So the H's on the CH2 would each be next to another H on the adjacent CH. So each would be a doublet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps with another group. Alternatively, maybe one of the vinyl Hs is coupled with more than one neighbor.

Wait, the vinyl H signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps one proton is split into a doublet (coupled with one proton), and another is a doublet of quartets, which would mean it's coupled with two different sets of protons. Hmm. That could happen if, for example, the vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester, and the protons are in a more complex coupling situation.

Wait, another thought: The two vinyl H signals could be because the substituent is a vinyl ester group. For example, maybe the substituent is an ester where the oxygen is connected to a vinyl group. So the structure might be something like O-CO-OCH2CH2-..., no, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached, like O-CO-CH2CH2-... No, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached directly to the oxygen. Like O-CO-O-CH2CH2-O-? No, maybe it's an ester like O-CO-O-CH2CH2-, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CH-O-CO-R. So the benzene ring has an ester group (like -O-CO-OR') and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- attached elsewhere). 

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. So perhaps one substituent is an ester (R-O-CO-R), and the other is a vinyl group attached via another atom, like maybe it's a styrene group attached as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl substituent. But how would that affect the NMR?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, etc. For a di-substituted benzene (which has 3 double bonds, so 4 degrees of unsaturation from benzene). Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's do that for each option:

Option A) C11H14O2: 2*11 +2 -14 = 24 -14 =10. 10/2=5 degrees.
But benzene already contributes 4 (3 double bonds plus one ring). So substituents contribute 1 degree. Which could be, for example, a double bond (like an ester, which has a carbonyl group). So that's possible.

Option B) C12H14O2: 2*12+2 -14 =26-14=12. 12/2=6. Benzene (4) + substituents (2). So substituents could be two double bonds, like two ester groups? Or one double bond and a ring, but not sure.

Option C) C12H12O2: 2*12+2 -12 =26-12=14. 14/2=7. So benzene (4) + substituents (3). Hmm, but di-substituted, so substituents would have 3 degrees? Maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like ester) and another has a ring or another double bond.

Wait, but the substituents are only two, so each substituent can contribute to degrees of unsaturation. For example, if one substituent is an ester (which is a
