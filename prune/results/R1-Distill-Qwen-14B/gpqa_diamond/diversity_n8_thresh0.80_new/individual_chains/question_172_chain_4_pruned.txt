Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is usually something like n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the energy difference is given. Let's call the two energy levels E1 and E2. The energy difference Î”E is E2 - E1, which is 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the way the question is phrased, I think the excitation is higher in star_1. So, more atoms are in the higher energy level in star_1 than in star_2.

So, in star_1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as n1 and for star_2 as n2. So n1 = 2 * n2, maybe? Or wait, no. The problem says the excitation is twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of excited to lower state is twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me re-read the question. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the level in star_1 is twice as populated as the same level in star_2. So for each star, we have the same energy levels, but the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Oh, perhaps. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the excitation energy is twice as much? No, the problem says the energy difference is given, so that's fixed.

Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy
