Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The given temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which is the second deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. So phosphate ions come from HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. H3PO4 can lose protons in three steps:
1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the third dissociation step. But wait, in a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, what's happening here? Those are two different salts, so it's probably a buffer solution.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate (but I think the 2H2O is just the formula, so when dissolved, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Oh wait, but in solution, these can interconvert because they're in a buffer system.

So the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The presence of both these ions indicates that the solution is a buffer, and the pH should be around the pKa2 of H3PO4, since that's the second dissociation step.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is from HPO4^2- losing another proton. But in this buffer, would that be significant? Because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way smaller than Ka2 which is 6.2e-8). So PO4^3- would be minimal in this solution.

But wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). So perhaps I should consider the third dissociation.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is considering the phosphate ion from the Na2HPO4. Hmm, no. Wait, Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2- in solution, not PO4^3-.

So the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, the HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- and water. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be governed by the third dissociation constant.

But how much of that is present?

I think I can model this using the third dissociation. The concentration of HPO4^2- comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the KH2PO4 because H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- already, so maybe they form a buffer, but any PO4^3- would come from the further deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Determine the total concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is around pKa2. But wait, the presence of both salts affects the pH. But perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the third dissociation.

The third dissociation equation is:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So, PO4^3- concentration can be found if we know [H+] and [HPO4^2-].

But in this solution, the pH is determined by the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around pKa2.

Wait, pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is about 7.21. Because Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So in the solution, pH is around 7.21, which is the pKa2. So [H+] is around 6.2e-8 M.

Wait, but if the solution is buffered, the [H+] can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, in a buffer solution, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). In this case, the buffer is H2PO4^- (HA) and HPO4^2- (A-), so the pKa is pKa2 (7.21).

So, [A-] is [HPO4^2-], and [HA] is [H2PO4^-].

So first, I need to compute the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Wait, but the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So let me calculate the moles contributed by each.

Molar masses:

KH2PO4: Mw = 136.09 g/mol.
So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007347 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw = 177.99 g/mol.
So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O on dissociation gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So for each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O, we get one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So in the solution, the moles of H2PO4^- are approximately 0.007347 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005615 mol.

But wait, the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.036735 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028075 M.

So now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for this buffer:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.028075 / 0.036735)

Calculating the ratio:
