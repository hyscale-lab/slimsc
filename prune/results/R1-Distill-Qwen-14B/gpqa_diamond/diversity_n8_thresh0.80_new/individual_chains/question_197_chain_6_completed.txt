Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided are IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which might indicate an O-H stretch or an N-H, but since it's followed by 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak, I'm thinking it's an ester or a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually broader and around 2500-3300 cm-1. The 1720 peak is more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be more prominent. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. Let me look at the NMR.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but that's usually even broader and might be around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is for 1H. So could be either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. Hmm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually broad because of the O-H exchange. Alternatively, an aldehyde is usually a triplet if near an electronegative group, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm. Not sure yet. Let's see the other signals.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. Because if it's a benzene ring with substituents, the substituents can cause the ring protons to shift. Since the protons are split into two doublets, likely a para-substituted structure. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in the para positions, but wait, each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents, but in this case, the two substituents could be in the para positions, leading to two doublets. So for example, a para-substituted benzene with two identical substituents? Or maybe a substituent that causes the ring to have two sets of doublets.

Looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet for 1H. Maybe a CH near an electronegative group or adjacent to a carbonyl. Or perhaps part of a CH group in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet of two protons. Maybe adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone or ester.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. Wait, no, a doublet with integration 3H. So maybe a CH(CH3) group where the CH is split into a doublet due to coupling with nearby protons. Like a CH attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, the doublet is for the methyl? Or the proton attached to it. Wait, maybe it's a geminal coupling but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group next to a CH which has coupling. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group, like a CH2-CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let me try to sketch possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

That would imply a phenyl group attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-COOH. Wait, but the substituents would be at position 4 on the phenyl. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be: the phenyl group is attached to the ethyl group at position 4, and then attached to the propanoic acid at position 2. Hmm, but not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so 1 and 4 are para positions. So it's para-xylene with an isobutyl group? No, wait, benzene is a ring, so 1 and 4 positions are across from each other. So 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene would have an isobutyl group in position 1 and methyl in 4. But that's a possibility.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CO2H, but wait, sec-butyl is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2) attached. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a substituent at position 4 on the benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group. That would make it a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, one being a methyl and the other a sec-butyl.

Now, considering the IR data. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl. But in option C, benzoic acid has a carbonyl, but the IR for a carboxylic acid usually has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present here. But the question is, what about the reaction conditions? The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe another reaction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts alkyl halides to acids. Alternatively, HI in presence of red phosphorus is used to cleave ethers, but another possibility is the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, no, perhaps it's the cleavage of a benzyl group. Wait, another thought: when a benzyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes elimination. Alternatively, I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about what this reaction is. Oh yes, red phosphorus and HI is a mixture that can be used to cleave benzylic halides. Wait, but if X has a benzylic halide, then it would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, maybe. Alternatively, if X is an allylic halide, it might undergo elimination. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another reaction: the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HgCl2, but that's for ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, when an alkyl halide is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the formation of an acid. Wait, for example, in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a benzyl ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a benzyl ester, say RCOOCH2Ph, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze it to RCOOH and something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me go back to the NMR of X. So in the NMR, the downfield shift at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad) could be a carboxylic acid proton. So if X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not make much sense. Unless... wait, no, if X is a benzyl ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would cleave the ester. For instance, if X is a methyl benzoate, then reacting with HI and P would give benzoic acid and methyl iodide. But wait, the reaction conditions might be more specific.

Alternatively, suppose X is an aryl ketone. Then, with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of cleavage. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures and see which would fit the NMR and IR data.

Looking back at the NMR:

The broad peak at 10.5 ppm (1H) suggests a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR should have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. The given IR does show 3400–2500 cm-1, which might include an O-H stretch. So if that's the case, the carbonyl at 1720 is from the carboxylic acid. But wait, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 could be possible. Alternatively, an ester or ketone has higher wavenumbers. So maybe an ester.

Wait, but the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These could be C=C stretching, like in an aromatic ring. So that makes sense for a benzene ring.

So, putting it together, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent and a side chain.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group attached at the para position.

But let me look at the NMR of X again. The 10.5 ppm is a proton for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are at 8 and 7.2, which are para to each other, so the substituent is in the para position. Then, the substituent would have a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4, which is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the substituent's NMR. The substituent is sec-butyl, which would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). The CH2 groups would show up as multiplets.

Looking at the NMR of X, the signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Perhaps the CH next to the CH(CH3) group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): The two CH2 groups in the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is (CH2)2CH(CH3)? No, wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene? No, wait, no. Wait the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, that's iso-butyl. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of sec-butyl.

Butyl groups have four carbons. The position of substitution determines the name. For sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, but that's five carbons. No.

Wait, the correct structure is:

The butyl group has four carbons. The sec position is the second carbon in the chain. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think of the substituent as:

The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's iso-butyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent in option C as a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to think of the NMR signals for a sec-butyl group. The substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. Hmm, wait, no, for a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3), the NMR would have protons in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene with a substituent at para position which is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, but that would make it a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), which would be a three-carbon substituent.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet. So, perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, let me think again about substituent structure.

The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

Ph—CH2—CH(CH3)— ?

Wait, no, the substituent would be a four-carbon group. Let me count: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to benzene? No, that can't be right because that would be a five-carbon group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So, benzene attached to CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR signals again.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet. That's typical for a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to another CH with coupling. So, perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? Hmm, but that's four carbons (CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-), but the substituent would be a butyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH next to the CH(CH3). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two CH2 groups adjacent to this structure.

Let me consider the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an iso-butyl group. Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2- attached to the benzene. So the NMR would show a methyl group (CH3) as a singlet, but in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests it's attached to a CH group.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. The substituent's structure would be such that it has a branching, leading to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group? No, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, perhaps from an ethyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the middle CH2 groups, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH next to the branching point.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's five carbons, which seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: if the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2, then the NMR would show a CH2 group, perhaps as the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and the CH(CH3)2 as the 1.4 ppm (d,3H). Wait, that might fit. Because the CH(CH3)2 would have a methyl group as a doublet, but no, that's a singlet usually. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR for a sec-butyl group attached to a benzene ring. The structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? No, that's more than four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So it's CH2CH(CH3)2. Then the NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (position 2.9 ppm, m, 1H).

- The CH(CH3)2 group would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups. Wait, but in the given NMR, there's a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which suggests a single methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2- something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think of the substituent as -CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. That would make the substituent a sec-propyl group, but that's not a standard terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, that's a four-carbon group, so maybe that's a butyl group.

But I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me try to think about the reaction. X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. What reaction conditions are these?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, another thought: the presence of HI and red phosphorus can lead to the cleavage of a benzyl ester. For example, if X is a benzyl ester, like RCOOCH2Ph, then treating with HI and red phosphorus would cleave the ester to form RCOOH and PhCH2I. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, another reaction: when a benzyl group is attached to a carbonyl, such as in benzaldehyde, treatment with HI and red phosphorus might lead to cleavage. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI leads to a product. So, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and upon reaction, the ester is cleaved to a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X were the ester of this acid, perhaps methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride or bromide, and the reaction is elimination. But that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, the IR of X has a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1. If that's an ester, then the reaction would cleave the ester. So, X might be an ester with a benzyl group.

Let me imagine X is methyl benzoate with a substituent. For example, maybe it's something like methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cleave the ester to give 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

So, the reaction of an ester with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze the ester to the carboxylic acid. That makes sense. Because red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters to acids, especially in the Hunsdiecker reaction conditions.

So, if X is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would make sense if X were the ester, say, methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

But let me check the NMR of X. The ester would have a carbonyl group, which would show up at around 1720 cm-1 (which matches the IR). The ester would also have an OCH3 group, which would typically show up around 3.8 ppm as a triplet (if adjacent to CH3), but in the NMR data provided, there's no such signal. Wait, the NMR data doesn't show a singlet around 3.8 ppm, which would be expected for an OCH3 group in an ester.

Hmm, maybe X isn't an ester then. Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. The IR would have a strong C=O around 1720 cm-1, which matches a ketone.

If X is a ketone, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not cleave it. Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde. The NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. But in the given data, the peak is at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if X is an aldehyde, say, phenylacetaldehyde (PhCH2CHO), then the NMR would have an aldehyde proton around 9.5-10.5 ppm, which matches the given data. But then the IR would show a strong peak around 1720 cm-1, which would correspond to the aldehyde's C=O. But wait, an aldehyde's C=O is around 1720 cm-1, so that fits. However, the aromatic region in the NMR would have protons in a certain pattern. In the given data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, if X is PhCH2CHO, the aromatic part would be a monosubstituted benzene, but the NMR shows two sets of doublets, which suggests a disubstituted ring, perhaps para.

Wait, but if X is a para-substituted benzaldehyde derivative, like p-tolualdehyde (4-methylbenzaldehyde), then the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, which matches the NMR. But then the substituent would be a methyl group, and the aldehyde would be at the para position. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a single proton, which fits the aldehyde. But then the other signals (like the 2.9 ppm) wouldn't match. Because in p-tolualdehyde, the structure is Ph-CH3 with the aldehyde at the para position, but wait, no, the aldehyde would be attached directly to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CHO, which is benzaldehyde, but that would have a monosubstituted ring, leading to a different pattern in the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think again about the reaction. X is treated with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a benzyl ester, like methyl benzoate with substituents, then the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. So the product would be the corresponding acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be the product if X was methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

But then, the NMR of X would have the OCH3 group of the ester. But in the given NMR, there is no such peak. So maybe X isn't an ester.

Wait, another possibility: X is a propyl benzoate or some other ester, but without the OCH3 in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a different type, like an isopropyl ester, but then the NMR would have a septet around 1.2 ppm for the isopropyl group, which isn't present here.

Another angle: The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid. The 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H or N-H stretch. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit, but then the aldehyde proton in the NMR would not make sense.

Wait, if X is a benzophenone derivative, the IR would have the C=O of a ketone. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1, so that's unlikely.

Wait, let me think of the possible structure again. The NMR shows a downfield shift for 1H at 10.5 ppm, which is likely either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. The 1720 IR peak fits both. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be broad, which it is (3400–2500 cm-1). So X could be a carboxylic acid.

But then, why would X react with red phosphorus and HI? That doesn't seem right, because carboxylic acids typically don't react under such conditions. So perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but another compound.

Wait, another possibility: X is a benzyl chloride. The IR would have a C=O if it's an ester, but without the ester peak, maybe it's a benzyl chloride. But how would that fit with the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde, like 4-ethylbenzaldehyde. Then, the NMR would have an aldehyde proton at 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be as two doublets (para substitution). The substituent would be an ethyl group, which would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm (the CH2CH3 group) and a quartet around 4 ppm (the CH2 group attached to the ring). But in the given NMR, the substituent signals are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That fits a butyl group.

Wait, so if X is 4-(propyl)benzaldehyde, but that doesn't match the substituent. Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-ethylbenzaldehyde. But then the substituent would be ethyl, which would have a triplet at 1.4 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4 ppm (CH2). But the given NMR doesn't have a quartet; instead, there's a 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 ppm (m,2H). Hmm, that's more like a branching in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let's say it's an iso-propyl group. Then, the NMR would show a septet for the CH(CH3)2 group, but that's not present here. Alternatively, it's a butyl group with branching.

Looking at the substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): Two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): A methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): A terminal methyl group.

This suggests a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a butyl group. But wait, the substituent is branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. But wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, that's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. But then, how would that look?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. No, that would be an iso-butyl group.

Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a methyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group as a triplet or multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 groups as multiplets around 1.7 ppm.

- The terminal CH3 as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

That seems to fit the NMR data. So the substituent would be -CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But wait, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a iso-propyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, which is a two-carbon branch. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 groups at 1.7 ppm.

- The methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d), which would be split because it's attached to a CH.

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

That seems to fit. So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a iso-butyl group. Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, but that has a different branching.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Which would be a pentyl group attached to the benzene. But that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. The substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-, making it a iso-propyl group. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 (Ph-CH2-) at 1.7 ppm.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Another angle: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a benzyl ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Among the options, option C is a benzoic acid derivative. So perhaps X is the ester, and the product is the acid.

But in the given NMR of X, I don't see the ester oxygen's protons. So maybe X is not an ester but something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone. Then, the IR would have a C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a cleavage reaction. For example, benzaldehyde reacting to form benzoic acid. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but that's unlikely with HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to summarize what I know.

The NMR shows:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

- A peak at 10.5 ppm, likely an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.

- A substituent with a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), two CH2 groups (1.7 ppm, m), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t).

The IR shows a C=O at 1720, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid.

X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. This likely indicates a cleavage or hydrolysis reaction, probably of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X were the ester, then the reaction would produce this acid.

But does the given NMR fit the ester structure? Let me imagine X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-

Wait, no, the substituent would be at the para position. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, making it para to the ester group.

So the structure would be:

Ph-(sec-butyl)COOCH3

Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene. The substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to the benzene, and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

The NMR of X (the ester) would have:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

- The ester OCH3 would be a triplet around 3.8 ppm, but in the given NMR, there's no such peak. So this doesn't fit.

So perhaps X isn't an ester. Then, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a benzaldehyde with HI and red phosphorus might not proceed. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction is substitution to form a benzyl iodide, but that doesn't align with the product options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but I don't see the peak in the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitro compounds to amines, but that's another possibility. Alternatively, they're used in the conversion of alcohols to chlorides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another reaction: when a benzyl ester is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes elimination to form an acyl iodide and then possibly further reactions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a benzyl group. For example, if X is a benzyl halide, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid if there's a carbonyl group adjacent.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ketone, like Ph-CO-R. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could cleave the ketone to form an acid.

But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester of a carboxylic acid, and the reaction cleaves it to the acid.

But without seeing the OCH3 group in the NMR, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But I don't see the peaks for that.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

Given that the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, and if X is the ester, then the product would be option C. But without the OCH3 group in the NMR, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction is something else. But I can't think of a reaction that would convert a benzoic acid into another structure under these conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is a substitution to form benzyl iodide. But none of the options are benzyl iodides.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction converts it into benzyl iodide. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. But that would form an alkyne, which isn't among the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

The NMR of X has a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which could be a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each 2H, doublets), which suggests a para-disubstituted benzene.

If X is a carboxylic acid, then the substituent would be a side chain. Looking at option C, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a sec-butyl group and a COOH group in the para positions.

The NMR of such a structure would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (correct).

- The COOH proton at around 10.5 ppm (correct).

- The substituent's protons: the sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent's NMR would show:

   - The CH group (CH(CH3)) at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

   - The adjacent CH2 groups (from CH2-CH(CH3)-) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

   - The CH3 groups attached to the CH would show up as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) due to coupling with the adjacent CH.

   - The terminal CH3 at the end of the chain would appear as a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

This matches the NMR data given for X. So X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, benzoic acid wouldn't react with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps X is an ester of benzoic acid, and the reaction converts it into the acid.

But then, in that case, the NMR of X would have the ester's OCH3 group, which isn't present here. So perhaps X is the acid, and the reaction does something else. But I'm not sure what reaction would convert a benzoic acid into another compound with these reagents.

Wait, another possibility: X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid (option C). But the NMR of X (the ester) would have the OCH3 group, which isn't present. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction cleaves it to the acid.

But without the OCH3 peak, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the reaction is converting a benzyl ester into the acid, but X is the ester. Then, the NMR of X would need to account for the OCH3 group, which isn't present here. So that can't be right.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

Option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction converts it into the acid. But I don't see the connection.

Wait, maybe X is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction is a hydrolysis. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus forms a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: X is a benzyl ester of an acid chloride. But that's not fitting the data.

I think I'm not making progress. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The IR shows a carbonyl, which could be an ester, acid, or aldehyde. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene.

If X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is typically used in ester hydrolysis, doesn't make sense because X is already an acid. So this must not be the case.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction produces the acid. But without the OCH3 in the NMR, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another thought: The reaction might be a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg) and HCl, but the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which isn't the Clemmensen conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but again, not matching the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile, but I don't see a nitrile peak in the IR.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with option C as the product. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the IR and NMR data, X likely has a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group. So when X reacts, perhaps the substituent is altered.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis but something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. The reaction could be a Cannizzaro reaction, where an aldehyde without alpha hydrogens is converted into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But that requires a strong base, and red phosphorus and HI are present. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, but I don't know the conditions.

In any case, given the options and the data, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which could belong to an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid.
- The broad absorption in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** range suggests an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or branching.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H, likely CH₂ groups in a substituent.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group.

### Reaction Conditions:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for ester hydrolysis or cleavage of benzylic halides. This suggests that if X is an ester, the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure implies a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. However, the NMR data does not support the presence of an ethyl group, as there is no quartet for CH₂ or a triplet for CH₃ at ~4 ppm.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a disubstituted benzene with an isobutyl and methyl group in para positions. However, the IR data does not support the absence of a carbonyl group, and the NMR data does not match the expected signals for this structure.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. The NMR data aligns well:
   - The aromatic protons match the para-substitution pattern.
   - The sec-butyl group explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH₃), and 0.9 ppm (CH₃).
   - The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a disubstituted benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl group in para positions. The IR data does not support the absence of a carbonyl group, and the NMR data does not match this structure.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data strongly support that X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter the structure, as X is already a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
