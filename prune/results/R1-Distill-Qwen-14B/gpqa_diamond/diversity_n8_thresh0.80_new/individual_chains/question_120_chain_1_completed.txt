Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (plx in arcseconds). So, higher parallax means closer stars.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed—so that means the same number density throughout space, right? So if you look at a certain volume, you'll find the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere. But how does that translate when we talk about parallax?

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars at a certain distance depends on how much volume is available at that distance.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell with radius r and thickness dr is approximately 4πr² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r would give the volume per unit r, which is 4πr² dr. 

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density (n) of stars. So number of stars N = n * 4πr² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Oh right, plx (parallax) is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx. So substituting r as 1/plx, dr would be the change in distance. Let's see, dr is the derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. Wait, that's a small change, so maybe I should express dr in terms of d(plx). Let me think: r = 1/plx → dr = -1/(plx²) d(plx). Hmm, so the thickness of the shell dr can be written in terms of d plx. But wait, when parallax increases, distance decreases. So maybe I can relate the number of stars per unit parallax interval.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, perhaps I should find how many stars are there in a range of parallax d plx. Let me think about that.

If I have a range d plx, that corresponds to a range of distances. Let's say plx ranges from plx to plx + d plx. The corresponding distances would be r = 1/plx and r = 1/(plx + d plx). So the change in distance dr is approximately the derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So dr = d (1/plx) = -1/(plx²) d plx. Wait, but if plx increases, r decreases. So the distance interval is from 1/plx to 1/(plx + d plx), which is a small interval. So the distance interval is approximately 1/(plx²) d plx, but with a negative sign because as plx increases, the distance decreases. However, since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can take the absolute value, but let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit plx interval is the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr, but expressed as a function of plx.

Wait, earlier I had that N = n * 4π r² dr. But I want to express N as a function of plx. So substituting dr in terms of d plx.

From plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

But wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, so the number of stars in a positive d plx (increasing plx) would have a negative contribution. But since we're considering the number of stars per unit plx, maybe we can take the absolute value.

So, ignoring the negative sign for now, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx? Wait, that would make 1/plx^4. Because (1/plx^2) from r squared, and another (1/plx^2) from dr.

Wait, that would give N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx → 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Consider that the number of stars in a certain volume is n per unit volume. The volume element in terms of parallax.

Wait, if I think of the volume in terms of parallax, how does that work? Let's see, for a given parallax plx, the distance is r = 1/plx. The volume of a shell at r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

But dr can be expressed in terms of d plx, since r = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. So substituting, number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² d plx) ).

Which simplifies to N = n *4 π (1/plx^4) (-d plx). Since d plx is positive when plx increases, but dr is negative (since r decreases as plx increases), the negative sign here indicates the direction of change, but for the magnitude, it would be 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (like per parsec of plx or whatever unit) is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to reach this conclusion? Maybe considering the differential number of stars as a function of parallax.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a given volume is n, so the number per unit volume is n. The differential volume in terms of parallax is a thin shell. So dV = 4π r² dr. As before, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Substituting:

dV = 4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 d plx )

So dV = -4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

The number of stars in that volume element is n * dV = n * (-4 π 1/plx^4 d plx ). So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars (\( n \)). The volume of the shell is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \), so the number of stars in the shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \). Substituting this into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx})
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d(\text{plx}) \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).
