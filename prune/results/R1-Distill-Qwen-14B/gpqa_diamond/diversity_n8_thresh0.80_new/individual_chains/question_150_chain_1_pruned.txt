Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. That's five degrees, which could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and an additional double bond or ring or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests maybe coupling with two adjacent protons, but wait, aldehyde is usually a singlet. Wait, maybe it's an acidic proton like an aldehyde, but I'm a bit confused about the coupling. Or perhaps it's a phenolic OH? No, phenols usually are broad singlets around 5 ppm, or maybe if it's exchange broadened. Wait, but 9.72 is really high, so more likely an aldehyde.

Next, 6.98 ppm, doublet with 2H. That could be aromatic protons, perhaps ortho to a substituent. Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet with 2H. Maybe para-substituted aromatic groups? So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring, or maybe two substituents on a benzene ring.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an OH proton. But wait, it's a singlet but it's 2H, not 1H. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in an enol form or something. Or perhaps two protons in a conjugated system where they're not split much.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group next to an oxygen, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. Like OCH₂ or something similar.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring (since we have aromatic protons) and an aldehyde group. Also, perhaps some substituents on the benzene rings.

Wait, let's think about the aldehyde. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet. Aldehydes are usually at around 9-10 ppm, and as a singlet. But a triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is coupling with two neighboring protons. How can that happen? Maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system where the adjacent carbon has two protons. Like in a compound where the aldehyde is at the end of a conjugated double bond.

Wait, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. If the structure is something like R-CH₂-CHO, but wait, that wouldn't give a triplet. Or perhaps the aldehyde is adjacent to a double bond, like CH₂=CH-CHO, but that would have the aldehyde as a triplet if the adjacent CH₂ is split. No, wait, in that case, maybe the aldehyde would be a triplet if it's next to a CH₂ group. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is attached to a carbon that's connected to another group with two protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of doublets in aromatic region. Maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a central chain. Let's imagine a central chain with an aldehyde group and some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Benzene rings take up 6 carbons if it's a single ring, but two rings would take 12 carbons. Hmm, but the formula is C8, so perhaps it's one benzene ring and some substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's think about the NMR:

- The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably the aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? If the aldehyde is attached to a CH₂ group adjacent to a double bond, like in a structure like CH₂=CH-CHO. Then the aldehyde proton would be next to a CH₂ (which would have two protons), giving a triplet. Oh wait, but in that case, the aldehyde would be part of a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system with another group. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR again:

- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
These are likely to be two sets of para-substituted
