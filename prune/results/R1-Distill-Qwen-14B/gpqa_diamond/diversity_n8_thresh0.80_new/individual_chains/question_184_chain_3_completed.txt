Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break down the target molecule. 

The compound has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering seems to be such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in position 1, and nitro in position 3. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so maybe the positions are numbered based on their order of substitution?

I remember that when synthesizing benzene derivatives, the order in which substituents are introduced matters because of directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, while ether groups (like ethoxy) are ortho/para, and alkyl groups like tert-butyl are also ortho/para directors. Wait, but wait—actually, the substituents' directing effects influence where the next substituent will attach.

Let me list the substituents again: tert-butyl (a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group), ethoxy (activating, o/p), and nitro (deactivating, m-directing). Wait, no, nitro is deactivating and meta directing because it's an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3. So if I consider the substituents, the nitro is meta to the ethoxy and maybe the tert-butyl is in another position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that each new group is added considering the directing effects of the existing groups.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So numbering: let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, but how does that arrangement come about?

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. Benzene is the starting material. So first, I add one substituent, then another, then another. Each step depends on the directing effect of the existing groups.

Let me plan the synthesis steps.

Optionally, I can choose the order of substituents. Which substituent would be best to add first?

Nitro groups are usually introduced via nitration, which is a meta-directing reaction. But if I add nitro first, then the next substituent would go meta to it, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, adding the tert-butyl first. Let's see: tert-butyl is a strong activating group, so any subsequent substitution would be directed by it.

Wait, but if I add tert-butyl first, then the next substituent would go ortho or para to it. So for example, nitration would add nitro group meta to the tert-butyl? Wait, no. The tert-butyl is a strong activating, ortho/para director. Nitration is a nitration (meta), but wait, in a ring with an activating group, where does the nitro go?

Wait, when you have an activating group (like tert-butyl) on the ring, the next nitration would occur in the ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl. Because the activating group directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution. So if I have a benzene ring with a tert-butyl group, nitration would add the nitro group at the ortho and para positions relative to the tert-butyl. So nitro would be either ortho or para to tert-butyl. But in the target, the nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy in position 1 and the tert-butyl in position 2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the order of substituents. Let me think: adding the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro? Or another order.

Alternatively, maybe add the ethoxy group first. Since ethoxy is a strong activating group, it directs incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2 (so adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro in 3. Hmm. So in that case, if ethoxy is in position 1, and tert-butyl in 2 (ortho), then nitro is in position 3 (meta to ethoxy perhaps?).

Wait, maybe adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro? Or maybe ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Wait, but let me think about the directing effects. 

If I add ethoxy first, the next substituent (like tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to the ethoxy. So if I add tert-butyl as the second substituent, it could go ortho to ethoxy, which would be position 2. Then, the third substituent, nitro, would be added in a position directed by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but how would the directing work when there are multiple substituents? The positions are determined by the strongest activating groups. Also, meta directors can influence the position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should plan the steps in reverse. Let me look at the target: the substituents are at 1,2,3 positions. So perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, because nitration is a strong deactivating group and it's in the meta position relative to the ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced first, but that seems unlikely because it's a deactivating group, making further substitution harder. But since nitro groups are meta directors, adding a substituent next to nitro would be meta to it.

Wait, perhaps I should outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then add ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, adding tert-butyl first:

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride (using AlCl3 as catalyst). So benzene + tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

Next step: adding ethoxy. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the ethoxy would add ortho or para to it. So possible positions are ortho and para to the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2. So that's adjacent (ortho). So if I add ethoxy next, it could go ortho to tert-butyl, which would be position 2 relative to the ethoxy? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps adding ethoxy after tert-butyl leads to ethoxy being ortho to tert-butyl. Then, when adding nitro, it would be para to the ethoxy or ortho to the tert-butyl. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Nitration first? But that would make the ring deactivating. Next substituents would be harder to add.

But let's think: 

Benzen → nitration → nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps add tert-butyl. But nitro is a meta director, so the tert-butyl would add meta to nitro. Then, add ethoxy in the para position to tert-butyl or something.

Wait, but that might not lead to the desired arrangement.

Alternatively, another approach: the target has three substituents. Let's plan their order of addition.

Optionally, perhaps we should add the nitro group last because it is a meta director, which may help in positioning. Alternatively, adding it first could complicate things.

Wait, an alternative approach: use the Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl first, then introduce the ethoxy group in the ortho position, then nitrate in a position that would end up as meta to the ethoxy.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituents in the target:

The ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl? Not sure).

Wait, perhaps the synthesis should involve the following steps:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

2. Then, introduce the ethoxy group, which would be ortho to tert-butyl.

3. Then, nitrate in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be adjacent (ortho) to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw this.

Imagine benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3.

Suppose after adding tert-butyl, it's in position 2.

Then, adding ethoxy in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl, which is in 2). Then, nitro would go into position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) or ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy in position 1, the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the ethoxy (as it's a stronger activating group than the tert-butyl?) or perhaps the tert-butyl is a stronger director.

Hmm, perhaps the order of steps matters. Let's consider each step:

1. Add tert-butyl → substituent in position 2.

2. Add ethoxy → in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl).

But wait, why would ethoxy go into position 1 when it's ortho to the tert-butyl. Because after adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated, and the ethoxy would add in ortho or para to the tert-butyl. So let's say it's in position 3, which is para to tert-butyl (position 2). Wait, positions are a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added next, and it goes into ortho position relative to the tert-butyl. So if tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy would be in position 1 or 3. But in the target, ethoxy is in position 1, and nitro in 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Let's think about that.

So, first, add tert-butyl (position 2), then add ethoxy (position 1), and then nitro in position 3, which would be meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl. Wait, that's possible.

But how to add the nitro group in that position. Let me think about the order of reactions.

Wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring has two activating groups: tert-butyl (activating, o/p-directing) and ethoxy (activating, o/p-directing). So when adding a third substituent like nitro, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, where would it go?

Wait, but nitro is introduced via nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution. So when the ring has multiple substituents, the incoming group will go to the position that is activated the most.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would be directed by the existing substituents. Let's think: the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2. The possible positions for nitro would be meta to ethoxy, which would be position 4, or perhaps in the ortho position to the tert-butyl, which is position 1 or 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the nitro is adjacent to the ethoxy and the tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl (say, in position 2).

2. Then nitrate, adding nitro in position 3 (meta to tert-butyl? No, wait, tert-butyl is an activating group, o/p director. So nitration would add nitro in ortho or para to tert-butyl. Suppose it's added in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl in 2).

3. Then add ethoxy. Since the ring now has tert-butyl in 2 and nitro in 3, where would ethoxy go? The nitro is a deactivating, meta director. The tert-butyl is activating, o/p. So during ethoxylation, the ethoxy would prefer to go where both groups direct, but perhaps the activating groups are more influential. So ethoxy could go para to nitro (position 6) or ortho/para to tert-butyl. But we need ethoxy in position 1, which is ortho to tert-butyl in 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the order of substitution.

Wait, another approach: The substituents in the target are at 1,2,3 positions. So perhaps the order of addition is tert-butyl (position 2), nitro (position 3), then ethoxy (position 1). Or another order.

Wait, but let's think about the directing. Let's say I add tert-butyl first. Then, nitrate. Since the ring is activated, nitration would add nitro in ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Let's say nitro is in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl in 2). Now the ring has substituents in 2 (tert-butyl) and 3 (nitro). 

Next, adding ethoxy. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl (activating, o/p) and nitro (deactivating, m) group. Where would the ethoxy group go? The ethoxy is an activating group, so it would prefer positions activated by the existing groups. The tert-butyl is activating, so ortho or para to it (positions 1, 4, or 6). The nitro is deactivating, so it doesn't help in activating the ring. So the ethoxy would likely go ortho to the tert-butyl, which is position 1 or 3. But position 3 is already occupied by nitro. So it would go to position 1. 

So the substituents would be tert-butyl (2), nitro (3), ethoxy (1). That's the target structure. So the order would be: first tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy as the last step? Because ethoxylation is typically through a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps via a tosylate or using a Friedel-Crafts type reaction? Wait, no, ethoxy is usually introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I think Friedel-Crafts acylation isn't suitable for ethers. Alternatively, maybe using a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's more for forming ethers from alcohols.

Wait, no, typically, for introducing an ethoxy group on benzene, you can use ethyl nitrite and H2SO4 (like the Gattermann–Koch reaction?), but more commonly, maybe using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with an ethyl halide. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses alkyl halides, but for ethers, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps using a two-step process where a benzyl halide is formed and then substituted. Alternatively, maybe using an ethoxy group through an electrophilic substitution using ethyl sulfate or similar.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via nitration, then reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires the ring to be activated. But nitro groups are deactivating, so the ring would be deactivated, making nucleophilic substitution difficult. Hmm, but in our case, after adding nitro and tert-butyl, the ring might not be very reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation as the last step, but I think that's not possible because Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activating. But in this case, one substituent is nitro (deactivating), so the ring might not be reactive enough for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, maybe I should consider the order differently. Let me think: perhaps adding the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, then nitration.

If I add ethoxy first, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to it. Let's say it goes ortho, to position 2. Now, the ring has ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Next, nitration. Nitro would be added in a position directed by ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Since both ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating groups, ortho/para directors. So the nitro would go into a position that is activated by both. Let's see: possible positions for nitro would be meta to ethoxy (position 4) or ortho to tert-butyl (position 3). Hmm, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1). So perhaps adding nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but how would that happen? Because after adding ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2), the ring has activating groups in 1 and 2. Where would nitration occur? The most activated positions would be ortho or para to each of the activating groups.

But given the proximity, perhaps nitro would add in position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy. That could be the case.

So the order would be: ethoxy (position 1), then tert-butyl (position 2), then nitro (position 3). 

But how to add the nitro group there. Let's think about the steps.

1. Add ethoxy to benzene via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, because ethoxy is an ether. Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't typically used for adding ethers; you need a different approach. Alternatively, can I introduce an ethoxy group via a different method, like using an ethyl halide in a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and an activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps use a directing group approach. For example, introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, then use that to direct the incoming groups. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added via nitration as the last step. But let me think about each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the tert-butyl group, then nitro, and then ethoxy. But as I thought earlier, adding ethoxy last might be challenging because the ring could be deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to nitrate first, then add the tert-butyl, then add the ethoxy. But that might be tricky because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult.

Wait, let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options A, B, C, D, each option lists a series of reactions. I need to find the sequence that leads to the target molecule.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. ii) HNO3/H2SO4. iii) SO3/H2SO4. iv) NaNO2/HCl. v) dilute H2SO4. vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat. vii) NaOH/EtBr. viii) Fe/HCl. ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me try to parse this.

Option A: The steps are:

i. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii. Nitration (HNO3, H2SO4). So adds nitro group. Where? Since tert-butyl is activating, o/p director, so nitro would go ortho or para to it.

Then iii. SO3/H2SO4. That's sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, m-directing group. So adding a sulfonic acid group.

iv. NaNO2/HCl. That's diazotization. Typically done on aromatic amines, but wait, in which step? Wait, after sulfonation, when would you have an amine to diazotize? Maybe I'm getting confused. Or perhaps this step is for something else.

v. Dilute H2SO4. Maybe steam distillation or acid workup.

vi. H3O+, H2O, heat. That could be a hydrolysis step, like the hydrolysis of a nitro group to amine, but nitro doesn't hydrolyze that way. Alternatively, maybe hydrolysis of a sulfonic acid ester? Not sure.

vii. NaOH, EtBr. That's a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps for introducing an ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction. But how would that apply?

viii. Fe/HCl. That's a typical setup for a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but not sure where that would come from.

ix. HNO3/H2SO4 again. Another nitration. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: i. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. ii. HNO3. iii. Fe/HCl. iv. HNO3 again. v. NaNO2. vi. H3O+/H2O. vii. NaOH/EtBr. viii. SO3. ix. dilute H2SO4.

Option C: i. tert-butyl chloride. ii. SO3. iii. HNO3. iv. Fe/HCl. v. NaNO2. vi. HNO3 again. vii. H3O+/H2O. viii. dilute H2SO4. ix. NaOH/EtBr.

Option D: i. HNO3. ii. Fe/HCl. iii. tert-butyl chloride. iv. HNO3. v. NaNO2. vi. SO3. vii. dilute H2SO4. viii. H3O+/H2O. ix. NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, trying to figure out what each option does.

Looking for the correct sequence, perhaps we can reason which steps make sense.

Let me think about the possible reactions:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation (add tert-butyl)
- Nitration (add nitro)
- Sulfonation (add sulfonic acid)
- Diazotization (convert amine to diazonium salt)
- Hydrolysis (maybe of a nitro group to amine or something else)
- NaOH and EtBr: perhaps a Williamson ether synthesis, where a good leaving group is replaced by OEt. For example, if there's a tosylate group, you could substitute it with OEt using NaOH and EtBr.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a leaving group, then substituting it with an ethoxy group.

Let me consider the target molecule: it has an ethoxy group. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via substitution at some point.

Now, perhaps the steps go something like:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Nitrate (add nitro)
3. Sulfonate (add SO3 group)
4. Reduce the sulfonic acid to something else? Or perhaps use the sulfonic acid as a leaving group.
Wait, sulfonic acid groups are strong leaving groups under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is used as a directing group for further substitution.

Wait, another approach: introducing substituents in a way that the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution.

But in any case, perhaps I should try to work through the options.

Option D:

i. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene

ii. Fe/HCl → this is a reducing agent. Fe in HCl is usually for reducing nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, after Fe/HCl, we have aniline. Aniline is a strong activating group (NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director). So adding tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amine.

iv. HNO3 again → nitration. Now the ring has aniline (NH2) and tert-butyl. The NH2 is a stronger activating group than alkyl groups, so the nitration would be directed by NH2. So nitro would go ortho or para to NH2.

v. NaNO2/HCl → this is diazotization of the amine (from step ii: aniline → amine → diazonium chloride).

vi. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. But after diazonium, perhaps the ring is being modified. For example, diazonium salt can undergo various reactions, like Sandmeyer reaction, but I'm not sure how sulfonation fits in.

vii. dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

viii. H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis conditions. Maybe hydrolysis of a nitro group or another functional group.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → substitution reaction, maybe introducing ethoxy.

Hmm, not sure if this leads to the target.

Alternatively, let's think about option C:

i. tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii. SO3 → sulfonation → add sulfonic acid group.

iii. HNO3 → nitration. Now, sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta director. So nitrating would go meta to it.

iv. Fe/HCl → reduce something. Maybe the sulfonic acid group is reduced? Unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps reducing a nitro group to amine. But in step iii, we added nitro, then in step iv, reduce it.

v. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine formed from step iv.

vi. HNO3 again → possibly another nitration.

vii. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii. dilute H2SO4 → acid conditions.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Not sure.

Option B:

i. tert-butyl → add.

ii. HNO3 → nitrate, adding nitro in ortho or para.

iii. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv. HNO3 → nitrate again.

v. NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii. NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii. SO3 → sulfonate.

ix. dilute H2SO4.

Hmm.

Option A:

i. tert-butyl.

ii. nitrate.

iii. SO3 → sulfonate.

iv. NaNO2 → diazotize.

v. dilute H2SO4.

vi. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii. NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii. Fe/HCl → reduce.

ix. HNO3.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps involve adding the tert-butyl first, then the nitro, then the sulfonic acid, then some reductions, and finally substituting with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a sulfonic acid group acting as a leaving group.

Wait, after adding the tert-butyl and nitro groups, perhaps introducing a sulfonic acid group in a position that can be replaced by ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Nitrate → add nitro
3. Sulfonate → add sulfonic acid (SO3 group) in a position that can later be substituted.
4. Reduce the sulfonic acid group to a good leaving group (like a tosylate)
5. Substitute the leaving group with ethoxy using NaOH and EtBr.

Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are already good leaving groups under certain conditions. So maybe after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the sulfonic acid is added in a position, and then replaced with ethoxy.

But how does that lead to the target structure?

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

i. Add tert-butyl.

ii. Nitrate → nitro in ortho to tert-butyl.

iii. Sulfonate → add SO3 in a position that will later be replaced by ethoxy.

iv. Then, remove the sulfonic acid group and substitute with ethoxy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option's steps do.

Option D:

i. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2. So now, aniline.

iii. Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl → add tert-butyl in ortho or para to NH2.

iv. Nitrate → another nitro group, which would be directed by NH2 (stronger than the alkyl group). So new nitro in ortho or para to NH2.

v. NaNO2 → diazotize the NH2 group.

vi. SO3 → sulfonate? Not sure.

vii. dilute H2SO4 → acid.

viii. H3O+/H2O → heat, perhaps hydrolysis.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Not sure if this leads to the desired structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C: 

i. Add tert-butyl.

ii. Sulfonate.

iii. Nitrate.

iv. Reduce.

v. Diazotize.

vi. Nitrate again.

vii. Hydrolyze.

viii. Acid.

ix. Substitute with ethoxy.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

Add tert-butyl, then nitrate, then sulfonate, then substitute the sulfonic acid with ethoxy.

Looking at the options, which option has that sequence?

Looking at option A: after adding tert-butyl and nitro, it sulfonates, then does NaNO2, then H3O+, then NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid, the sulfonic acid can be replaced by ethoxy. For example, if the sulfonic acid is in a position that, upon substitution, becomes the ethoxy group.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro in ortho or para.

3. Sulfonate → add SO3 in another position.

4. Diazotize (using NaNO2/HCl on an amine group, but where would that amine come from? Unless we have a nitro group that's reduced.

Wait, perhaps in option A, after nitration and sulfonation, the next step is NaNO2, which requires an amine. So perhaps the nitro group was reduced to an amine.

So:

i. Add tert-butyl.

ii. Nitrate → nitro group.

iii. Sulfonate → add SO3.

iv. NaNO2/HCl → but for this, we need an amine. So perhaps one of the nitro groups is reduced to amine. So step iv would be reducing a nitro group to amine.

Wait, but in step ii, after nitration, we have a nitro group. Then in step iii, we sulfonate, adding another group. Then, step iv is NaNO2, which requires an amine. So perhaps we reduce the nitro group in step iv.

Wait, but step iv in option A is NaNO2, which doesn't involve a reducing agent. So that doesn't make sense because to form a diazonium salt, you need an amine, which comes from a nitro group being reduced. So perhaps step iv in option A is following a reduction step.

Wait, option A steps:

i. Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl.

ii. Nitrate → add nitro.

iii. Sulfonate → add SO3.

iv. NaNO2 → diazotization. So we must have an amine somewhere. So maybe one of the nitro groups is reduced to amine before this step. But in option A, the steps don't include a reduction step before NaNO2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me think about option D's steps again.

Option D:

i. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

iii. Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl (ortho or para to NH2).

iv. Nitrate → add nitro (directed by NH2).

v. NaNO2/HCl → diazotize the NH2 group (from step ii).

vi. SO3 → sulfonate? Or perhaps another reaction, like introducing a sulfonic acid group.

vii. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

viii. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis. Maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → substitution to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, let me outline this scenario:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl. Since NH2 is a strong o/p director, tert-butyl would add ortho or para to NH2.

Assuming it adds ortho, so benzene has NH2 in position 1 and tert-butyl in position 2.

4. Nitrate → add nitro. NH2 directs to o/p, so nitro would go in position 3 or 4. Let's say position 3.

Now the substituents are NH2 (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3).

5. Diazotize the NH2 group → form diazonium chloride.

6. Treat with SO3/H2SO4 → perhaps sulfonate? Or another reaction. Wait, after diazonium salt formation, common reactions include coupling or replacing with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps step vi is introducing a sulfonic acid group. But I'm not certain.

7. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

8. H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis. Maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group. So position 1 would become -OH.

9. NaOH/EtBr → this is a nucleophilic substitution. In presence of NaOH and EtBr, an ethoxy group could be substituted into a good leaving group. So if position 1 now has an -OH, perhaps it's converted to a tosylate or similar in a previous step, then substituted with OEt.

Wait, but step vi was SO3, which is sulfonation. So perhaps the OH group is sulfonated to become a good leaving group.

Wait, step vi is SO3/H2SO4. So if after step viii, we have an -OH group in position 1, treating it with SO3 would sulfonate it, making it a better leaving group. Then, in step ix, treatment with NaOH and EtBr would substitute the sulfonate group with OEt.

So putting it all together:

1. Nitro group added.

2. Reduced to NH2.

3. Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl ortho to NH2.

4. Nitration adds nitro in position 3.

5. Diazotization → NH2 → diazonium.

6. Sulfonate the hydroxyl group (if any), but wait, after step viii, we have an -OH group, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps after step viii, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to an -OH group in position 1.

Then in step vi, perhaps sulfonate that -OH group, making it a good leaving group.

Then, step ix: NaOH and EtBr would substitute the sulfonate group with OEt.

So the final structure would have:

- Position 1: OEt.

- Position 2: tert-butyl.

- Position 3: nitro.

Which matches the target: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitrobenzene.

So the steps in option D are:

i. Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii. Reduce → NH2 (aniline).

iii. Alkylation → tert-butyl (ortho to NH2).

iv. Nitrate → nitro (ortho to NH2, position 3).

v. Diazotize → NH2 → diazonium.

vi. Hydrolysis → convert to OH (position 1).

vii. Acid → perhaps sulfonate.

Wait, no, step vi in option D is SO3. So after hydrolysis, we have OH in position 1.

Then step vi is SO3, which sulfonates the OH to OSO3H, making a good leaving group.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

Step viii: H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is treated with SO3 to introduce a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but if option D leads to the correct substituents in the correct positions, it might be the right answer.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has three substituents. The way the options are structured, each option adds multiple substituents in a certain order. The correct option must end up with the substituents positioned correctly.

The correct option would have to add the nitro groups and tert-butyl in a way that allows the ethoxy to be added in the right position, perhaps via substitution.

Looking back, if option D is correct, the steps would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to NH2 → aniline.

3. Alkylation → add tert-butyl ortho to NH2.

4. Nitrate → add nitro ortho to NH2 (position 3).

5. Diazotize NH2 → diazonium.

6. Introduce sulfonic acid (SO3) → perhaps on the NH2 site, but after diazotization, maybe that's not where it goes.

Alternatively, after diazotization and hydrolysis, position 1 becomes OH. Then sulfonate that to make it a good leaving group. Then substitute with OEt.

So the final structure would have OEt in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

Yes, that matches the target.

So option D's steps would lead to that.

Wait, let me check option D's steps again:

i. HNO3 → nitro.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii. AlCl3/tert-butyl → add tert-butyl ortho to NH2.

iv. HNO3 → nitro added ortho to NH2 (position 3).

v. NaNO2 → diazotize NH2 (position 1).

vi. SO3 → sulfonate the hydroxyl group formed after hydrolysis.

vii. dilute H2SO4 → acid.

viii. H3O+/H2O → hydrolyze the diazonium salt to OH.

Wait, no, step viii is after step vii. Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

After step v (diazonium), step vi is sulfonation. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step vi is sulfonating another position.

Wait, maybe after steps i to iv, we have:

- Nitro in position 1 (from step i).

Wait, no, step i is nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene. Then step ii reduces to NH2 in position 1. Step iii adds tert-butyl in position 2. Step iv nitrates, adding nitro in position 3 (ortho to NH2 in 1). So now substituents are NH2 (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3).

Step v: diazotize NH2 → NH2 (1) becomes diazonium.

Step vi: SO3 → sulfonate. Where? Maybe the NH2 is replaced with a sulfonic acid group? No, because after diazotization, it's a diazonium salt. Treating with SO3 might replace the diazonium group with sulfonic acid. So position 1 becomes SO3H.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → acid. Maybe to protonate something.

Step viii: H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of the sulfonic acid group? Unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps step viii is hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So position 1 becomes -OH.

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → substitute the -OH with OEt.

So the substituents become:

- OEt (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3).

Which matches the target.

So the correct sequence is option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) are introduced in the correct positions (2, 1, and 3, respectively). The order of substitution is critical due to the directing effects of the functional groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group.
   - Follows with nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, and other steps.
   - The sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions of the substituents, as the ethoxy group introduction is unclear.

2. **Option B**:
   - Adds the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, reduction, and other steps.
   - The sequence does not clearly establish the correct positions of the substituents, particularly the ethoxy group.

3. **Option C**:
   - Adds the tert-butyl group first, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, and other steps.
   - Similar to the other options, the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions of the substituents.

4. **Option D**:
   - Begins with nitration to introduce the nitro group.
   - Reduces the nitro group to an amine (-NH₂).
   - Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which is directed by the amine group.
   - Nitrates again to introduce another nitro group, directed by the amine group.
   - Diazotizes the amine group and introduces a sulfonic acid group.
   - Hydrolyzes the sulfonic acid group to a hydroxyl group (-OH).
   - Substitutes the hydroxyl group with an ethoxy group (-OEt) using NaOH and EtBr.

This sequence ensures that the substituents are introduced in the correct positions:
- The nitro group is introduced first.
- The tert-butyl group is added ortho to the amine group (-NH₂).
- The second nitro group is introduced ortho to the amine group.
- The amine group is replaced with a hydroxyl group, which is then substituted with an ethoxy group.

Thus, the final structure has the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3, matching the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.
