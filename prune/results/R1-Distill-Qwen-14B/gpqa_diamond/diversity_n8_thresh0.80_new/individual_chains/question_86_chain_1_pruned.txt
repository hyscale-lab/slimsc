Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The options give possible starting materials A and B for each reaction.

Hmm, I need to determine what starting materials A and B are based on the reactions. The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one, but wait, aren't both of them borohydride-based? Oh wait, no, LiBH4 is typically used in more polar aprotic solvents and is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, which is usually used in less polar solvents. Or wait, I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3Â·THF (which is a common form of BH3). So, LiBH4 would reduce more stubborn functional groups, maybe ketones, while BH3 might be used for other reductions, like esters or amides? Or wait, no, LiBH4 usually reduces ketones and aldehydes, as does BH3, but BH3 is more selective sometimes. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other is S. So, the product is a cyclic ket
