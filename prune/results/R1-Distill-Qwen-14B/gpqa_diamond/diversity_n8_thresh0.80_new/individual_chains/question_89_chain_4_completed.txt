Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what each part is doing.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. Heating this with excess KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction, since KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, losing HBr and forming a double bond. 

Wait, the product after heating with KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region usually corresponds to something like an ether or an alcohol, maybe an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides have peaks around 3.5-4.5, but maybe it's an ether. Alternatively, it could be a diol, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl. So, like an ester or a ketone. Wait, wait, when dibromide reacts with KOH, it might form an epoxide if it's a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal; it's 1 and 3, so they're not adjacent. So elimination to form a double bond might not be possible because the positions are too far apart. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is more for elimination, especially with vicinal dihalides, but here, maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide reacts with KOH, it can form a carbonyl if the two Xs are on adjacent carbons, but if not adjacent, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed elimination, but the base might not allow that. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the IR data: the strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh wait, maybe it's a formation of a ketone via a double elimination. So each Br is replaced by an O- which then gets protonated. Wait, but that would require two equivalents of KOH? Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, could undergo two dehydrohalogenations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution, but that's less likely because KOH is a strong base, favoring elimination.

Wait, perhaps the structure forms an epoxide. No, because the dihalide is not vicinal. So that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, product 1's 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be an epoxide, but if the two Brs are on the same face, when KOH is added, it could form an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure with the Brs on adjacent carbons in a way that's not possible for epoxide formation. Hmm, maybe it's a transannular epoxide? Or perhaps the reaction isn't forming an epoxide but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming two carbonyl groups. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but then where is the carbonyl coming from. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, but maybe there's a neighboring group that's getting deprotonated, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is adamantanone. Wait, adamantane has four rings, so if two Br atoms are removed and replaced by oxygen, maybe it's forming a ketone. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: if each Br is replaced by an O, would that make a diketone? But that would require two oxygens. But KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but since the Brs are on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent, it can't form a double bond. So maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution with KOH, but that would require a good leaving group and a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution, but KOH is a base, so more likely elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is for 2H, which is a singlet, since the integration is 2H. So maybe that's an OCH2 group, like in an ether. But then, why the IR peak at 1720? Because that's a carbonyl. So maybe that 2H is part of an epoxide. But wait, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a strained structure, it could be higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is a carbonyl compound. So perhaps it's a ketone. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, maybe forming a ketone. Let me think: if the structure is such that the two Brs are on carbons that become a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ring contraction. For example, if two adjacent carbons each lose Br and form a double bond, but how would that form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination. Maybe it's a substitution, but with two equivalents of KOH. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would substitute each Br with OH groups, forming 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps heating with KOH leads to a Rearrangement reaction, such as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via an elimination where two Br atoms are removed, and a carbonyl forms. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require more than KOH, perhaps some kind of oxidation. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the other steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But product 1 has a carbonyl group; perhaps it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, but product 1 has a 1H NMR with 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet), 1.94 (2H). The 10H multiplet in the 2.4-2.2 region suggests perhaps a cyclopropane ring or some sort of bridged structure. Alternatively, it's the adamantane part, as adamantane has a lot of CH2 groups.

Wait, product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet, so no splitting. The 10H in 2.4-2.23 suggests perhaps a ring structure, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

If product 1 is 1,3-diketone, then product 2 would be from Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which when treated with a Lewis acid would undergo some ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) and heated. So maybe product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acid anhydride, but not sure.

Wait, another angle. The product 1 is a light yellow solid, which after treatment with KOH, which suggests maybe an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, specifically adamantanone.

Wait, adamantane has four rings. If we remove the Br's from 1 and 3, perhaps it's forming a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would make a diol. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, not an alcohol.

Hmm. Wait, wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, where each Br leaves, and each adjacent C becomes a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when treated with KOH, each Br is removed with a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of two carbonyls. That would form a diketone, making 1,3-adamantanedione.

But wait, would that make sense structurally? Adamantane is a diamondoid, so the positions 1 and 3 might be in such a way that elimination would form two ketones. Let me think: if the structure is such that each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another CH2, then elimination would form a double bond, but since it's 1,3, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization or some other rearrangement. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should move forward and see if the other steps clarify things.

So product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts or as a catalyst for some acylation reactions. If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acylated product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 would need to have an alkylating group.

Wait, product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet). Maybe that's an OCH2 group, like in a methyl ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. If that were the case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that can't be right. So back to the drawing board.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution of both Br atoms by hydroxide, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't seem straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces the formation of a carbonyl via some elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let's say that 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form an epoxide. Then, the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C stretch, but that's around 1200 cm⁻¹, not 1720. So that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. So the initial step forms a ketone, which would explain the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR peak. Then, product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some rearrangement or addition.

Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Maybe product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acid. Or perhaps it's some kind of acylation. Hmm.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. But for that, product 2 needs to have a double bond. So if product 2 is a diene or a compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to piece this together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (carbonyl, IR at 1720). So product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound.

Step 2: product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2.

Step 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

Product 3's NMR: looking for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding exchangeables). The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

So perhaps product 3 is a result of ozonolysis on a diene, giving carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1. If it's a dehydrohalogenation, maybe forming a ketone. Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, and adjacent H are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantanedione. So product 1 is a diketone.

Then, step 2: product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a diketone, which is a strong electron-deficient molecule. So perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone undergoes a pinacol rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone; maybe it's used to acylate something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another possibility: the diketone could react with a Lewis acid to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of cyclization or dimerization. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier reasoning suggests that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or acylation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is a diene or an olefin.

Wait, so product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2, which has a double bond. How does that happen? Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But that doesn't fit with the IR data. So no, product 1 can't be a diol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH? Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Because enol ethers can form via acid-catalyzed dehydration of diols, but I'm not sure how that would happen here.

Wait, wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl. That doesn't fit. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, but that's conflicting with the IR. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a tertiary alcohol. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, it might undergo some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but let's think about product 1's NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet. That could be an -O-CH2-O- group, like in a cyclic ether, but that would require more protons. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, but in a singlet, so maybe it's an OCH2 group in an ester or ether.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on product 1, so maybe I should move forward.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis of an enol ether would cleave the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. But ozone usually reacts with alkenes, so product 2 must have a double bond.

If product 2 is an enol ether, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyls.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis. Let's imagine product 3 is a diketone or two carbonyl compounds.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Another approach: think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone or similar, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl. In a diketone, the α hydrogens (next to the carbonyl) are usually deshielded.

The coupling pattern depends on neighboring hydrogens. For example, if the α H is next to a CH2 group, it might couple with multiple protons.

Wait, in the starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the structure is such that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added, perhaps each bridgehead Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, forming a bicyclic diketone.

Then, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of rearrangement to form a diene. For example, maybe a pinacol-like rearrangement, but pinacol is more about vicinal diols. Alternatively, perhaps the diketone undergoes a Claisen-like condensation, forming a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-adamantanedione has two ketone groups on adjacent bridgeheads, which could lose two water molecules and form a conjugated diene via an elimination reaction, especially under acidic conditions provided by a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3.

So product 2 could be a bicyclic diene, perhaps something like 1,3-adamantadiene.

Then, ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would form two carbonyl groups. However, if the diene is part of a ring, the ozonolysis might break the ring.

Wait, but let's imagine product 2 is a diene. Upon ozonolysis, the diene (which could be a conjugated diene) would form two carbonyl groups. For example, if it's a four-membered ring with a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break the ring into two fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but in this case, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a ketone; the alpha hydrogens would be deshielded.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be next to a carbonyl. Let's think about the structure: if product 3 is a diketone, each of the carbonyls has adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but let's think about the coupling pattern. The alpha H (next to carbonyl) would couple with adjacent Hs. For example, if it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl, each H would couple with the other (geminal coupling isn't usually observed in 1H NMR) and with neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps the alpha H is part of a CH2 group. So each H in CH2 would couple with adjacent Hs. Let's imagine that the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2) and perhaps another coupling.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the product would be two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example, if the diene was in a ring, ozonolysis would break the ring into a dialdehyde or diketone. Let me think in terms of adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is two separate carbonyl compounds, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's try to imagine product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but if it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as a diketone or dialdehyde.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like 1,2-diketone. The alpha Hs would be on the CH2 groups next to each ketone.

Each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, for example, if each H on the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs from one side and two from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets or something similar.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. Let's say the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group. Each H in the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same carbon (geminal, which doesn't split the signal) and perhaps two Hs on the neighboring carbon.

Wait, but geminal coupling is usually J around 2 Hz and not observed under normal conditions. So, the coupling would come from vicinal Hs (on adjacent carbons).

So, if H is on a CH2 and adjacent to another CH2, each H would split into a triplet due to coupling with two Hs on the adjacent carbon. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, it might become more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on one side and possibly two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. Or maybe it's a pentet if it's coupling with two groups of two Hs each.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet because each H is coupling with two Hs from one adjacent group, but not from another.

Wait, another approach: when you ozonolyze a diene, you get carbonyl groups. Suppose the diene in product 2 is a 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, resulting in product 3 as a dialdehyde or a diketone.

But specifically, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds, leading to carbonyl groups.

But perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a structure where each ketone is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group. So, for example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O.

In such a structure, the middle CH2 groups would have Hs that are next to two CH2 groups. Each H on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side, so each H would couple with four Hs in total. That would lead to a quintet (five peaks), but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 between the carbonyls would have Hs that couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, each H would couple with two Hs, so each would be a triplet. But if each CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H on the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the central CH2 group's Hs would couple with the two Hs on each neighboring CH2 group. Each H on the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on one side (from the left CH2) and two on the other (from the right CH2). That would mean each H has four neighboring Hs in total, but since they're split into two groups of two, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between two different sets, leading to a doublet of doublets or something else.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded. So, for O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each end CH2 would have Hs that are adjacent to the carbonyl, so those would be the most deshielded.

The end CH2 Hs would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs). So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. But wait, the end CH2 is only adjacent to one CH2 group, so each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the options include triplet of triplets. How?

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to more complex coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. The middle CH2's Hs would be next to two CH2 groups (left and right). Each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right. So each H would split into a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in that case, the middle CH2's Hs would be the most deshielded? No, the end CH2 groups are next to the carbonyls, so their Hs are more deshielded.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on the end CH2 groups. Each of those Hs would be adjacent to the CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

So each H on the end CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, which would correspond to this.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is the focus. Let me think again. Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which came from product 1 treated with Al(i-Pr)3.

Another angle: product 1 is a ketone. Product 2, after treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps undergoes an elimination to form an alkene. So product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis of that would form carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, such as a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. Wait, but if product 2 is a cyclic alkene, ozonolysis would break the ring and form two carbonyls connected by a chain.

So, say product 2 is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with two carbonyls.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to retrace:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (carbonyl, IR 1720). Probably a diketone.
2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2. Possibly elimination to form a diene.
3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3. Cleavage of double bonds into carbonyls.

If product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group with another CH2 group in between, the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

If each of those Hs is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, then each would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But let me think about possible structures. Suppose product 3 is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to another CH2 group. The end CH2 groups (next to carbonyls) would each have two neighboring Hs (from the middle CH2). So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, the end CH2's Hs are only adjacent to one CH2 group (the middle one), so each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2's Hs would be next to two CH2 groups (left and right), so each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

In that case, the middle CH2's Hs would be more shielded than the end CH2's, which are next to the carbonyl. So the most deshielded Hs are on the end CH2 groups, which are triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Therefore, the answer would be option A.

But wait, the options also include 'triplet of triplets' as option B. So perhaps I'm missing something in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the product 3 is a more complex structure where each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs. For example, if the H is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H would couple with two Hs from one group and two from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups, like CH2-CH2-CH2, then each H would see two on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So in that case, the middle H would be a triplet of triplets, and the end Hs would be triplets.

But the question asks for the most deshielded H, which would be the end Hs, as they are next to the carbonyl. So their coupling would be a triplet.

Therefore, the correct answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination, forming a diketone, specifically 1,3-adamantanedione. The IR spectrum supports this, as the strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of carbonyl groups. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H multiplet; 1.94 ppm, 2H) is consistent with a diketone structure.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces an elimination reaction in the diketone, forming a conjugated diene (product 2). This step converts the diketone into a bicyclic diene structure.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of the diene (product 2) cleaves the double bonds, forming a diketone (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl and couples with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group directly adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens from the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet splitting pattern. There is no evidence of additional couplings that would result in a more complex pattern like a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
