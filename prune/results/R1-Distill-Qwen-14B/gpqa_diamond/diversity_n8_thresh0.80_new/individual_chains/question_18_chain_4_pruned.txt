Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the question says we've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass more than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But I don't think the masses are super relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances, right? So maybe I can ignore the mass part for now.

The given data includes these abundances:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, no, I think the way it's written is that the value is 12 plus log(nX/nH) equals those numbers. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) would be 7.5 -12? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = (value -12). So for Fe, it's 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Because 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, it's 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the logarithmic scales. The [X/Y] notation is log(nX/nY) in dex. Right, the brackets mean log base 10 of (nX/nY) divided by the solar ratio. Or wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundance X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no, I think it's
