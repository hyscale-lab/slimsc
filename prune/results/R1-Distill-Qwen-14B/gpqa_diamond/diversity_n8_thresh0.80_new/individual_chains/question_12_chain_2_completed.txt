Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, conservation laws come into play—like conservation of energy and momentum. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. So the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, I think. Wait, neutrinos are super light, sometimes considered massless in these kinds of problems, unless stated otherwise.

So the decay equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is so light, maybe its energy is approximately equal to its momentum in units where c=1.

Let me recall the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and neutrino must add up to this. But the muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have energy equal to its momentum (since for massless particles, E = |p| c, but again, units here probably have c=1, so E = p).

Wait, but I think in particle physics, especially in these decay problems, we can use the invariant mass equation or maybe some energy-momentum conservation techniques.

So, let me set up the equations.

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (but c² is 1 in these units, so just 139.6 MeV)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu ≈ 0 (assuming it's massless)

The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. So the mu and nu must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_pi is just m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, in units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

E_nu would be sqrt(p² + 0) = p, since m_nu is zero.

So energy equation:
139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, okay, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Once I find p, I can find the energies of each particle and then subtract their rest masses to get the kinetic energy.

Let me write the equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me call sqrt(p² + 105.7²) as S. So, S + p = 139.6 → S = 139.6 - p.

But S is sqrt(p² + 105.7²), so square both sides:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * p + p² = p² + (105.7)^2.

Subtract p² from both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6 p = 105.7².

Compute the squares:

139.6^2 = let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16? Wait, but 139.6 is actually 139.6, which is 139 + 0.6. Alternatively, I'll just compute it as 139.6 * 139.6.

Well, 139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4)^2
= 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4²
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16
= 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and the cross term 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105+0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49= 11172.49.

So plugging in:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49.

So 2*139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 *139.6 p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).

Calculate denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

What's 8315.67 ÷ 279.2?

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So approx 29.8?

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 279.2 * 29.8: 279.2 *30=8376. So 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2)= 8376 -55.84=8320.16.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16.

So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So trying 29.77: 279.2 *0.03= 8.376, so 279.2 *29.77= 279.2*(29.8-0.03)= 8320.16 - 8.376=8311.784.

Hmm, 8311.784 is 3.886 less than 8315.67.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Divide numerator and denominator by 279.2:

8315.67 /279.2 ≈ let me compute it as 8315.67 ÷ 280 ≈ 29.7.

Wait, 280 *29.7 =8316.

So 279.2 *29.7 = approx 8315.67.

Wait, wait, 279.2 *29.7 → 279.2*(30-0.3)= 8376 - 83.76= 8292.24.

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I should just compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

To compute this, let me try it as:

279.2 = approx 280 -0.8.

So 8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 8315.67 / (280*(1 - 0.8/280)) ) → but maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

279.2 * 29 = 8100 + (279.2 *9) → 279.2*20=5584, 279.2*9=2512.8 → 5584+2512.8=8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 8096.8; 279.2 *30=8096.8 +279.2=8376.

We have 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, that can't be right because the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Its energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2).

Compute that:

29.78^2 ≈ 886.4.

105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49.

So sum is 886.4 + 11172.49 = 12058.89.

Square root of 12058.89 is about 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu =109.81 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7, so kinetic energy is 109.81-105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. Let me check the options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B)7.2,32.8

C)3.52,20.8

D)4.12,29.8

So D is 4.12 and 29.8. Which matches closely with my calculation of 4.11 and 29.78.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV. But wait, neutrinos don't have rest mass, so their energy is all kinetic. So the product particles' KE are muon (4.12) and neutrino (29.8). So the option D says that.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says KE of product particles are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, when I computed p, I got approximately 29.78 MeV/c, which is about 29.8. And the muon's energy is sqrt(29.78² +105.7²)= sqrt(886.4 +11172.49)= sqrt(12058.89)=109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV. Close to 4.12.

So option D is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺) into a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as:

- \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]
   Since the neutrino is massless, \( E_{\nu} = p \), where \( p \) is its momentum. For the muon, \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is initially at rest, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p.
   \]

### Solving for \( p \)
Using the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]
Let \( S = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} \). Then:
\[
S = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 8315.67.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Muon Energy**: The muon's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   29.78^2 \approx 886.4, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.4 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.89} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Energy**: The neutrino's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Matching with Options
The calculated kinetic energies are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) for the muon and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \) for the neutrino. These values closely match the values in **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).
