Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. And |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. 

Wait, so the state is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal basis vectors. The first thing I think is that I need to find the coefficients and then normalize the state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. 

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. To normalize, I need to calculate the inner product of this state with itself. The inner product is (1+i)(1−i) + (2−i)(2+i), because |up> and |down> are orthogonal. 

Calculating each part: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Because (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but since i^2 is -1, it's (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. 

Then (2−i)(2+i) = (2)² + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. Because (a - b)(a + b)=a² + b² when b is imaginary. 

So the total inner product is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Thus, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that matrix is 2x2 because we have two basis states. Let me think—what is this operator? 

The matrix A has 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So in terms of the basis |up> and |down>, the matrix looks like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Wait, that's A. So this is an operator that's (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Because the off-diagonal terms are ħ/2, which come from these outer products. 

Hmm, what's this operator? The spin operator in the x-direction is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Oh right! So A is the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, which are the eigenstates of the operator |up><down| + |down><up|. 

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of A? The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). 

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues. Wait, what are the eigenvalues of A? Because A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are 1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)*(-1) = -ħ/2. 

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenvalues are indeed ±1. So A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when the question refers to the eigenstates of the operator, they mean these |+x> and |-x> states.

But the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>. Because the measurement probabilities are the square of the coefficients in that expansion.

So first, let's find |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

We need to find c_+ and c_-.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate to get the coefficients.

Given that |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So that becomes: [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Wait, because < up | up > is 1, < down | down > is 1, and the cross terms (like < up | down >) are zero because they are orthogonal.

So:

(1+i) comes from < up | (1+i)|up>, and < up | (2 -i)|down> is zero. Similarly, < down | (1+i)|up> is zero and < down | (2 -i)|down> is (2 -i).

So summing (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, but wait, that's [3] / (sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So this becomes: [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Calculating numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

And |c_-|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) ] has magnitude sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 )=sqrt(5). So |c_-|^2 = (5)/(14) ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is 0.64 if rounded to two decimal places. And 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36. 

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. 9/14 is 0.642857. So 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, so 0.36.

So the first part of the question's answer would be probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. But looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, let me check the other parts.

The question also asks for the average value of the operator A. The average value is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is represented by the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], then the expectation value is calculated as:

< A > = (1/7) [ (1+i)(2−i) + (2−i)(1+i) ] * ħ/2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to compute it using the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that A is a Hermitian operator, so the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities. Since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the expectation value would be (c_+^2 * ħ/2) + (c_-^2 * (-ħ/2)).

Wait, because c_+ is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and c_- is the amplitude for eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So the expectation value would be |c_+|^2*(ħ/2) + |c_-|^2*(-ħ/2).

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)* (ħ/2) ] /14.

Which is (4 * ħ/2 ) /14 = (2 ħ) /14 = ħ/7.

Wait, that's ħ divided by 7. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7, which matches.

But wait, wait: alternative way to compute <A> would be to use the matrix representation.

The expectation value <A> is given by:

<alpha| A |alpha> 

We can compute this as:

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, but normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So:

|alpha> = [ (1+i), (2−i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

So to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, we first compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)*(2−i), (ħ/2)*(1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

Because A acting on |up> gives (ħ/2)|down>, and on |down> gives (ħ/2)|up>. So:

A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ (2−i)|down> + (1+i)|up> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> with A |alpha>:

= [ (1+i)* (2−i) + (2−i)* (1+i) ] * (ħ/2) /7

Because |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2−i) ]^T / sqrt(7), and A|alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2−i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So the inner product is (1+i)(ħ/2)(2−i) + (2−i)(ħ/2)(1+i) ) / (7).

Factor ħ/2 out:

= (ħ/2) [ (1+i)(2−i) + (2−i)(1+i) ] /7

Compute each term:

(1+i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) → 2 -i +2i -i².

Since i² is -1, so it's 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

Similarly, (2−i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i → 2 +2i -i -i².

Which is 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

So adding them together: (3 +i) + (3 +i) =6 + 2i.

Wait, that's the numerator inside the brackets.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: I think I messed up. Because A |alpha> is (ħ/2) [ (2−i)|down> + (1+i)|up> ] / sqrt(7), and |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So when you compute the inner product, it's (1+i) * (ħ/2)(1+i) + (2−i) * (ħ/2)(2−i) ) /7.

Wait, no, because the first component of |alpha> is (1+i), and the first component of A|alpha> is (ħ/2)(2−i). Let me think again.

No, wait, the inner product is (1+i)* (ħ/2)(2−i) + (2−i)* (ħ/2)(1+i) ) /7.

Because |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2−i) ]^T, and A|alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2−i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]^T.

So the inner product would be (1+i)(ħ/2)(2−i) + (2−i)(ħ/2)(1+i) ) divided by 7 (because each is divided by sqrt(7)).

So computing each term:

Term 1: (1+i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 2 -i + 2i -i² → 2 +i +1=3 +i.

Term 2: (2−i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i → 2 +2i -i - (-1) → 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Wait, that's the same as term 1. So both terms are 3+i.

So the sum is (3+i)+(3+i)=6 + 2i.

Wait, but when multiplied by (ħ/2) and divided by 7, the expectation is (6+2i)(ħ/2)/7.

Wait, no: the calculation is [ (1+i)(2−i) + (2−i)(1+i) ] = (3+i) + (3+i) =6 +2i.

So the entire expectation value is (6 +2i) * (ħ/2) /7.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value should be real. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, so the vector is [1+i, 2−i]^T.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So when A acts on |alpha>, it multiplies each component:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2−i) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2−i) ) ]^T.

So that's [ (ħ/2)(2−i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]^T.

So the inner product <alpha | A | alpha> is (1+i)(ħ/2)(2−i) + (2−i)(ħ/2)(1+i) ), all divided by 7, because |alpha> is normalized.

So let's compute each part.

First term: (1+i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) → 2 -i +2i -i². i squared is -1, so this becomes 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Second term: (2−i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i →2+2i -i -(-1) → 2+ i +1 =3 +i.

So sum of the two terms: (3+i) + (3+i) =6 +2i.

So the inner product is (6 +2i) * (ħ/2) /7.

But wait, the expectation value is a real number, so why is this complex?

Ah, because I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because the expectation value of a Hermitian operator must be real.

Wait, maybe the initial approach using the expansion into eigenstates is easier and correct.

Earlier, I calculated |c_+|^2 = 9/14 and |c_-|^2=5/14.

The average value is |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2) = (9/14)(ħ/2) - (5/14)(ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) ) = (2/7)(ħ/2) ) → (2ħ)/(7*2) ) → ħ/7.

Which is real, as expected.

So the average value is ħ/7, matching option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A says '0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7', which matches these results.

Wait, but wait another thing: when I calculated the probabilities as 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357, but 9+5=14, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

So among the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check why when I computed the expectation using the matrix, I got a complex number. That must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my confusion arises because I forgot the normalization factor correctly. Let me recompute using the matrix approach correctly.

|alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, the inner product <alpha| is [ (1−i), (2 +i) ] / sqrt(7).

A |alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2−i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ] / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1−i) * (ħ/2)(2−i) + (2+i) * (ħ/2)(1+i) ] /7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2 → 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (1-3i)(ħ/2).

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i →2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) +3i →1 +3i.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (1+3i)(ħ/2).

So adding the two terms:

(1−3i)(ħ/2) + (1+3i)(ħ/2) = [ (1+1) + (-3i +3i) ] * (ħ/2) → 2 * (ħ/2) = ħ.

So the entire expectation value is ħ /7.

Ah, because the denominator is 7, so the total is (ħ) /7.

Which matches our previous result.

So the average value is ħ/7. So the correct option is A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we start with the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

where the normalization factor \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \) is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \).

### Step 1: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates of the Operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator corresponds to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the spin-\( x \) operator:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we calculate the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates:

1. Coefficient for \( |+x\rangle \):
   \[
   c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

2. Coefficient for \( |-x\rangle \):
   \[
   c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 2: Average Value of the Operator \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) of \( A \), the expectation value can also be expressed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{(9-5)\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
