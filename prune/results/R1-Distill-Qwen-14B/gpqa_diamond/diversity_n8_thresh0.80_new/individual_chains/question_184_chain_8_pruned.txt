Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, wait. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: in benzene, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are in positions 1,2,3, that would be adjacent in a meta arrangement? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho, meta, para to each other. But I might need to think about the synthesis steps.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1. Then, the nitro is at position 3 and the tert-butyl at position 2. So position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. That would arrange them as 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So their positions are adjacent in a way that ethoxy is at one position, nitro at the next, and tert-butyl in between, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is at position 1, the nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement around the benzene.

Wait, but when doing multiple substitutions on benzene, you have to consider the order of reactions and directing effects. Each substitution can affect where the next substituent will go.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's think about the steps involved. Each substituent is introduced through a substitution reaction, probably via electrophilic substitution. The directing effects of the substituents will determine where the next group adds.

So, the substituents in the target are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert
