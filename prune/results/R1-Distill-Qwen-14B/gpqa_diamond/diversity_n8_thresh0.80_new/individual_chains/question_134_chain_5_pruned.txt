Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, mixing all three? I'm a bit confused. Let me think this through.

I think the first step is to figure out which are the acids and which are the bases here. HCl is a strong acid, right? H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, since it's a metal hydroxide. So, the reaction would be between the acids and the base.

Wait, but wait—what's the stoichiometry here? I need to find the moles of each reactant. Because enthalpy depends on the amount that reacts.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with HCl: concentration is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M and 300 mL. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Wait, but sulfuric acid is diprotic. So each mole can donate two H+ ions. Oh, right! Because H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

And then Ba(OH)2: concentration 0.5 M, volume 200 mL. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH^- ions. So the total hydroxide ions from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the problem is that we have two acids and one base. So all the acids will react with the base, but I need to see which one is in excess.

Wait, the acid and base will neutralize each other. Let's see:

Total H+ from acids:
HCl provides 0.1 moles H+ (since it's monoprotic).
H2SO4 provides 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles H+.
Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

The base, Ba(OH)2, provides 0.2 moles OH-.

In neutralization, H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ and OH- will react. Let me calculate which is in excess.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

The OH- will be the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 moles OH- can react with 0.2 moles H+. That leaves 0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so maybe it's better to think in terms of equivalents. Let me recount.

Each HCl gives 1 H+ per mole, so 0.1 equivalents.
Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 equivalents.
Total H+ equivalents: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 equivalents.

So the OH- is 0.2 equivalents. H+ is 0.28. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. After reaction, all 0.2 OH- will react, and 0.08 H+ will remain.

But wait, does that matter? Because the question asks for enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of H+ reacting. Or perhaps it's the amount that actually reacts.

Alternatively
