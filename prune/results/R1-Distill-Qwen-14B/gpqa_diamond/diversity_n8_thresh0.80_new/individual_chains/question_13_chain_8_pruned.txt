Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, actually limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but more specifically, it's a bicyclic monoterpene, right? No, wait, I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Oh wait, limonene has a structure that's a bicyclic monoterpeneâ€”so it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration.

Limonene is (R)-configuration. So the starting molecule is (R)-Limonene. Then, it's dissolved in methanol and stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Okay, so that's a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst, and hydrogen is the reactant. So the limonene is going to undergo hydrogenation.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, so it's got a double bond. When hydrogenated, the double bond would add hydrogen across it, turning it into a single bond. So Limonene is probably a bicyclic diene or something similar. So when hydrogenated, it becomes bicyclic and saturated.

But wait, limonene's structure is a bicyclic system with one double bond. Let me think: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, which is a bicyclic compound. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something like that. Wait, no, actually, limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So the double bond is in a specific position. When hydrogenated, that double bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond.

So the product after hydrogenation would be bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Let me see, assuming that the hydrogenation is done with 1 equivalent of H2. So each molecule of limonene would add one equivalent of H2, meaning each double bond would add two H's. But if limonene has only one double bond, then hydrogenation would add two hydrogens, making it a single bond.

Wait, but the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. Hmm,
