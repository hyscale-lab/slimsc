Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C, and we’re asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄^3-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. Then, probably, I have to consider the phosphate species formed when these salts dissolve in water.

Let me start by calculating moles of each component.

Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Similarly, for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Na₂HPO4·2H2O: when it dissolves, what does it dissociate into?

KH₂PO4 when dissolved in water would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-. 

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, but wait, no, the 2H2O is part of the crystal structure, so when it dissolves, it releases HPO4^2-. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in the solution, the main phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, since these are a mix of different phosphate species, it's likely that they will form a buffer solution. The phosphate system has multiple dissociation steps.

Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, has three dissociations:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the relevant species here are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In a solution containing both a weak acid and its conjugate base, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be applied. But wait, which one is the acid and which is the base in this case?

Actually, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) with Ka2, and as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4) with Kb = Kw / Ka1.

Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) with Ka3, or as a base with Kb = Kw / Ka2.

Wait, but in this scenario, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with the relevant Ka being Ka2.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, and the pH can be determined using the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but since the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, maybe the pH is determined by their concentrations via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Once we know the pH, we can determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is that both salts contribute to the phosphate species. So first, I should calculate the concentrations of each in the solution.

So the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

Wait, but these are the concentrations in solution. So now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can find the pH of the solution, because this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2)=0.792, so 0.792 -8 → pKa2 is 7.208.

Wait, wait, let me calculate pKa2 correctly:

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Let me compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So the pKa is 7.208.

Now, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M, and [H2PO4^-] is 0.036675 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.02806) / (0.036675) ≈ 0.765.
