Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stellar abundances. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. The problem gives me some elemental abundance data using the EW method under LTE.

The abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2.

Wait, the notation [X/Y]_Z is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. Right, that's the standard way these abundances are presented.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Wait, but how do I compute that? Let me think. 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-4.5 is about 3.16e-5.
- Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5, which is 1e-5.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi/Star1) / (nSi/Star2) ? Or maybe Star1 to Star2 ratio? The way it's phrased: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So probably [Si/Star1] divided by [Si/Star2], but I need to compute each nSi relative to H for each star, then take the ratio.

Wait, but how do I find nSi for each star?

I think I need to
