Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which suggests maybe O-H or N-H stretching. But there's also a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That peak is usually indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 3400-2500 might be an O-H stretch if it's a carboxylic acid, because those typically show broad peaks. But sometimes alcohols have O-H stretching, but they're usually less strong. Also, 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid (like around 1700 cm-1) or maybe an ester (a bit higher). Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1â€”those might be aromatic C=C stretching, which are common in benzene rings.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR data is provided. Let me break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's pretty upfield for a proton. Broad singlet could indicate an exchange, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. So, that would fit with the IR's 1720 cm-1 peak. So maybe we have a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, two protons in a para position, each coupling to another, perhaps in a para-disubstituted ring.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, also aromatic, and 2H. So this might be the other pair of protons in the para positions, maybe ortho to substituents.

Wait, putting 8.0 and 7.2 together, that's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. Like in benzoic acid derivatives. For example, if you have two substituents in para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. Let me think: if the substituents are electron-withdrawing, the protons would be deshielded and appear upfield. Wait, no, actually, electron-withdrawing groups like -COOH would deshield the ring, causing the protons to appear downfield. So, if the ring has a substituent in the para position, then the two ortho protons would be deshielded and appear as a doublet around 8.0 ppm and maybe the other two (meta?) but wait, in a para-substituted ring, the adjacent protons are ortho.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but the 1H NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, like a para-dimethyl or something else. Hmm.

Looking further into the NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That's a bit downfield, maybe a CH next to an electronegative group or in a chiral environment.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, 2H. Maybe part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH or CO group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. So that's likely a CH3 group attached to a CH, perhaps as in an isopropyl group. Because a doublet (d) suggests two neighboring protons. Wait, but in an isopropyl group, the central CH would have two CH3 groups attached. No, wait, actually, a doublet for CH3 might be if it's attached to a CH which is connected to another group. For example, in a CH(CH3)2 group, the CH3 would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but if the CH has two CH3 groups, each CH3 would be split. Hmm, but wait this is a doublet for 3H, so maybe a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. Like in an isopropyl group, the CH3 would be a triplet, but that's when the middle CH is connected to two other CH2 or CH groups. Alternatively, maybe a CH3 attached to a CH that's part of a larger structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. So perhaps an ethyl group at the end of a longer chain.

Putting all the NMR data together, let's try to construct the structure. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say the substituents are at positions 1 and 3? No, wait, para is positions 1 and 4. Wait, a para-substituted benzene has substituents opposite each other, so the ring would have two substituents across from each other. But wait, in the NMR, we have two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, for example, like in isopropyl benzene or something. Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent. Let me think: the IR has a 1720 peak, which suggests a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH would have a broad peak around 10.5 ppm. So that fits the NMR at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group in one para position, and another substituent in the opposite position. Let's consider that.

Now, looking at the NMR for the non-aromatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps the other substituent is an ethyl or isopropyl group.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggest an ethyl chain. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think: the structure could be something like a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH2CH3 group in para positions. But wait, the 2.9 ppm is a 1H, so maybe a branching point.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an isopropyl group. Let's see: an isopropyl group would have a central CH connected to two CH3 groups. The CH would be at around 2.1 ppm perhaps, but in this case, it's 2.9. Hmm, maybe it's a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) might be part of a longer chain. Let's consider the substituent as a propyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to the benzene, and 0.9 is the terminal CH3. So the substituent would be a propyl group attached via a CH2. So, the structure might be benzene with a -CH2CH2CH3 and a -COOH in para positions.

Wait, but then the 2.9 ppm (
