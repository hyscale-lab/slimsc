Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question has two parts. The first part is a reaction between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second part is a reaction involving 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. We have to find the major products A and B and choose the correct option among A, B, C, D.

I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK).

So, when I see t-BuOK (tert-butoxide), which is a strong, bulky base, I'm thinking it's probably a base-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative, which is a cyclic ketone. The substituents are 2-ethyl, 2-methyl, and 6-methyl. Wait, no: the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone is at position 1 (so the ketone is on carbon 1), and the substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl, so positions 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl? Wait, wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Oh, right, so position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1. At C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. At C6, another methyl group.

So the molecule looks like this: position 1 is the ketone (O), position 2 has ethyl and methyl, and position 6 has a methyl. So positions 2 and 6 are both substituted. Now, what reaction is this setup for?

Ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester. Acrylates are Michael acceptors, which can undergo conjugate addition reactions. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, which can also undergo aldol reactions. But with a bulky base like t-BuOK, maybe it's more about the aldol reaction, but wait, in aldol, the base deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, but in the presence of a Michael acceptor, perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts the alpha hydrogen from the cyclohexanone, leading to an enolate. Then, the enolate attacks the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate, when it forms, would attack the alpha position of the acrylate. That is, the enolate would attack the acrylate in a conjugate addition (Michael addition), because the enolate is a strong nucleophile.

So, the cyclohexanone will form an enolate. The base (t-BuOK) will deprotonate the alpha position, which is adjacent to the ketone. The alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6 in the cyclohexanone (since the ketone is at 1), but wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6, meaning that the alpha positions (which are next to the ketone) are perhaps the carbons adjacent to C1. So, in cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6 (each adjacent to C1). But the substituents are at C2 and C6, which could affect the acidity of the alpha hydrogens.

Wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, C1 is the carbonyl. So
