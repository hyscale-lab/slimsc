Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's see. I remember that mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. The question says Mike created an ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles are still there.

So, the mean free path λ is calculated based on the pressure, volume, and temperature. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Oh wait, but wait, when the electron beam is on, does that change anything about the gas?

Mike noticed that when the electron beam was initiated, the mean free path became λ2 instead of staying at λ1. The sample temperature was the same, so T didn't change. So why would λ change?

Oh! Maybe the electron beam is causing some kind of interaction with the gas molecules. Like, perhaps the electrons are scattering off the gas particles more, so the effective pressure isn't the same anymore. Wait, but in the initial state, the pressure was already very low. So when the beam is on, maybe the gas gets ionized or excited. Or maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more, increasing the effective pressure?

Wait, but the pressure in the sample compartment is fixed because the pumps are maintaining it. Unless the electron beam somehow creates a different environment. Oh! Oh wait, the mean free path formula I remember also depends on the pressure. Pressure is force per area, and in this case, the pressure is the same before and after the beam is turned on. So why is the mean free path changing?

Wait another thought. Oh, could it be that when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules? But the problem states that the temperature remained the same, so maybe that's not it. Or perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster, thereby increasing the effective temperature, but the overall system's temperature is measured as the same. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam changes the way gas particles interact. Like, maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to have more collisions than before. But wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the number of collisions. If the beam is adding another source of collisions, that would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, so in the initial state (without the beam), the mean free path is λ1. Then, when the beam is on, the gas molecules might be colliding more often with the electrons as well as with each other. But wait, electrons are much lighter than gas molecules. Do the gas molecules scatter electrons more? Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to ionize, creating charged particles, which might affect the collision rates.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure because the electrons are contributing to the pressure. Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is still the same, so that might not be the case.

Wait, another angle: in high vacuum conditions, the mean free path is determined by the gas molecules colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons can also collide with the gas molecules. So the effective scattering isn't just between gas molecules but also gas-electron interactions. So the mean free path for the gas molecules would be affected by these additional collisions.

So, if the gas molecules are now colliding not only with each other but also with electrons, the effective mean free path would be shorter. Because more frequent collisions (from both sources) would mean a smaller mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path in the initial case λ1 was calculated without considering the electron beam. When the beam is on, the gas molecules would have more collisions, so the mean free path λ2 should be shorter than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

So looking at the options: option C says λ2 < λ1. That would be the correct conclusion.

Wait, but I should think through the formulas. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the temperature. Since T is the same, and pressure is same, why would λ change?

Oh! Wait, perhaps because when the electron beam is on, the gas particles are subjected to additional forces. Like, the electric field from the beam could cause the gas to be ionized, leading to charged particles. Charged particles would interact more strongly, leading to more frequent collisions. So the effective pressure increases because the ionized particles might contribute more to the pressure. Or perhaps the presence of the beam increases the effective pressure.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam may cause gas molecules to have more momentum, leading to more frequent collisions, thereby reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but the formula I thought of earlier λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P) might not account for other factors like the presence of an electron beam. So if the beam effectively increases the collision rate, the mean free path would decrease.

So yes, λ2 would be less than λ1. So the answer is C.


The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by factors such as temperature (T), pressure (P), and molecular diameter (d). In this scenario, Mike observed that the mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2 when the electron beam was initiated, despite the temperature remaining constant. The key to understanding this change lies in the additional interactions introduced by the electron beam.

Initially, in the ultra-high vacuum state, the mean free path λ1 was determined based on gas-gas collisions. However, when the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules interact not only with each other but also with the electrons. These additional gas-electron interactions introduce new collision mechanisms, increasing the overall collision rate. As a result, the effective mean free path for the gas molecules decreases because they collide more frequently, either with each other or with the electrons.

Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate, the introduction of additional collisions due to the electron beam causes λ2 to be shorter than λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
