Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And X is lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that's Li-6? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the first thing I need to find is gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's compute that. 

v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me be precise. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, the problem is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so it's providing the kinetic energy to the ions. Or wait, wait—the problem says the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think the question is asking for the total energy or the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, the options are in GeV. Let me think. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, sometimes they refer to the kinetic energy, sometimes the total energy. But I think for heavy ions, it's more likely to be the total energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question states, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy given would relate to the kinetic energy, since the speed relates to the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, maybe it's the total energy. Let me clarify.

In relativity, the total energy is gamma * m0c², which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m0c². So which one is the question asking for? The question says, 'the energy of RHIC'—I think RHIC provides the kinetic energy to the ions. Because when you say the energy an accelerator provides, it's the kinetic energy imparted. So I think we need to compute the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) m0 c².

But wait, the speed is given, so the gamma is known. So I need to find the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) m0 c².

So m0 is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let's find m0. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is known, and 1 u ≈ 931
