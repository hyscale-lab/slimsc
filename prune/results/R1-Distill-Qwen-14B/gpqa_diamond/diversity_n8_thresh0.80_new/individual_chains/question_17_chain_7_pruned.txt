Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the problem says the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, what's the formula for the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So the complex is formed when Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combine. Since the solution is at stoichiometric concentration, I think that means the initial concentrations are in a 1:1 ratio. So the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. But wait, in solution, some of that will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if Kf is so large, like 5e10, that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation will be minimal. That means the concentration of free Ca^2+ will be really low. So the free [Ca^2+] is going to be small compared to the complex concentration.

Let me model this. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M initially. But when it dissociates, each complex gives one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-. So the change would be:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

But wait, if Kf is so large, x must be really small compared to 0.02. So maybe I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would simplify the equation.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Set that equal to 5e10. So 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Wait, let's compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12, which is 0.4e-12. Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.4e-12) would be sqrt(0.4)*1e-6. What's sqrt(0.4)? It's about 0.6325. So x ≈ 0.6325e-6 M, which is 6.325e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

Wait, but let me check if the approximation holds. We assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02, which it is because 6.3e-7 is way less than 0.02. So the approximation is valid. So option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Since \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, and \( x \) is much smaller than 0.02. Thus, we approximate \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \). Substituting into the formation constant equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times
