Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. 

First step: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, to form alkenes. So, two bromines on adjacent carbons would eliminate, forming a double bond. So product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, maybe 1,3-diene? No, wait, no, let me think. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So when KOH is used, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. So elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Br's were. So product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's 1,3-cyclohexadiene? Wait, no, adamantane is more complex, but the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3, but that might not be possible because in adamantane, C1 and C3 are probably not adjacent. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Oh, adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So the 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two opposite positions. So when elimination occurs, perhaps the structure becomes a bridge with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a di-elimination, but perhaps the product is a bicyclic diene. Or maybe the product is 1,3-diamantadiene? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a more conjugated structure. 

But regardless, the product has a 1H NMR spectrum with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). There's also a strong IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which typically indicates
