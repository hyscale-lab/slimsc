Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction is telling me. Let's break down each part.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8 for A and B. So the reaction is probably A + 8B → C.

2. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - So, the stoichiometry here might be C + 2D → E.

3. Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
   - So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

4. Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.
   - So, D + B → H.

I need to figure out what the substances are. Let's think about common chemicals that fit these descriptions.

Starting with Reaction 4. D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D and B are gases. So perhaps they're reacting to form something like HCl? Wait, but H is a solvent. Maybe D is H2O and B is something else? No, wait, B is a gas. Let's think of gas reactions that form solvents.

Wait, another approach. Maybe B is a gas like Cl2, D is something else. Or another possibility: B is O2, D is H2. But wait, O2 and H2 would form H2O. Then H would be water, which is a solvent. That makes sense. Let's explore this.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then Reaction 4 is O2 + H2 → H2O. But wait, O2 and H2 don't react unless catalyzed. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, Cl2 and H2O under certain conditions can react, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe B is a halogen. Let's think about A reacting with 8 equivalents of B. Like sulfur reacting with something. Wait, another angle: what's a bright red product C when A reacts with B?

Wait, bright red products in chemistry are often things like chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), which is green, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal oxide or some transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a metal sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). But sodium reacts with chlorine in a 1:1 ratio, I think. So that wouldn't give 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is Fe (iron) and B is O2? But 8 equivalents would be a lot. Iron reacting with O2 forms Fe3O4, which is black, not bright red.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about Reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, and two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So when C is hydrated, it produces A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH, H2CO3, H3PO4, etc.

So if C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong and a weak acid. Let me think. For example, if C is a sulfite salt, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate salt, but upon hydrolysis, perhaps it gives a strong acid and another. Or maybe C is a sulfate salt? Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about products
