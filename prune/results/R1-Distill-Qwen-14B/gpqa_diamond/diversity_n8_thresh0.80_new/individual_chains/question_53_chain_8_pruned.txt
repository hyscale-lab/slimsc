Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an OCOOR group somewhere. Esters typically show strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two signals correspond to aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in certain positions. The aromatic protons could be ortho, meta, or para to each other. The number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. For example, in para-substituted benzene, you might have two sets of aromatic protons if the substituents are symmetric. Wait, but di-substituted can be either ortho, meta, or para. Let me think about that.

If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons might be split into two sets. Like, if the substituents are two groups that are the same, then the ring would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon. So for para substituents, the aromatic region would show two sets: the protons adjacent to substituents (maybe as a doublet) and the others as a doublet or something else. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, the splitting could be more complex. But in this case, the NMR shows two aromatic signals, so maybe it's a para substitution with two sets of equivalent protons.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, no, esters don't have vinyl protons. Oh, wait, maybe the substituents on the benzene are an ester and another group that has a double bond. Or perhaps it's an ester group attached via a double bond, like an acrylate ester. Alternatively, maybe one of the substituents is an ester and another is an ethyl group with a double bond.

Wait, let's think. The NMR shows two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests some coupling. Maybe a trans configuration, like in a double bond. For example, in an ester group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOO-. Or perhaps part of a substituent like -CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, that doesn't have vinyl protons. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the ester is connected to a vinyl group, like a styrene-type structure.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is something like -OOCR where R has a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. So, for example, the substituent might be OCOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that wouldn't have vinyl protons. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with an ester and a vinyl group as substituents. Wait, but the
