Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might correspond to aromatic C=C stretches.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely a carboxylic acid proton. So that's a strong hint that the compound has a -COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. The higher chemical shift (8.0) is probably the protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The lower shift (7.2) would be the other two para protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 3-2 ppm range could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, or maybe part of a substituent like a CH2CH2 group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps part of a chain, maybe CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with a triplet integration of 3H suggests a CH(CH3) group. Like maybe a -CH(CH3)2 or similar.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet here is typical for a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group. The 10.5 ppm peak confirms a carboxylic acid. So the structure might be something like a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the substituents: The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) and 1.7 (m,2H) could be part of a chain attached to the ring. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is in turn attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain. So maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)2 or similar.

Wait, so maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: The 1.4 ppm is a CH(CH3) group (doublet), and the 1.7 ppm is two H's, perhaps part of a CH2. The 2.9 ppm is a CH that's attached to another CH2 group. So putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group? No, maybe another arrangement. Alternatively, the substituent could be something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, let's try to sketch this. The para-substituted benzene has a carboxylic acid group. Then, another substituent is attached, perhaps as an ethyl group with a branch. Alternatively, the substituent could be a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3) group, which would give the NMR signals we're seeing.

Wait, so the structure might be something like 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's see: The substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group? Or maybe a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch, like a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring, so maybe it's a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)- group, but that would be a tert-butyl group if it's a branch. Hmm, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which could be a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 is a triplet, so maybe that's the end of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted with a COOH group and another group. The substituents are in the para positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows only two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. So the structure is likely 4-substituted benzoic acid.

The substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. The substituent must account for the remaining NMR signals.

So, the substituent is a group that has a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- structure? Or perhaps a CH(CH2CH2CH3
