Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology constructs and their expression in mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think this through step by step.

Alright, the question is about a bicistronic vector they created. Bicistronic means it has two genes, right? So the ligand and the receptor are both in this vector. The vector uses lox-P sites and stop cassettes. I remember lox-P is involved in Cre/Lox recombination. So when Cre is expressed, it cuts the lox sites and deletes the surrounding regions.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Oh wait, but there's a stop cassette with loxP between the ligand and mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Wait, no, actually, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So when the vector is transfected into cells, the ligand is expressed, followed by mCherry only if the stop is removed. But in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette is in place, so mCherry isn't expressed with the ligand. Or wait, actually, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe each gene is expressed under separate promoters? Hmm, no. Wait, bicistronic vectors usually have a single promoter driving two cistrons, each with their own start codon and sometimes internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something like that.

Wait, the setup says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the first gene, ligand, is under the CBA promoter. Then after that, it's the receptor under the IRES. So the vector is probably set up as: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette with loxP -> mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor ORF with a stop, then eGFP with lox2272.

Wait, maybe the structure is like:

CBA promoter --> ligand ORF --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry ORF

IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP ORF

So when the vector is introduced into cells, the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand. The ligand is followed by a stop, which without Cre, prevents mCherry from being expressed. The IRES probably allows for the expression of the receptor. So the receptor is expressed under the IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for some expression.

Wait, but in the question, they used a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor. So the ligand is at the 5' end, under CBA promoter, then after the ligand comes the stop cassette, then mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor is expressed, followed by another stop cassette, then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites. For the ligand-mCherry part: the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not. If Cre is present, it will delete the stop, so both ligand and mCherry are expressed, in frame? Or perhaps mCherry is just expressed as a separate part.

Wait, but the question is about the expression in the mouse model. They made a mouse homozygous for their construct in the wild-type background. Then crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the Cre is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, recombining the lox sites.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is introduced, so the stop cassettes would be removed. For the ligand part: the stop between ligand and mCherry is flanked by loxP, so Cre would delete it, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor-eGFP part, the stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre (loxP) can also cut, allowing eGFP to be expressed in frame with the receptor? Or wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, I think, but Cre can still recombine it.

Wait, but the answer options mention eGFP not being expressed. So in the experiment, after crossing, they visualize under confocal and don't see green (which I think is eGFP). So the green would be from the receptor-eGFP construct.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed? Let's think about the construct.

In the vector, the receptor has a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) before the eGFP. So without Cre, the stop would prevent eGFP expression. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together. But if the stop isn't removed, eGFP won't be expressed.

But the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which presumably express Cre under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So when the Cre is active, it should recombine the lox sites.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous. So the construct is in both alleles. So when Cre is introduced, both alleles would have the lox sites recombined. So the eGFP should be expressed.

So why isn't the green signal observed? Maybe the construct isn't getting into the right cells, or the expression isn't happening.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship: Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression of the fluorescent proteins. It doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP signal.

B) receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi: That would mean it's not expressed on the cell surface, so not fluorescent in the confocal. But the question says that they are using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Wait, no, in the Western blot, they used the antibodies and saw expression. Wait, the question says that after transfection to primary astrocyte cultures, they tested by Western blot. The Western blot showed expression proportional to actin. So both the ligand and receptor were expressed, because they used antibodies against both.

Wait, but in the mouse,
