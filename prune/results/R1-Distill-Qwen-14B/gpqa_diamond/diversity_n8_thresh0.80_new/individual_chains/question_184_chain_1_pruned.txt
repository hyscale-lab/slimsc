Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. 

First, I should probably sketch the structure to better visualize the substituents. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would matter. Let me number it such that the substituents are in the correct positions. Let's see: the target is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,2,3 positions. Oh, I think the numbering in the name should be such that the substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3, making them adjacent. Wait, but the substituents are tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions of benzene. 

But wait, substituents on benzene can't all be adjacent, right? Because benzene is a six-membered ring, so each position is adjacent to two others. So positions 1,2,3 would be adjacent, but how? Let me think. So if the ring is numbered clockwise, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So substituents are in adjacent positions, which is possible.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. I need to add these substituents in the correct order. The key here is the order of electrophilic substitution reactions because each new substituent will direct the next substitution. 

Let me recall: substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors. Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is an activating, but wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's
