Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so let's break that down. The molecular formula tells us the number of each type of atom. So, 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. 

The question gives the NMR data, which I should look at closely. The 1H NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about what these signals could mean.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO), since aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The fact that it's a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually don't have many neighboring protons because they're at the end. Oh, wait, unless it's conjugated or something else. Or perhaps it's a different functional group? Maybe an acidic proton like an enol or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde next to a CH2 group. Because if the aldehyde is next to a CH2, the aldehyde proton would be split by the adjacent two protons. So, RCH2CHO would lead to the aldehyde proton being a triplet. Or perhaps a conjugated aldehyde? Not sure yet.

Looking at the other signals:

The two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm. Those are probably aromatic protons. Let me think, a doublet for two protons each. So maybe two sets of aromatic protons, each being a pair. So perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene ring, where each pair is a doublet. Like, for example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent causing a pair of protons to be equivalent.

Wait, or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, like para-substituted, where each substituent is in the para position. So each pair of protons is in a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling between two aromatic rings. Wait, maybe the compound has two aromatic rings connected by a chain.

Looking further, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for two protons. Broad usually indicates exchange, like an -OH group, but two protons might be a di-substituted group. Wait, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's an aromatic ring with two protons that don't split each other, but maybe they are adjacent to something else. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom. Or maybe it's an enol tautomer, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with an adjacent group. Hmm.
