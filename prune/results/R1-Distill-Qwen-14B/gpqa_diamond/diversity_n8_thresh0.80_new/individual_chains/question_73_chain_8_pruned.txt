Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use special relativity equations.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Right, the formula for adding velocities is different. The formula for the relative velocity u' when observed from one frame moving at speed u with respect to another frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of one object relative to another moving at speed v.

So here, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, adjusted by the relativity formula. Let me assign their velocities first. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, wait. A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that denominator first. (0.5*0.6)=0.3, so 0.3c²/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1-0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is -0.1c. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're talking about speed, we take the magnitude. So about 0.14c. Wait, but looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed. So that's either option C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies
