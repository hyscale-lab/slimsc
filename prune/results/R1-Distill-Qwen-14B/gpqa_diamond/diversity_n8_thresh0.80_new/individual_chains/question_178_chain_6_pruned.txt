Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So this must be some kind of interaction term between a fermion field ψ and a boson field, perhaps a photon or something similar since F is the field strength tensor.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should recall how to find the dimensions of terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1), so the integral over 4 dimensions (d^4x) requires the Lagrangian density to have dimension 4.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field in the term has its own dimension. For fermions (like ψ), the mass dimension is 3/2 each. Because the Lagrangian has dimension 4, and the Dirac term in the free Lagrangian is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which has each ψ with dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is the same as ψ, so dimension 3/2 each.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, right? Because σ is a commutator of γ matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} has dimension 0. So when I multiply ψ̄ (3/2) with σ (0) and ψ (3/2), the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field like electromagnetism, F has dimensions of [mass]^2 because the field tensor is built from derivatives of the gauge field A, and each derivative is mass dimension 1. The abelian field strength is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each F has dimension 2 (because A has dimension 1; derivatives add 1 each, so 2 in total).

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by [ψ̄ σ ψ] which is dimension 3, multiplied by [F] which is dimension 2. So the entire term has dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5. But since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, we have [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the dimension step by step. The Lagrangian term is L = κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So each factor's dimension: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0 (since it's a product of gamma matrices), ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) =3. F is the field strength, which has dimension 2. So the product is 3 +2 =5. So κ must have dimension 4-5= -1. Yep, that's right.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be non-negative. That is, [κ] >=0.

Wait, wait no. Let me recall the rule. The mass dimension of the coupling constant in a renormalizable interaction is [g] >= - (number of fields in the term) + (something?).

Alternatively, in four dimensions, an interaction term is renormalizable if its coupling has positive or zero mass dimension. Because each coupling is part of an interaction term, and higher dimensions would mean that the term is nonrenormalizable (like higher derivative terms).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable only if its dimension is ≤4. Because the term is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. So for each term, the product of the coupling's dimension and the sum of the fields' dimensions must be less than or equal to 4.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the dimension of the coupling. For a term in the Lagrangian involving the coupling g and fields, the dimension is [g] + sum of [fields] =4. So if [g] is positive, then the sum of the fields' dimensions is less than 4. For renormalizable theories, the coupling's dimension must be >= 0. Because if [g] is negative, then the term would have more fields than allowed for renormalizability.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's think about the general form of an interaction term. It's something like g φ^n, where φ is a field. The dimension of the term must be 4. So [g] + n*[φ] =4. For renormalizability, each [g] must be >=0. Because if [g] is negative, then n*[φ] must be larger than 4, which implies that the term would have a higher dimension than 4, making it nonrenormalizable.
