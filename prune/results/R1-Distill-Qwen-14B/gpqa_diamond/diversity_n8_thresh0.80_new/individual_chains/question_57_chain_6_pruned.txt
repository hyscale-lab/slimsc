Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering, I think. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the right one.

Wait, elastic scattering means that the energy isn't lost, right? So it's all about how the electrons are deflected. Phase shifts come into play in quantum mechanics when dealing with scattering problems. I remember that the scattering amplitude is related to these phase shifts somehow.

The phase shifts given are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ =55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored, so I guess higher-order terms beyond l=4 don't matter here.

I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) in the case of elastic scattering can be expressed in terms of the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. But wait, for the direction along the incident beam, which is θ=0, I think.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f(s, t, u) in terms of phase shifts is something like a sum over l of (something). Or is it that each partial wave contributes? Oh, right, the partial wave expansion. The amplitude is a sum over angular momentum states.

The general form for f(θ, φ) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) [1 + ... ] Wait, but I think specifically, when calculating the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps we're considering the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f can be written as f = f_r + i f_i. The imaginary part of f along the direction of the incident beam—so the direction where θ is 0 degrees, and φ is the same as the beam direction, which I think would be φ=0, but perhaps that's not needed here because the problem says 'along the incident beam direction'. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(s, t, u) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) e^{2i
