Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are in this reaction. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, wait. First, I should double-check what the starting material is. The name given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene rings are numbered such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers, right? So 1-bromo-2-d... Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but I think d here refers to a deuterium? Or perhaps it's a typo. Maybe the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a strong base. This sounds like a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Since the starting material is an aryl bromide, maybe it's undergoing some kind of elimination.

Wait, but aryl halides are generally not as reactive towards elimination as alkyl halides. Unless this is some special case. Oh wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo elimination. For example, if there's a good leaving group attached in a position that allows for elimination, maybe forming a double bond.

Wait, but the starting compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium somewhere else. Or is it maybe benzene with bromine and another substituent, like a methyl group or something else that can undergo elimination?

Wait, maybe the "d" is a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? So, benzene with a Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2.

Wait, but then what's the reaction with NaNH2? NaNH2 is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation, but in aromatic substitution? Hmm, perhaps it's more about elimination reactions, but in aromatic compounds, elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the base is abstracting a proton, leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is not just bromobenzene but has adjacent substituents that can undergo elimination. Oh, maybe it's a bromide attached to a benzene ring that's also substituted with another group that can form a double bond upon elimination.

Wait, but the name 1-bromobenzene-2-d suggests that it's a benzene ring with Br in position 1 and a deutero group in position 2. So, Br at position 1, D at position 2. So, benzene ring with Br and D at adjacent positions.

So, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps it's causing elimination. But in benzene rings, elimination usually isn't possible because of the aromatic structure. Unless it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good solvent for elimination reactions.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but for aromatic compounds? Or maybe it's more about forming a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already all double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, wait! I remember that when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can eliminate two equivalents of HX (in this case, HBr) to form a triple bond, benzynelike structure, but that's a very reactive intermediate. But wait, in this case, the starting material is only mono-bromobenzene with a D in the adjacent position.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with something else. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are ortho to each other.

What happens when you have a Br on benzene and a deuterium adjacent to it? The base, NaNH2, would abstract a proton. But wait, the adjacent position has a D. Oh, so the base would abstract a proton from a neighboring position, but the position next to Br has a D. So perhaps the H being abstracted is from position 3 or 4?

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's beta to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr. But wait, benzene is a ring, so elimination would require adjacent leaving groups, perhaps? Or maybe in this case, since the D is in position 2, the H that's abstracted is from position 3, leading to elimination across positions 1 and 3, creating a double bond? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a vinyl group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the D is in the same position as a hydrogen that's abstracted. But if the D is there, the base would abstract a different H.

Wait, if the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the Br, then elimination would occur, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in benzene, that's already all double bonds, so maybe it's more about forming a triple bond or some kind of diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But in aromatic substitution, the leaving group is usually substituted by something else, but NaNH2 isn't a typical nucleophile in such reactions. Wait, but perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with a strong base, it might lose HBr, forming a double bond. But in benzene, all the bonds are equal, so perhaps forming a ring with an extra double bond elsewhere? Or maybe it forms a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where the Br was. So, if the Br is at position 1, the elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 has a D, not an H. So, if the H is abstracted from position 3, then elimination would form a double bond between positions 2 and 3? Or maybe positions 1 and 2.

But wait, if the D is at position 2, adjacent to Br at 1, then the H's available for abstraction would be from positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the Br. So, for example, position 2 has D, so the H's in position 3 are abstracted. So, the H in position 3 is taken by the base, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2 (since the Br leaves, and the H from 3 is abstracted). Wait, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a D, so maybe that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw this mentally. Benzene ring with Br at position 1, D at position 2. So positions around the ring are 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

If NaNH2 is a strong base, it'll abstract a proton that's a good candidate for elimination. The Br is a leaving group, so when the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the Br, say in position 3, then elimination would occur between position 1 and 3, forming a double bond between those positions. But wait, that's not adjacent. Or perhaps position 2 is next to 1, but it's a D, so the base can't abstract that.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 2 and 3. But position 2 has a D, not a proton. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 4. So, elimination between positions 1 and 4? But that's a meta position, which is not adjacent. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this reaction is not about elimination but about dehydrohalogenation in a way that forms a benzyne intermediate. But that usually requires two leaving groups, right? For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with strong base would lose two HBr to form benzyne.

But in this case, the starting material is only a mono-bromobenzene with a D in the adjacent position. Wait, but that would mean only one Br. So, can't form benzyne, which requires two leaving groups.

So, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe it's a substitution, but NaNH2 isn't a typical nucleophile. Wait, maybe it's a ring dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not a deuterium but a typo for something else, but the question states 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so probably it's a deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination of HBr, but where would that leave us? If Br is at position 1, and H is abstracted from position 2 (but position 2 has D, which is a heavy isotope; so maybe the H is abstracted from position 3.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, adjacent to position 2 (which has D), then elimination would form a double bond between 2 and 3. But wait, that would mean removing H from position 3 and Br from position 1? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination is between position 1 (Br) and position 3 (H), but that's not adjacent. I'm getting a bit lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a double bond forming between positions 1 and 2, but since position 2 has a D, that might complicate the reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile in such reactions. Unless it's a special case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a vinyl group, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If the reaction is elimination, perhaps we form a benzene ring with a double bond, but since the ring is already aromatic, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a triple bond, but that's not common.

Wait, another angle: maybe the D is a deuterium attached to the ring, and the reaction involves removing a hydrogen adjacent to the D. Then, the base abstracts a proton that leads to the formation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of a benzene ring with a vinyl group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the possible elimination products. If the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's already part of the ring, so maybe it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a substituent that's a double bond, like a styrene-like structure, but that's not quite right either.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't 1-bromo-2-d benzene but a different substitution pattern. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, the question doesn't say that.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the starting material's structure and the reaction mechanism. Let me try to summarize:

- Starting material: 1-bromobenzene-2-d (Br at position 1, D at position 2).
- Reagent: NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.
- Conditions: Strong base, probably leading to elimination.

But considering that, perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination where the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in this case, the adjacent position to Br (position 2) has a D, which isn't a proton, so the base would have to abstract a proton from the next available position, like position 3.

Elimination would then occur between position 1 (Br) and position 3 (where the H was abstracted), forming a double bond between positions 2 and 3. Wait, that doesn't quite add up. E2 elimination involves the base abstracting a proton that's anti to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond between the leaving group's carbon and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in an aromatic ring, all the carbons are equivalent in terms of structure, so the formation of a double bond would require breaking a sigma bond and creating a pi bond elsewhere. But this seems unlikely because the aromatic ring is stable. So perhaps the elimination doesn't involve the ring itself but a substituent attached to it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a substituent that can undergo elimination. For example, if instead of being a simple bromobenzene, the ring has a side chain. Let me think: 1-bromo-2-d benzene might actually be a benzene ring with a Br at position 1 and a CH2D group at position 2.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, position 2 has a CH2D group attached. Then, the Br is at position 1, and the substituent at position 2 is CH2D. In this case, the substituent is a CH2D group.

Now, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the CH2D group, leading to a vinyl group. So, elimination of HBr would occur, forming a double bond.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the substituent at position 2 is -CH2D. The base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from the adjacent CH2D group. Let me visualize this: the substituent is -CH2D at position 2, and the Br is at position 1.

So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with Br at position 1 and CH2D at position 2.

When the base abstracts a proton from the CH2D group, say the hydrogen on the CH2, that would lead to the formation of a double bond between the carbon at position 2 and the adjacent carbon (position 1, which is attached to Br). Wait, but position 1 is attached to Br, so perhaps elimination leads to the formation of a double bond between position 1 and position 2.

Wait, but position 1 is attached to Br, which is a good leaving group. So, in an E2 mechanism, the base abstracts a proton that's anti to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between the carbons attached to Br and the abstracted H.

In this case, the substituent is CH2D at position 2. So, the H is on the CH2D group. The base abstracts this H, leading to elimination of Br^- and formation of a double bond between position 1 and 2.

Wait, but that would form a double bond between the two attached positions. So, the benzene ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but since benzene is already a ring of double bonds, this might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent becomes a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, another way: the substituent is CH2D at position 2. The base abstracts a proton from the CH2D group, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So, the substituent would become CH2D with a double bond to the ring carbon, making it a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2D at position 2. Upon elimination, the substituent becomes -CH2D → -CH2D → after elimination, maybe it becomes a -CH= group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the substituent at position 2 would become -CH2D → after elimination, maybe it becomes a -CH2 group with a double bond to position 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. If the substituent at position 2 is CH2D, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2 group, then elimination of HBr would occur, forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons. So, the substituent would become a CH2 group connected via a double bond to position 1 (which has the Br). Wait, but that would make a transannular double bond, which might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a D, and elimination would form a double bond between the CH2 and the adjacent C (position 1, which is attached to Br).

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would have a double bond, making it a CH2=CH group attached to the ring? No, that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2D group attached to the benzene ring at position 2. The base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2D group. Then, elimination of HBr occurs, leading to the formation of a double bond between the position 2 (attached to CH2D) and position 1 (attached to Br). But in that case, the Br would leave, and the substituent would have a double bond to position 1, which is part of the aromatic ring.

Wait, but that would create a double bond between the substituent and the ring, making a vinyl group attached to the ring. So, the substituent would become a vinyl group, CH2D → CH2D → after elimination, becomes CH2 with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought. Maybe the NaNH2 isn't causing elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, and such reactions usually need activating groups on the ring, which aren't present here.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction leads to elimination, perhaps we get a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, or perhaps the ring itself undergoes some change. Alternatively, maybe the product is benzene with a deuterium and a Br, but that doesn't seem to involve any reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. But I don't recall such mechanisms for aromatic rings.

Wait, let me think about the possible products based on elimination. If the reaction is elimination, the possible products would depend on where the H is abstracted. Since the substituent at position 2 is CH2D, the available protons for abstraction are from the CH2 group. So, the base can abstract H from either the same side or different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but in a CH2D group, the two Hs are equivalent, so the elimination would lead to only one product, right?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2D group. So, when the base abstracts a H from CH2D, the substituent becomes CHD^-, and then elimination of Br^- occurs, leading to a double bond between position 1 and 2.

But wait, that would form a double bond between the ring carbon and the substituent, making it a vinyl group. So, the substituent would be =CH2D.

Wait, but that's not possible because the substituent is attached to the ring. Alternatively, the substituent would become a CH2 group with a double bond to the ring, making it a vinyl group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2D group, and elimination leads to a double bond between the ring and the substituent, making a vinyl group. So, the product would be benzene with a vinyl group at position 2 and a deuterium somewhere.

But wait, the starting material has Br at position 1 and CH2D at position 2. If elimination occurs, the Br leaves, and the substituent forms a double bond to position 1. So, the substituent would become CH2D → after elimination, it would be a CH2 group attached via a double bond to position 1. So, the substituent would be a vinyl group (CH2=) attached to position 1.

Wait, but position 1 is where the Br was, so the substituent would be attached to position 1 as a vinyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a vinyl group at position 2, and the Br is eliminated as HBr. Wait, but the starting material's substituent is at position 2, so elimination would affect that.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the key point is that the elimination leads to only one product. Because the substituent is CH2D, and the base can abstract only one H (since the other is D), leading to a single product.

Wait, but wait. The substituent is CH2D, so the H is attached to a carbon adjacent to the ring. When the base abstracts this H, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between the ring carbon (position 1) and the substituent's carbon (position 2). So, the substituent becomes a vinyl group, CH2= attached to position 1.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a vinyl group at position 1. But the original substituent was at position 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 2, and elimination leads to a double bond between position 2 and 1, so the substituent becomes a vinyl group at position 2, attached to position 1.

Wait, perhaps the product is benzene with a vinyl group at position 2.

But if the substituent is a CH2D group, and elimination occurs, the substituent would become CH2 group with a double bond to position 1. So, the product would be benzene with a vinyl group (CH2=) attached to position 1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2D group, and elimination leads to the formation of a double bond within the substituent itself. For example, the substituent could be CH2D → after elimination, it becomes a C≡C group. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the reaction doesn't involve the ring at all, but just the substituent. Let's imagine that the substituent is a CH2D group attached to benzene. Then, treating with NaNH2 would abstract a proton from CH2D, leading to the formation of a double bond in the substituent, making it a CH2 group with a double bond, i.e., a vinyl group.

So, the substituent would become CH2D → after elimination, perhaps it becomes CH2=CH group. Wait, but then that would require another substituent, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2D, and elimination leads to the formation of a double bond between the two CH2 groups, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the possible number of products. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to only one product, then the answer would be B)1. But if there are multiple sites for elimination, leading to different products, then the number would be higher.

Wait, going back to the starting material: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, Br is at position 1, and a deuterium is at position 2. If the deuterium is part of a substituent, like a CH2D group, then elimination would involve that substituent.

Assuming the substituent is CH2D, the base could abstract a proton from either the same position or another, but in this case, since the substituent is CH2D, the H can only be abstracted from one position, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 2, and the base can abstract a proton from either position 3 or another position, leading to different elimination products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted benzene with Br at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. But it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple elimination of HBr, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's already part of the aromatic structure.

I'm not making much progress. Let me consider that in benzene rings, elimination reactions usually don't occur because of the aromatic stability. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to no products, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's impossible because the ring is already fully conjugated. So maybe the reaction doesn't happen, but the question states that the reaction occurs, so products must form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium and a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution, but I can't see how that would work. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's not typical.

I think I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is only one product, so the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in elimination reactions. However, the aromatic nature of benzene makes direct elimination unusual, as the ring's stability typically resists such transformations.

The substituent at position 2 is interpreted as a CH₂D group. In this case, the base (NH₂⁻) can abstract a proton from the CH₂D group, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond. This elimination occurs between the carbon at position 1 (attached to Br) and the carbon at position 2 (attached to CH₂D), resulting in a vinyl group (-CH=) at position 2. Since the CH₂D group has two equivalent hydrogens, the elimination leads to only one product.

Given the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material, the elimination process produces a single organic product. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Answer: B
