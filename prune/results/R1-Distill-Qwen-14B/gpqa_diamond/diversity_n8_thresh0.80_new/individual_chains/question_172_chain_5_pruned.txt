Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium (LTE here). The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Since star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, maybe the ratio of their excitation is 2. But wait, I need to clarify what's exactly given. The problem states that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the excitation here refers to the population in a specific energy level. So for star 1, the number of iron atoms in that level is twice that of star 2. Let me denote the number as n1 and n2 for star 1 and 2 respectively. So n1 = 2*n2.

But wait, no. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think that means the excitation level is higher, so the fraction of atoms in the excited state is higher. So perhaps the ratio between the excited and ground states for star 1 is higher than for star 2. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation here refers to the energy level's excitation. So the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are in a higher energy state. But I'm not sure. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The Boltzmann factor equation is:

n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Here, n2 is the number in the higher energy state, n1 is the number in the lower state. Wait, no, wait: in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (E_upper - E_lower). So if ΔE is positive, then the ratio depends on temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is fixed for both stars, since it's the same energy levels being compared.

So the ratio for each star would be:

For star 1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. Hmm. I think that's referring to the ratio of the number in the excited state to the ground state. So, star_1 has twice the number in the excited state compared to star_2. Wait, but maybe not
