Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are about different power laws—like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same everywhere in the universe. But wait, when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform. Because as distance increases, the number of stars at a given distance would depend on how volume relates to distance.

Wait, parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So if I think about a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in distance? Let me think about it.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the surface area of that shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Surface area is 4πd², right? So the number of stars would be 4πd² * (number density) * dd. But since we're talking about per unit range of plx, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the equation. So the number of stars for a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (number density) * (dd), but wait, how does dd relate to dplx?

Wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if plx changes by dplx, then d changes by dd = - (dplx)/(d^2) ). Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd would be the derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that: dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. But since we're dealing with small ranges, the negative sign just indicates direction, so the magnitude is (dplx)/(plx^2).

So the number of stars in the thin shell at parallax plx would be:

Number = 4π (d^2) * (number density) * (dd)
= 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * n * (dplx / plx^2 )

So simplifying that, Number = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, so the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (like per dplx) is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the number per unit plx is not the same as the number per unit volume
