Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the reorganization of the alkene structure, right? So, Grubbs would help in breaking and reforming the double bonds.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain with the double bond starting at the first carbon. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, noâ€”wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh, pentane has five carbons. So, position 1 is the first carbon, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Let me count: 1 (double bond start), 2 (end of double bond), then 3 is CH(CH3), then 4 and 5. Wait, no, wait. Maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, maybe I should count correctly. Let's see: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the middle of the chain.

Wait, maybe I should write it down. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the chain longer. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I should count the carbons. Let me imagine the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Because C3 is the middle here. Let me check: the chain is five carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3,
