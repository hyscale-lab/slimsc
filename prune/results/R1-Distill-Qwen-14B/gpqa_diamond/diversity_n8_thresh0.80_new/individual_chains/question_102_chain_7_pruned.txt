Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a molecular biology experiment. Let's read through the question carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I think means it's a vector that can express two genes from a single transcriptional unit, right? So each gene is under its own promoter or something.

The vector's setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Wait, no. Wait, the ligand ORF is at the 5' and it's fused to mCherry. But wait, the way it's worded is a bit confusing. Oh, no, looking again: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Hmm, so the ligand is attached to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP.

Wait, but the promoters and the cassettes are a little tricky. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter that's constitutive, so it should be expressed regardless. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct without needing a second promoter. So, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, then IRES drives the receptor.

But there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, the stop is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

So, the setup is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, but the stop cassette would prevent the receptor from being expressed. Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Then after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), so the ligand is fused to mCherry. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed because the stop cassette would prevent that. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, excising the stop cassette, allowing the receptor ORF to be expressed along with eGFP.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the vector is designed. So, the vector is bicistronic, meaning two cistrons (two ORFs) in one transcript. The first cistron is ligand, then mCherry, but wait, no. Let me clarify:

The vector has the ligand's coding sequence (ORF) followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the receptor ORF followed by
