Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with relativity stuff. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, first, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, wait, but which one is v1 and which is v2 here? Oh, the problem says astronaut 1 has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is 3m at 0.5c. So I guess v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Wait, but wait, relative speed is from one's perspective to the other. So if I'm in the frame of astronaut 1, what speed is astronaut 2 moving at?

So applying the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c, which matches options C and D. So I can eliminate options A and B, which have relative speeds of 1.1c and 0.1c respectively. So now it's between C and D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in relativity, the energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to compute the energy for each and sum them up.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each energy.

For the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
v = 0.6c
v²/c² = 0.36
1 - 0.36 = 0.64
sqrt(0.64) is 0.8
So gamma = 1/0.8 = 1.25
Energy E1 = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):
v = 0.5c
v²/c² = 0.25
1 - 0.25 = 0.75
sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660 (since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660)
Gamma = 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547
Energy E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² = 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1.1547 multiplied by 3 is approximately 3.464, yes. So E1 + E2 is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is about 5.96 mc², which is option C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait
