Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They modified the gene by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this construct using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The question is why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D, and the given DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct.

Let me look at the problem. The main issue is that the protein isn't being expressed. So I need to look for possible reasons in the DNA sequence provided.

Looking at the sequence, it starts with ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. So that's correct. Let me see if there are any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence. If there's an early stop codon, the protein would be truncated and maybe not detected.

Let me scan the sequence. I'll go through and look for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

The sequence provided is a long stretch, so I'll go through it in sections.

Looking from the beginning:

...ATG... then I see some TAC, etc. Let me check for the stop codon sequences.

Wait, the first part: 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

I'll look through the sequence letter by letter for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC etc.

Wait, here's TGA right after the start. Let me look: the sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

So after the start codon (ATG), the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), then TGA.

TGA is a stop codon. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Because the sequence goes ATG ... TGA, which is a stop codon, so the ribosome would terminate translation early.

So the issue is that there's a TGA in the coding sequence, which would cause the protein to be truncated early. Wait, but in which frame? Because the start codon is ATG, the reading frame is set, and any TGA would be a stop if it's in the same frame.

Looking at the sequence again, the start codon is ATG, then the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc., then after some, we hit AAA (K), then TGA (stop).

So the ribosome would translate until the TGA, which is much earlier than the end of the sequence, which suggests that the construct ends with TGA as well, but wait, the given sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA. GAG is glutamic acid, TGA is a stop codon. So wait, perhaps the TGA is at the end, but there's another TGA earlier.

Wait, let me find all TGA in the sequence. Let me look through the entire sequence for TGA. The first occurrence is at position where the sequence reads ...AAA TGA CTC ...

Wait, the 'AAA TGA CTC' is part of the sequence. So that's a TGA in the same frame as the ATG start codon, which would cause translation to terminate there, resulting in a truncated protein. So the construct has an internal stop codon (TGA) early in the sequence, which would make the expressed protein short and perhaps not detected, leading to the inability to overexpress.

But wait, the question says that the construct has the hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So perhaps the TGA is in the middle of the HA tag or the GADD45G coding sequence.

So looking at the sequence, the HA tag is probably before GADD45G. Does the HA tag have a stop codon in it? Let me think. HA is a small peptide, so maybe the coding sequence starts with HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag has a TGA in its coding region, the ribosome would stop early, not expressing the full protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted incorrectly, introducing a TGA codon too early.

Wait, the given sequence is the coding plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand (since it's the coding strand). So when the mRNA is made, the sequence is as given, as the mRNA is complementary to the template (non-coding) strand.

Wait no, wait. The coding strand is the same as mRNA, except T for U. So the plus strand is the coding strand.

So the coding sequence starts with ATG, then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc., and then at some point, AAA TGA.

So the first codon after ATG is TAC (position 4-6: TAC), then CCA (7-9: CCA), TAC (10-12: TAC), GAT (13-15: GAT), GTT (16-18: GTT), and so on.

Wait, let's count the positions to see where the TGA is. The sequence after the start codon is:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC...

So the first few codons are:

1: ATG (start)
2: TAC
3: CCA
4: TAC
5: GAT
6: GTT
7: CCA
8: GAT
9: TAC
10: GCC
11: AAA
12: TGA

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the entire protein would be translated up to that point and then stop. So the HA tag and part of GADD45G would be expressed, but the rest wouldn't be. So the protein won't be full-length, and maybe the Western blot doesn't detect it because it's too small, or the HA tag is not present in the right way.

Wait, but why is the TGA present in the coding sequence? Maybe the HA tag was inserted correctly, but a mutation introduced a TGA.

Wait, the problem says that the plus strand of the construct reads as given. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag was not correctly inserted, leading to a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon. If the sequence has a TGA, which is a stop, then the protein would be truncated.

So the problem is that the construct includes a TGA in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the correct answer would be B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reading frame is wrong. But the start codon is correct, and the sequence continues with proper reading.

Another option is D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, the sequence has TGA as a stop, not UAA. So D is not the case because in the mRNA, the codon would be UAA (if the DNA is TAA) or UAG (if DNA is TAG) or UGA (if DNA is TGA). Wait, wait, the DNA is TGA. So the mRNA would be complementary, so the mRNA has UCA? Wait no, wait. Let me think: DNA is TGA. The mRNA is complementary, so it would be ACA? No, wait, no. Wait, DNA is plus strand 5' ATG ... TGA ..., so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would have U in place of T. So the mRNA would have U G A? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

The DNA's coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U.

So if the DNA coding strand has TGA, the mRNA would have U G A? No, wait. Wait, the DNA is TGA, which is on the coding strand. So the mRNA is synthesized as complementary to the template (non-coding) strand. So the template strand would be complementary to the coding strand. So if the coding strand is TGA, the template would be CAT. So the mRNA would be complementary to the template, so it would be UAC.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The coding strand is the same as mRNA, but with T instead of U. So if the coding strand at a certain position is TGA, the mRNA would have U G A. Because T becomes U. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So in the mRNA, it's UGA, which is a stop codon in
