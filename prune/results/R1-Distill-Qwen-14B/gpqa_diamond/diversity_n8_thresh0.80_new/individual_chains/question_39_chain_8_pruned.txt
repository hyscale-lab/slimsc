Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the problem says.

We have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, hold on. So the wave function is complex, having a real and imaginary part. But I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the wave function must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the probability density must be finite. Also, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

The problem states that when they measured the positions, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. That probably means the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is such that it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function outside this interval must be zero. But the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems to have square roots, so maybe it's valid in a certain range.

Wait, but the given function is the wave function in the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3
