Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. The triplet and quartet suggest some splitting due to neighboring protons.

The triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) probably indicates two sets of three equivalent protons each, maybe like two CH2CH3 groups. Wait, wait, but 6H would be like three CH2 groups or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's two CH3 groups attached to something that causes them to split into a triplet. 

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4Hâ€”quartet means each proton is split into four by neighboring protons. So, maybe a CH2CH2 structure where each CH2 is next to another CH2. Like a -CH2-CH2- group. Quartet would come from coupling with a neighboring group with two protons. Wait, but quartet usually results from two neighboring groups each with two protons. Or wait, for a quartet, the neighboring should have n+1=4, so n=3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, if you have a triplet, that's n+1=3, so n=2. So if a triplet is next to a CH2, then the quartet comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

So putting this together: two signals. 6H as triplet, 4H as quartet. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a diethyl ether? Wait, no, because diethyl ether would have CH2CH3 groups. Wait, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 groups are adjacent. Let me think: diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. The structure would be CH2CH2OCH2CH3. Wait, but each CH2CH3 group would have their own protons. The protons on the CH2 next to O would be split. Let me think about their NMR. The CH2 next to O (like in diethyl ether) would show a quartet because each CH2 is adjacent to
