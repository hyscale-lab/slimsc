Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

So the scenario is that Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as much gas as possible because gas molecules can scatter the electron beam, which reduces image quality. But even with that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. 

Wait, mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter of the molecule, and P is pressure. Or wait, maybe another formula—could it be λ = (1)/(√2 * n * σ), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section? Oh yeah, n is the number of particles per unit volume, so n = P/(k*T) because from the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, so n = P/(k*T) (if R is Boltzmann's constant times Avogadro's number, but I think for mean free path it's better to use the formula involving P, T, and d).

So, the initial mean free path is λ1. But when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 relative to λ1.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The temperature of the sample compartment is the same, so T hasn't changed. The pressure is still the same because the pumps are running, and the vacuum hasn't gotten worse. So why λ2?

Oh, wait a minute. The mean free path is for the gas molecules. But the electron beam is another factor. Wait, do the electrons interact with the gas molecules in a way that affects their movement or the way they collide?

Hmm. Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons themselves are moving through the gas. Electrons have a high velocity but are also charged. Do they cause any changes in the gas? Like, could the electrons ionize the gas molecules, or cause
