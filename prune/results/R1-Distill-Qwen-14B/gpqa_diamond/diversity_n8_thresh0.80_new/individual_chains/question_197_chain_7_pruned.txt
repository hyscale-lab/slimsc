Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, the question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I think that's a reaction that usually leads to the formation of an acid from a nitrile or maybe a substitution reaction. Wait, or is it something else? Oh right, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Or wait, when you have red phosphorus and HI, isn't that the conditions for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Or maybe it's the hydrolysis of an alkyne with HI and red phosphorus to form a diol? Wait, no. Let me think again. Oh, right! When a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can produce an amine or maybe a substitution. Wait, no, I think that's the Stephen reduction. Or wait, the reaction of a nitrile with H2O and HgSO4 is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI might be used in a different context. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction of a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus to form an imidamide or maybe it's a substitution. Wait, no, another thought: I think that when you have a nitrile and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis reaction that converts the nitrile to an amine iodide, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an ester or something else.

Wait, let me first try to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks in the 3400-2500 cm⁻¹ region, which is a broad region. That might suggest O-H stretch, but looking at the options, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So
