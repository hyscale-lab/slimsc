Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

The problem says that the state vector |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. So first, I probably need to find the exact state vector by normalizing it since it's given as proportional.

Wait, the question is about measuring the probability of the particle being in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, matrix representation... I should probably write down what that matrix looks like.

The spin space here is two-dimensional because it's dealing with spin-1/2 particles. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let's see: for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, right? So A12 and A21 would be ħ/2, and the diagonals A11 and A22 would be 0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Wait, that's correct because if i≠j, then Aij is ħ/2. So this is the matrix for the operator A.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator A would be the states where A acts by multiplying with an eigenvalue. To find the eigenstates, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

So, let's find the eigenvalues. The matrix is:
[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0. So,

| -λ      ħ/2      |
| ħ/2     -λ      |   = 0

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0 → λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found, but maybe I don't need them right now. Or wait, perhaps I do, because the question is about measuring the state in the eigenbasis of A. So the state |alpha> will be expressed in terms of these eigenstates, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in those states.

But wait, let me think. The operator A is given, and its eigenstates are the states |a+> and |a->, where a+ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and a- the other. So the initial state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but we need to express it in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me write down the state |alpha>.

First, the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the exact state, I need to normalize it. The normalization factor is the
