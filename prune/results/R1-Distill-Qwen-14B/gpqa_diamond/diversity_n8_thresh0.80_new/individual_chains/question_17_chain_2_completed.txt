Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex here is the Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K, is given. I think K is the formation constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex.

Wait, the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K value is very large (5e10), which means the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So under these conditions, most of the Ca²+ and EDTA are tied up in the complex.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in solution.

Because the complex dissociates in solution, but since K is so large, I expect that the dissociation is minimal. So the free [Ca²+] should be very low.

Let me think about the formula. The formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand, so in solution, it can exist in different protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form, so I don't have to worry about the different species. So I can treat EDTA as EDTA^4-.

But wait, in reality, EDTA can have various protonation states, but under the right pH (usually around 10 for EDTA to be in Y^4- form), but the question says pH is ideal, so I can proceed assuming that [EDTA^4-] is the same as the total EDTA concentration in solution? Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, no. Because the complex is Ca-EDTA, the EDTA is bound, so the free [EDTA] is much lower than the concentration of the complex.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total EDTA in solution would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. But given that K is very large, the majority of EDTA is in the complex. So the free EDTA [Y^4-] would be very low.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, right? So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, it forms Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for each complex that dissociates, we get one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x²

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10

x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14

So x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, K = 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = 0.02/(x^2)

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13).

Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7? Because 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-6 is 1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So that's the [Ca²+] in solution.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this value. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the math. Let me re-calculate K:

K = 5e10 = (0.02)/(x^2)

x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Since the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is initially 0.02 M and dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
