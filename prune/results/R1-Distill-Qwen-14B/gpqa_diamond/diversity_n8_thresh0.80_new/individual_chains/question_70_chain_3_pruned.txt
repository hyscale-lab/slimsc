Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking and what information I have to go on.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I'll start by breaking down each reaction and see if I can figure out what each compound might be. Let's go through each part one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is bright red. The mole ratio is 1 A to 8 Bs. Not sure what that could be yet. Maybe A is something like a metal oxide or perhaps a sulfide? Bright red suggests maybe a transition metal compound. I'm thinking of something like copper(II) oxide reacting with something. Wait, but copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's not copper. What else is bright red? Oh! I remember that Pb3O4 is an example, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe sulfur is involved? Sulfur is bright yellow, though. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is about nitrate formation. For example, if A is ammonium nitrate? No, that's not a solid reacting with gas. Wait, maybe it's a metal reacting with a gas to form a metal oxide. For example, maybe A is a metal, B is oxygen gas. But then, the product would be a metal oxide. Hmm. Bright red—maybe it's Iron(III) oxide? No, that's reddish-black. Wait, another possibility: maybe sulfides reacting. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move to the next reaction and see if that helps.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is the product. So C plus D gives E. Hmm. And D is a gas. So C is reacting with another gas to form E. What's extremely hazardous? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like chlorine gas? Or maybe something like phosgene? No, but in that case, D would have
