Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Okay, the problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet suggests two neighboring Hs, and a quartet would mean three neighboring Hs.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So Compound A has a total of 10 hydrogens? Or maybe 10 in certain groups. Let me think about common structures. Triplet and quartet in NMR often come from adjacent CH2 groups. Like, maybe a (CH2)2 group next to another (CH2)3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Let me think about the typical coupling patterns.

A triplet (multiplet with two neighbors) at 0.9 ppm. 0.9 ppm is usually a CH3 group attached to something, like maybe a CH2. So, triplet for a CH3 next to a CH2. Then a quartet for a CH2 next to a CH3 and maybe another CH2. Wait, or maybe it's a (CH2)2 group. Let me think, perhaps a structure like (CH2CH3)2CH or something similar. Wait, no, maybe it's a diethyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: looking for common compounds with two signals in NMR. Diethyl ether? No, that would have more signals. Maybe something like neopentane, but that's 2,2-dimethylpropane, but its NMR would have a singlet for the central CH2 and maybe something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, think about the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's two equivalent CH3 groups. Each with three Hs, so 3*2=6. So perhaps two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H suggests two CH2 groups. So maybe a structure where two CH3 are attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, another thought: the quartet (which integrates to 4H) could be a CH2CH2 group. But wait, no, quartet implies splitting from three neighboring Hs. So how does that happen? Maybe a CH2 next to a CH3, which is next to another CH2. So like CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a propyl group. Or perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm: CH3 groups with two neighboring Hs. So each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm: a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 (which would split into a quartet because the CH2 has two Hs, and the adjacent CH3 has three Hs, so 2 + 1 = 3 neighbors, making a quartet? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of peaks in a multiplet is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So a quartet implies 3 neighboring Hs. So, if a CH2 group is next to a CH3, which has three Hs, then the CH2 would be a quartet.

So putting it together: two CH3 groups (each as triplet) attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that's pentane, but that would have more Hs. Wait, let me count. (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3 would have more Hs, but in the NMR, the triplet and quartet are for 6H and
