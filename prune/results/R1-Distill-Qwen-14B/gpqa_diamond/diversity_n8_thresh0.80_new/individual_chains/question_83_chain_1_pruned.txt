Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, maybe I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base. So this is a titration between a weak acid and a strong base. The equivalence point will be where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me think about the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration should be half of the original because the volume doubles. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = M1 * (V1/V2). So V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40, so M2 is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So first, I'll find the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, volume is 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0
