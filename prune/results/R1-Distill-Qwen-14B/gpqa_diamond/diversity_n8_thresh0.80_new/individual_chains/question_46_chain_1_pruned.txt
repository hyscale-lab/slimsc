Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, let's see what I remember about Grubbs catalyst. Oh right, it's used for alkene metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkyl groups between alkenes, typically breaking and reforming the double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe it's actually achiral? Let me think. 3-methylpent-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene: five carbons, double bond starting at C1. So it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So 1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Wait, pent means five carbons in a chain. So 1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but wait, that's six carbons actually. Because the main chain is five, but with a methyl on C3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait that's six carbons. No, wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For pent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? So adding a methyl group on carbon 3 (the third carbon from the start) would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's six carbons because CH2=CH-CH(CH3) is part of a five-carbon chain? No, wait, the main chain is five carbons, but the substituent is on third carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. Let's number from the double bond. So 1 and 2 are the double bond. So, position 3 is the next carbon. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's actually five carbons: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-), 5 (CH3). So that's correct.

Now, racemic mix means both enantiomers are present. But wait, is this molecule chiral? For a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center. So, looking at the molecule, the carbon at position 3 is connected to four different groups. Let's see: in CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the central carbon (C3) is connected to:

- CH2=CH-CH (from the left)
-
