Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they visualize the mice under the confocal microscope. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the setup. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so it's expressing two proteins from a single transcript. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutively active. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated after the ligand. 

Now, between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. So without Cre, the stop signals prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and tested expression with Western blot. They see signals proportional to actin loading, so the proteins are being expressed. So the construct seems to be working in vitro.

Now, the mice are homozygous for this construct in a wildtype background. They crossed them to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and the Cre would be active in SOX10-expressing cells. So the idea is that in the offspring, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in neural crest cells, leading to expression of mCherry (from ligand) and eGFP (from receptor) in those cells.

But when they looked, there was no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So they act on different cells. But this doesn't explain why the GFP isn't expressed. The construct's expression is what matters, not whether the ligand-receptor interaction is local or distant.

Option B: receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't be expressed on the surface, so maybe no fluorescence. But in the Western blot, they should see the protein, but maybe not membrane-bound. But the question says the Western blot worked, so the protein is expressed. But the GFP is a tag—so if it's in the Golgi, maybe it's not properly folded or not fluorescent. Hmm, possible but not the first thing I think of.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor has an IRES, so it's dependent on the CBA promoter as well. If the enhancer is missing, expression would be low. But the Western blot showed expression, so perhaps the promoter is working. Unless the enhancer is necessary for the promoter's function. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. If the promoter works without an enhancer, maybe this isn't the issue.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh wait, if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be properly expressed. So when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor and eGFP are joined. If the reading frame is off, the eGFP won't be correctly produced. So the Western blot might show the receptor, but not eGFP. Alternatively, maybe the fusion protein is messed up. But the question says they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe they could detect the receptor, but not eGFP.

Wait, the vector is designed so that when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed with eGFP at the C-terminus. If the stop is in frame, then the receptor would be in frame with eGFP. If the stop is out of frame, the eGFP might not be correctly added. So perhaps the construct has a frame shift between the receptor and eGFP.

Alternatively, maybe the way the vector was designed, the IRES is before the receptor, but perhaps the frame is such that after the IRES, the receptor is correctly in frame with the eGFP.

Wait, the vector is set up as ligand (CBA promoter) - then stop with loxP. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no. The bicistronic vector would have the first gene (ligand) under the CBA promoter, then an IRES, then the second gene (receptor). But in this case, they've inserted stop cassettes. Wait, the setup is: ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with a stop before eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the case where the vector is designed to have the receptor's ORF in frame with eGFP. If during the cloning, the frame was incorrect, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. That could lead to no fluorescence.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were not correctly excised, but the problem states that the mice were homozygous for the construct, indicating that Cre has acted. Also, they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre in the right cells.

Wait, but the construct is in a loxP and lox2272 setup. LoxP is a 34 bp sequence, and lox2272 is a variant that can be used for conditional recombination. So the idea is that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of the downstream reporter.

But if the loxP and lox2272 are arranged correctly. So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 is in a different orientation. Or perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are in such a way that when Cre is expressed, the stops are removed, allowing expression.

So for the receptor-eGFP, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is correctly excised, then the receptor is expressed with eGFP. If the lox2272 is not correctly recognized, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the Western blot after transfection showed expression, so the stop must have been excised in the transient system. But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the right cells, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, so in neural crest cells, which express SOX10, Cre should be active.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't excised in the mouse, but that doesn't explain why the Western blot worked.

Wait, another angle. The vector is a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. So when Cre is present, both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed, but in the same cells.

But the question is about why eGFP isn't observed. So maybe the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't being made correctly.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. So the reading frame after the stop cassette removal is incorrect, leading to a frame shift and a nonfunctional eGFP. So the protein would be made, but eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

In that case, when you do Western blot, you might detect the receptor (since the ligand is under a separate construct) but not the eGFP. Or perhaps the Western blot detects the eGFP, but if the frame is wrong, it might not be expressed.

Wait, the antibodies are raised against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP is not correctly expressed, the antibody might not detect it. But the question says that the Western blot worked—so the proteins were expressed. So maybe the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent because it's not correctly folded, perhaps due to a frame shift. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't made at all.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette wasn't properly excised. But the presence of Cre would have done that. Unless the Cre wasn't active in the cells.

But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre line that's active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active in those cells, excising the stop cassettes.

Wait, another possibility: the vector is designed so that the loxP and lox2272 are in such a way that only one of them is excised. But I'm not sure about the specifics of loxP and lox2272 usage.

But perhaps the lox2272 isn't being recognized by the Cre, so the stop remains. But lox2272 is a variant of loxP that is designed to be recombined by Cre as well. So it should work.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly inserted. So the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor.

So the vector has the receptor gene, then a stop cassette, then eGFP. When the stop is removed, the receptor is directly followed by eGFP. If the cloning wasn't done correctly, the reading frame after the stop would be wrong, leading to a frame shift. So the eGFP would not be correctly inserted, and thus not fluoresce.

So let's think: if the receptor ORF ends with a stop, and then the eGFP starts, but the stop is in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon is in frame. Wait, no, because when the stop cassette is removed, the stop is gone. So the receptor is in frame with eGFP.

Wait, but the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So normally, the receptor would end, then a stop, then eGFP. But when Cre removes the stop, the receptor is directly followed by eGFP, so it's a fusion protein.

But if the reading frame after the receptor is not the same as the start of eGFP, then the frame would shift, leading to a premature stop or no production of eGFP.

So if the vector was created without ensuring that the receptor's stop is in frame with eGFP's start, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly.

So that would align with option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Therefore, when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.


The question involves understanding why no green signal (eGFP) is observed in a mouse model expressing a bicistronic construct. The construct includes a ligand under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and a receptor under the control of an IRES element, fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. Cre recombination is expected to excise these stops, allowing expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. The mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells, excising the stops and enabling eGFP expression. However, no green signal was observed.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** The ligand and receptor being in a paracrine relationship does not explain the absence of eGFP expression. The issue lies in the construct's expression, not the ligand-receptor interaction.
- **Option B:** If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP might not fluoresce. However, the Western blot confirmed protein expression, suggesting the issue is not related to trafficking.
- **Option C:** The absence of an enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is unlikely because the CBA promoter is constitutively active and sufficient for expression, as confirmed by the Western blot.
- **Option D:** If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. This could result in no fluorescence even if the receptor is expressed. This explanation aligns with the observation of no green signal, as the frame shift would prevent proper eGFP expression.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, leading to improper eGFP expression and no green signal.
