Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame? And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So I think I need to apply some sort of velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

Right, because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? No, wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion. Or does it not?

Wait, no, according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same in all inertial frames. But in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. So if the glass is moving, and the light is traveling through it, how does the glass's velocity v affect the observed speed of the light.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving towards us as well.

Wait, no, the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass. Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So, for someone in the lab, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, but the beam is probably moving towards the observer because the glass is moving towards the observer. I'm a bit confused about the direction here.

Let me rephrase the scenario: imagine the glass is a block moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light beam is inside this glass, moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is going through the glass which is moving towards us. So from the lab frame, we're seeing the light beam moving towards us as well.

Wait, but light speed in the glass is slower than c. So normally, if the glass is stationary, light speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So I think the formula for adding velocities is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²), but that's for when u is the velocity of an object in one frame, and we want to find it in another frame moving at speed v. But in this case, the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n, and perhaps we need to transform that to the lab frame.

Wait, no. Let me think about it again. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n towards the observer. The glass itself is moving at speed v towards the observer in the lab frame.
