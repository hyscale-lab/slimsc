Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from a combination of rings and double bonds. Five is a lot, maybe one ring and some double bonds or something like that.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at the peaks:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group or something.

Then 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because doublet implies each proton is next to one other. So two protons in a doubletâ€”like in a para-substituted benzene, perhaps each H is next to two others, but maybe in a di-substituted ring.

6.51 ppm, another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Maybe another set of protons in a similar situation. Maybe a di-substituted benzene ring adjacent to the first one.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but singlet? Wait, but it's 2H. Could they be adjacent to each other, like in a vinyl group or something else. Or maybe they're part of an aromatic ring that's substituted in a way that the protons are not split much. Alternatively, maybe they're part of an enol or something.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's around the region for CH2 groups. The doublet suggests adjacent to another CH2 or maybe some other coupling. Maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or perhaps adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Putting this together: the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm is probably a terminal aldehyde, maybe part of a conjugated system. The two sets of aromatic protons (6.98 and 6.51) might suggest two different aromatic rings attached to the compound. The 6.27 ppm could be two protons on a conjugated double bond, perhaps in a butenone or something like that.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound with some substituents. For example, two benzene rings connected to a chain.

Looking at the NMR again. The aldehyde is 1H, which would be the end of a chain. The CH2 at 3.66 could be connected to the aldehyde. So maybe there's a structure
