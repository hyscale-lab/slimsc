Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, uncertainty in P_z, right. So I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say that <P_z> is zero or something. I need to calculate the expectation values using the given state.

First, let me write down the given matrices.

P_x matrix:
First row: [0, ħ/√2, 0]
Second row: [ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2]
Third row: [0, ħ/√2, 0]

P_y:
First row: [0, -iħ/√2, 0]
Second row: [iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2]
Third row: [0, iħ/√2, 0]

P_z:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but wait: in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is given by <ψ| P_z |ψ>. So I need to compute that.

But wait, let me make sure. So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So to compute <P_z>, I do ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, <P_z²> is ψ† P_z² ψ.

So let me first compute <P_z>.

Calculating <P_z>:

The matrix P_z is diagonal, so it's easier. Each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for that basis state.

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state ψ is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

So for instance, the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude of the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ. The second component is 1/√2, which is the amplitude of the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0. The third component is -1/2, amplitude of eigenvalue -ħ.

So the expectation value of P_z is sum [ |a_i|^2 * p_i ], where a_i are the coefficients and p_i the corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, that's right. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the eigenvalues.

So let's compute each |a_i|^2.

a1 = -1/2 → |a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

a2 = 1/√2 → |a2|^2 = 1/2.

a3 = -1/2 → |a3|^2 = 1/4.

Now, the eigenvalues for each state:

First state (a1): ħ.

Second state (a2): 0.

Third state (a3): -ħ.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0.

Hmm, so the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about <P_z²>?

Since each eigenvalue for P_z is squared. So the eigenvalues for P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2=0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So <P_z²> = (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = [ (1/4 + 1/4) ] ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The formula is ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² ), right? So in this case, since <P_z> is zero, it's sqrt( <P_z²> ), which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think another way. Suppose I don't use the eigenbasis approach and instead compute <P_z> and <P_z²> manually using matrix multiplication.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Compute <P_z> = ψ† P_z ψ.

P_z is diagonal, so when we apply P_z to ψ, we just multiply each component by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So P_z ψ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ħ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which, since all elements are real, is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ψ† P_z ψ is the dot product of ψ† and P_z ψ:

[-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2] · [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Calculating each term:

-1/2 * (-ħ/2 ) = (ħ/4)
1/√2 * 0 = 0
-1/2 * ( ħ/2 ) = - ħ/4.

Adding these: (ħ/4) + 0 + (- ħ/4) ) = 0. So yes, same result.

Now <P_z²> = ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

P_z squared is the same as P_z multiplied by P_z, so the diagonal entries are squared.

So P_z^2 is:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
 0, 0, 0;
 0, 0, ħ² ]

So applying P_z^2 to ψ:

[ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ) ]^T → [ - ħ²/2, 0, - ħ²/2 ]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because for each component i, (P_z^2 ψ)_i = P_z^2_ii ψ_i. So the first component is (ħ)^2 * (-1/2), the second is 0^2 * (1/√2) = 0, third component is (-ħ)^2 * (-1/2) = ħ² * (-1/2).

Wait, no, wait: (-ħ)^2 is ħ², so third component is ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

So P_z^2 ψ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Dot product with [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Compute each term:

(-1/2) * (- ħ²/2 ) = (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

1/√2 * 0 = 0.

(-1/2) * (- ħ²/2 ) = (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2. So same as before.

Thus, uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ), which matches option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation values can be computed directly using the probabilities $|a_i|^2$ (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$) and the corresponding eigenvalues.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The probabilities are:
- $|a_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$ (for the eigenvalue $\hbar$),
- $|a_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$ (for the eigenvalue $0$),
- $|a_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$ (for the eigenvalue $-\hbar$).

The expectation value of $P_z$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
