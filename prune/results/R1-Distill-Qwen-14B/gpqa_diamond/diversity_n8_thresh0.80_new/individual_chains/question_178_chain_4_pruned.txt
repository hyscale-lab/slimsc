Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu], which I remember are the commutators of the gamma matrices. Right, those appear in the definition of the spinor representation of the Lorentz group.

So the question is asking two things: what's the mass dimension of κ, and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each with a dimension and a yes/no on renormalization.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime because the action is dimensionless and you integrate over d^4 x (mass dimension -4). So all terms in L must have dimension 4.

So let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I remember that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac equation has terms like γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must match dimensions. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so the term ∂ψ must have dimension 4 (since the action is integrated over d^4x, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). So ∂ψ has dimension 4, which implies ψ has dimension 3/2, because [∂ψ] = [∂][ψ] = 1 + [ψ] =4 → [ψ]=3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. The term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is part of the kinetic term. So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, because it's the adjoint. So each ψ is dimension 3/2, because (3/2) + (3/2) + [γ matrices are dimensionless] + [∂, which is 1] → 3/2 *2 +1 =4. So yeah, ψ is 3/2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ has the same dimension as [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is zero because it's a commutator of dimensionless terms. So σ is dimensionless.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, so F is derived from the potential A, which is a gauge field. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + something with the fields maybe. Wait, the Maxwell tensor is F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential which has dimension 1. So F has dimension [∂][A] →
