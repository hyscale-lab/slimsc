Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts? Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l (something with Legendre polynomials), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up a bit. Oh wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Or wait, no, more specifically, the imaginary part at specific angles is linked to the phase shifts.

Wait, the problem says to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That would be θ = 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam is coming in along, say, the z-axis, so scattering at 0 degrees means the particle goes straight through. But wait, no, wait: when θ=0, it's the same direction as the incident beam. But in scattering, θ=0 would be the direction of the incoming particle, but in scattering, maybe the forward direction is θ=0, and the backward is π.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is something like Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think Im(f) is given by (k/(2π)) times the sum over all l of (2l+1) sin δ_l, but only for the l-th partial wave. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l for each l. 

Wait, the problem gives me all the δ_l's. Let me look at the problem statement again. The phase shifts given are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. The rest are ignored. So I have l from 0 to 4.

The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (forward direction) is Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * Σ (2l + 1) sin δ_l.

Wait, why? Because each partial wave contributes to the amplitude, and at θ=0, the spherical harmonics simplify, and the sum becomes that. So the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by k/(2π).

But wait, the scattering amplitude f is a function of the momentum transfer, q. I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is given by [k/(2π)] times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l for all contributing l.

So, the problem is looking for the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum_{l} (2l+
