Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which I guess means their masses are equal. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations because eccentricity doesn't come into play. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But since both stars have the same radius, that might affect the probability of transit differently.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting in front of its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to their orbital distances. Wait, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the probability is actually higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, which is a geometric probability.

The formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, I think the exact probability also depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, assuming R_planet is much smaller than R_star, which it is for Earth-like planets. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a), because R_planet << R_star.

Wait, no, let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk (which a planet must cross) to the area of the sky. But actually, the probability is P = (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p / R_* ))^2, but since R_p << R_*, (R_p/R_*) is negligible, so it's approximately P
