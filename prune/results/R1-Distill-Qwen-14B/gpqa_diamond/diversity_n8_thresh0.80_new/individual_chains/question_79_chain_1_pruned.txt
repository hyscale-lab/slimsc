Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these things. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which undergoes a reaction. The product's NMR data is given, and I have to figure out which option it is among A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. But wait, wait. Oh, right, I think it's more about acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but maybe in this case, it's a different scenario. Or perhaps it's used as a catalyst for some kind of rearrangement? Hmm, not so sure. Maybe I should focus on the NMR data of the product.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet with three hydrogens. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal much. Maybe a CH3 connected to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring, or perhaps part of an epoxide?

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same as above. So two different methyl groups? Or maybe one methyl and another group with equivalent hydrogens? Wait, same shift but in two separate signals? So two distinct methyl groups.

Then the aromatic region:

- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. Maybe adjacent to another proton in a coupling pattern. Like in a vinyl group or a substituted benzene.

- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. That's common in para-substituted aromatic rings. So maybe two protons that are equivalent, like on opposite sides of a benzene ring.

- δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): Another set of doublets. The 1H as a doublet suggests it's coupling with one proton, so perhaps part of a substitution pattern where it's adjacent to another proton. The 2H could be another para-substituted group or maybe a meta arrangement.

In the 13C NMR:

- δ 21.3 (s, 1C) and 28.4 (s, 1C): These are both quaternary or CH3 groups. The 21.3 is probably a methyl attached to something deshielded, like maybe a carbonyl or an electronegative atom. The 28.4 could be another methyl, maybe part of an isopropyl group or another substituent.

- The rest are in the aromatic region. Let's see: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), and 197.7 (1C, s). Wait, 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon. So maybe a ketone or an ester or an acid. But in the product, considering the reaction conditions, perhaps it's an epoxide.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! That's commonly used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxides. Or wait, maybe it's used as a base in an elimination reaction? Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The Sharpless epoxidation uses a titanium-based catalyst, but maybe this is a different setup. Oh, wait, no—another possibility: The compound X is an epoxide, and upon reaction, perhaps it opens? Or maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide to form another structure. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is some kind of acid-catalyzed rearr
