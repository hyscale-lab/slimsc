Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Wait, I remember that the triplet and quartet are about splitting from neighboring protons. Also, 0.9 ppm is usually a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or another CH group. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests maybe a CH2 next to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted something. Oh, wait, if it's a triplet and quartet, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkane. Like maybe a diethyl group. Because ethyl groups have that kind of splitting. Let me think: for diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet (because each is next to a CH2), and the CH2 would be a quartet. But wait, in diethyl ether, each end would look like that. But in this case, the NMR of compound A is showing two signals. So maybe it's a diethyl group attached to another structure.

Alternatively, could it be a cyclopropane or something else? Hmm. Another thought: maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else, like a benzene ring? No, wait, the integration is 6H and 4H. So 6H is possibly two CH3 groups, each with 3H. 4H would be two CH2 groups, each with 2H. So perhaps it's connected like CH2CH2CH3. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group. Wait, but a 1.3 ppm quartet could be a CH2 next to another CH2.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 6H at 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so that's probably two equivalent CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. So each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two neighboring H's, hence a triplet. Then, the CH2 would be next to another CH2. So maybe it's a structure like CH2CH2-C... Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative with two ethyl groups attached in such a way that
