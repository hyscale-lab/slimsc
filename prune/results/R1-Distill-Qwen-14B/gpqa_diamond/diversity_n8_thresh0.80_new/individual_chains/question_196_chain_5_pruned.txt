Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when the potential energy is fully converted into kinetic energy. So, the maximum velocity v_max is when all the potential energy is kinetic. The formula I remember is (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). Wait, that's option C. But wait, the question says it's relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formula. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

In relativity, momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential; it's the total relativistic energy.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)mv_max² + (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma - 1)mc², and the potential is (1/2)kx². So maybe I need to set up an equation where the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A).

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, velocity is max, and all energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So perhaps the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy at maximum displacement and the rest mass energy. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the total energy. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is the potential energy plus the rest energy. Then, when the mass is at equilibrium (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so total energy E would be (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy, which is mc². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then at the equilibrium point, the kinetic energy is E - mc²? Because when x=0, the potential is zero, so kinetic energy is E - mc². Wait, but that would be (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma -1)mc². So, we have the total energy E = gamma mc². So when the mass is moving at maximum speed, all the energy is relativistic kinetic plus rest energy.

Wait, let me correct that. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential plus rest. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc². At the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc². So setting them equal: (gamma) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, so gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc². Subtract mc² from both sides: (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2) kA².

But I'm trying to find v_max. So let's write gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me rearrange this equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, because (gamma-1) mc² = (1/2) kA² → gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 mc²) → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So
