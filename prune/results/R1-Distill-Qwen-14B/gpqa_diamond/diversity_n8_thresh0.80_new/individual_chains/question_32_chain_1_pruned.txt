Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question must be a heavy one. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, I need to find the energy of the collider. I think this relates to relativistic energy. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = γ * m₀c².

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which would typically be the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? I'm a bit confused. Oh, RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, sometimes they refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify which one is being asked here.

Wait, the problem states, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think they're referring to the kinetic energy. Or maybe not? Because sometimes the energy given in colliders is the total energy, or sometimes the kinetic. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The total energy E = gamma * m_rest * c². The kinetic energy K is E - m_rest c² = (gamma - 1) m_rest c².

So which one is the energy given in the options? The problem says "the energy of RHIC", which I think is usually the kinetic energy. Because RHIC's energy is often cited as the kinetic energy per ion. So I'll proceed assuming that K is the energy we need to find.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the total energy. Because sometimes when people say the energy of the collider, they mean the total energy. Oh, but in the problem statement, it's written as "the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". Hmm, maybe the energy here refers to the kinetic energy. Because the speed is a function of kinetic energy, not total energy. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is a function of gamma, which is part of the total energy.

Wait, velocity is determined by gamma. Let me think about how velocity and gamma are related. The velocity v is related to gamma by the equation:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall the correct formula. The relation between v and gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if v is 0.96c, then I can compute gamma.

Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c.

v = 0.96c.

First, compute beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1
