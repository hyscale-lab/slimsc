Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: there's a ligand and a receptor. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. They are in neural crest cells, and the question is about their developmental fate.

The experiment involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element, which I think is a way to allow internal ribosome entry, so that the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein from the same mRNA.

There are stop cassettes between the ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop-loxP) and between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272). I recall that these stop cassettes prevent the fusion proteins from being made unless the loxP sites are recombined, like with Cre.

So the setup is probably using Cre to excise the stop cassettes. The idea is that when Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette. So the ligand should be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. But wait, in the vector, the ligand is first, then a stop, then the receptor and another stop. So if Cre is active, it would delete both stops, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins to be expressed.

They made mouse models homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so I guess the Cre is under SOX10's control, meaning it's expressed where SOX10 is active, like in the neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal using the fluorescent markers. They're expecting green (eGFP) but didn't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the experiment, they're expressing both in the same cells (neural crest), so maybe they're autocrine. But how does that affect the expression of GFP? I'm not sure. If the ligand is secreted and acts on the same cells, maybe the construct isn't working because the ligand isn't secreted? Not sure how this would prevent eGFP expression.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would the construct be stuck? Maybe a stop signal or misfolding. But the question is why after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. Or maybe the problem is with the construct design, not the trafficking.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so unless the promoter isn't active, which would affect both. But if both were not expressed, maybe other markers would show issues. But in the Western blot, they tested the construct expression. The total proteins give a signal proportional to actin, meaning the loading is fine. So if the proteins aren't expressed, the Western would show no bands for the ligand or receptor. But the question says after transfection, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Maybe the Western showed expression? If SOX10-Cre is active, the stops are removed, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed. But if the enhancer was missing, perhaps the promoters aren't working. Hmm.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh wait, the vector's receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, and Cre doesn't properly remove it, the eGFP won't be expressed. Or, if the stop is still present, the receptor won't be expressed. Wait, the question says the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So if Cre is used, it should remove that stop. But wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272, which are different sites. Do they flank
