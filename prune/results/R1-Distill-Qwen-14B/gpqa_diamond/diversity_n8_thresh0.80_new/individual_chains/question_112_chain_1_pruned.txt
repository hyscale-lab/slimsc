Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I guess I need to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, states need to be normalized, right? So the sum of the probabilities should be 1.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like?

Let me think. For a two-level system, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, corresponding to |up> and |down>. So the matrix A would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements (where i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal (iâ‰ j) are hbar/2.

Wait, but that operator looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * X. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of X, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. But I'm not sure if that's important yet.

So the problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in these eigenstates. But wait, the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So first, I might need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the given operator (which is the x-basis), or maybe find the projection onto that basis.

Wait, no. The operator's eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, so I can find their expressions in the z-basis. Let me write down the eigenstates of A.

The eigenvalues of A would be the same as those of sigma_x scaled by hbar/2. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for A, they're (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, because A is a multiple of sigma_x.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to find the overlap between |alpha> and each of these eigenstates.

But wait, first, I need to normalize |alpha> because the question says it's proportional to that vector. So let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm is the inner product <alpha|alpha>.

So let's calculate that:

|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Compute each term: |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

|2 -i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5), squared is 5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the norm squared is 7, which means the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of the operator A are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring +hbar/
