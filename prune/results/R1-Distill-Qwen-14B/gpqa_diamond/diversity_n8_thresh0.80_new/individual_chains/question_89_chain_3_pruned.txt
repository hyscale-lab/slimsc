Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with an NMR analysis of product 3. 

First, let's break down each step. The initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When it's heated with excess KOH, it likely undergoes an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of an elimination product, probably an alkene. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. Wait, no, wait—1720 is more in line with a carbonyl, but elimination would form an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, KOH can also cause dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene (like an E2 mechanism). But the IR peak—maybe that's from an adjacent carbonyl group? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I don't think so. Wait, no, the product after KOH is 1, so let me think about the possible product.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would likely remove both Br atoms. Because adamantane is a diamondoid structure, removing two adjacent Brs would lead to a ring-opening? Or maybe form a diene? No, wait, elimination reactions typically form double bonds. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Hmm, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide. So when KOH is used, it would eliminate HBr from each Br, forming a double bond. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C3? Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure, so the positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Oh, wait, maybe. But regardless, elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. 1720 is more typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, or aldehyde. So maybe after elimination, the product isn
