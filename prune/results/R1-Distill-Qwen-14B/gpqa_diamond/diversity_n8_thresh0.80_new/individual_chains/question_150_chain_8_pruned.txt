Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents. I'm supposed to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let me look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR data points are:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, let's break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That high up usually suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show strong deshielding, so that's probably a -CHO group.

Next, the aromatic region. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions are doublets each integrating for 2H. That might suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring because doublets in aromatic regions often indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with a substituent in the para position.

Then, the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlets can sometimes be indicative of protons that are exchanging, like those attached to an oxygen (like -OH groups) but in this case, it's 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group, like a CH2 connected to something else, but in a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's around where OCH2 groups show up. Methine (CH) or methylene (CH2) groups attached to electronegative atoms like oxygen usually resonate in that region. So perhaps an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, a para-substituted benzene ring, an OCH2 group, and another aromatic ring or some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (X=0). So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -10 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5. Hmm, that's not possible because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, correct formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here because there's no halogen. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean five rings and double bonds. Let's think: each ring or double bond is one degree, a triple bond is two, etc.

Five degrees could be: one ring (like a benzene ring, which is three degrees because it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), another ring (like a five-membered ring with one double bond, but wait, a benzene ring is already three, so another ring would add another, so four, and then another double bond for fifth. Alternatively, maybe two benzene rings? No, because each benzene ring is three degrees. So maybe the molecule has a benzene ring and another double bond or ring.

Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (1), and a ring (1) would make 5. Or perhaps a benzene ring (3) and two double bonds (2), which adds up to 5. Let's see.

Looking back at the NMR data, the aldehyde is one functional group. Then the aromatic protons suggest two separate rings, perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings? Or maybe the aromatic protons are from a single ring but with substituents.

Wait, the two doublets in the aromatic region (6.98 and 6.51 ppm) each for 2H. That suggests maybe two separate aromatic rings, each with a substituent. Because a doublet for 2H would be in a para-substituted ring, where the two equivalent protons are next to each other.

So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, each bearing a substituent. One substituent is an aldehyde group, another is something else.

Wait, but the aldehyde is only one proton, so that's one substituent. The other
