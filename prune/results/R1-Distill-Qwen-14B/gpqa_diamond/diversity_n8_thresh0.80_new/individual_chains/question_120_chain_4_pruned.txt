Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, right! The parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density is constant in space. Wait, number density, so like, same number per cubic parsec everywhere. So, the number of stars in a volume depends on how much volume is between two parallaxes.

But wait, parallax isn't a linear measure. Let me think about how the volume relates to parallax. If I consider stars at a certain distance, their parallax is plx, and the distance is d = 1/plx. So if I'm looking at a thin shell between d and d+dd, what's the volume of that shell?

Oh right, the volume element in spherical shells is 4πd² dd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and if I multiply by the thickness dd, that's the volume. So, for a small change in distance dd, the volume is proportional to d squared times dd.

But since we're interested in parallax, let's express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Therefore, the volume element in terms of plx would be: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But how does dd relate to a change in plx, d plx?

Since plx is 1/d, the derivative d plx/d d = d/d d (1/d) = -1/d². So, d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, so solving for dd, we get dd = -d² d plx. But since plx is positive, maybe I should consider the absolute value or just the magnitude. So, dd = (1/(plx^2)) d plx, because d=1/plx. So substituting d = 1/plx, dd = (1/( (1/plx)^2 )) d plx → dd = plx² d plx.

So putting it all together, the volume element in terms of plx is:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (plx² d plx) )

Wait, let me compute that: 4π (1/plx²) * (plx² d plx) ) → 4π d plx.

Oh, interesting! So the volume element in terms of plx is proportional to d plx. That's a big simplification.

So the number of stars in a given volume would be proportional to the volume. Since the number density is constant (let's say n stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV.

In this case, dV is proportional to d plx, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to n * 4π d plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, more precisely, the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx would be n * 4π (1/plx²) * (dd). But wait, earlier I found that Volume is 4π d plx. So the number of stars is n * 4π d plx.

Wait, but why? Because the volume element in terms of plx is 4π d plx. So the number of stars is n multiplied by that.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to d plx, which is a constant times d plx. That would imply that the number of stars in each slice of plx is the same? But that can't be right because stars get farther away, but if the distribution is uniform in space, more distant regions would have more volume, but wait, no, in this case, the volume element is 4π d plx, so a unit change in plx (like d plx=1) would give a fixed number of stars, regardless of plx.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin slice of plx between plx and plx + d plx. The volume is 4π d plx, so number of stars is n *4π d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n *4π, which is a constant. So the number of stars per unit plx doesn't depend on plx at all. So the number is constant as plx changes.

But wait, the options don't have a constant. The options are 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait another thought. Maybe I should consider how the number density in plx relates. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the number of stars per unit volume in plx space.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number.

The number of stars per unit volume in space is constant, let's say n.

The volume between parallax plx and plx + d plx is V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx) / (plx^2).

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me go back.

I think I made a mistake earlier in the expression for the volume element.

The volume element in terms of plx is 4π (d)^2 dd. And d = 1/plx, so:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 dd.

But we need to express this in terms of d plx. So, since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

But since d plx is a small positive change, and dd is negative, perhaps we take the absolute value. So, dd = (1/plx^2) d plx.

So, substituting into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Oh! So the volume element is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Then the number of stars in this volume is n * Volume = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (n *4π)
