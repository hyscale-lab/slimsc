Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

So, the state given is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Wait, but since it's proportional, I probably need to normalize it first. Right, because the probabilities have to add up to 1.

First step: Find the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = c[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>], where c is the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, let me compute the inner product. The inner product would be c squared times [(1-i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i)]? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product of (a|up> + b|down>) is a* a + b* b because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So, let's compute a = (1+i), b = (2 -i). Then:

|a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + 1 = 2. 

|b|^2 = (2 -i)(2 + i) = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant c is 1/sqrt(7), because |c|^2 *7 =1. So c=1/sqrt(7).

Okay, so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, because the spin has two states (up and down), the operator A is:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So this matrix represents the operator. Hmm, but wait, what operator is this? Oh, I think this is the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σ_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x would have eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the problem wants the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. That is, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, but the probabilities are squared amplitudes of the state in each eigenstate.

Hmm, so to find the probabilities, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Let's denote |+x> and |−x> as the eigenstates.

So, |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

Once I have a and b, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So, first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

The state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which I have already.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Let me write this as:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Now, express this in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

We can write |alpha> = (a + b)/sqrt(2) |+x> + (a - b)/sqrt(2) |−x>.

Wait, because:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state expressed in terms of |up> and |down> can be written as:

c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>

To find c1 and c2, we can write:

|alpha> = [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |+x> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |−x>

Wait, let me see. Plugging in |+x> and |−x>:

c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) |up> + (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) |down>

Compare with |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>

So:

a = (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2)
b = (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2)

So solving these two equations:

Adding them: a + b = (2 c1)/sqrt(2) => c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2)/2.

Subtracting: a - b = (2 c2)/sqrt(2) => c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, let me compute a + b and a - b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a + b = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / sqrt(7)

a - b = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)

So,

c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2)/2 = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/2 = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly,

c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2)/2 = ( (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) ) * sqrt(2)/2 = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

(3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7))) ) squared 

= (9 * 2) / (4 *7)

= 18 / 28 = 9/1
