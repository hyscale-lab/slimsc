Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, observed in a laboratory frame. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, especially at speeds comparable to the speed of light, things get a bit tricky with relativity and all that. But I'm not too sure about the specifics here.

Alright, so the setup is: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass when it's moving... Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. Normally, when the medium is stationary, the speed v is c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So, for example, glass has a higher n than air, so light slows down.

But this problem adds a layer of motion: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Now, the observer is in the lab, which is presumably the rest frame, so how does the glass's motion affect the speed of light in it?

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Do I need to apply special relativity here? Because if the glass is moving, the observer's frame is different. Wait, but the glass is part of the medium through which the light is propagating. So it's not just a simple case of the medium moving relative to the observer.

Wait, I think I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties and the frame's motion. But the index of refraction n itself might be affected by motion. Oh right! There's something called the relativistic Doppler effect, and also the way refractive indices transform under different reference frames.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it from the perspective of the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, let me think about the speed of light in the moving glass. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be c/n, because that's how it works normally. But when the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would see a different speed.

Wait no, that's not quite
