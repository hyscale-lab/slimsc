Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy needed for a nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, right? In this case, the ion is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. If there are 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6, I think, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

The question is about the energy required to accelerate this nucleus to 0.96 times the speed of light (0.96c). I remember that for relativistic particles, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. Instead, we use the relativistic energy equation.

The total energy E of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate γ first.

Let me write down the given variables:
- v = 0.96c
- So v/c = 0.96.

First, compute γ. Let's calculate 1 - v²/c². v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then take the square root: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So γ = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

So E = γ * m * c². But to get the energy in GeV, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Oh right, because the nucleus has a mass, so I need to find the rest mass of ^6Li.

Wait, the rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Let's see, protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 938 MeV/c². But wait, actually, the exact mass might vary a bit due to binding energy, but for heavy ions like this, the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass, so we can approximate the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleons.

So ^6Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is ~938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². I think those are the approximate rest masses. Let me confirm: proton is about 938.27 MeV, neutron is about 939.57 MeV. So each neutron is a bit heavier than the proton.

So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass is (3 * 938.27) + (3 * 939.57) MeV.

Let me compute that:

3 * 938.27 = 2814.81 MeV
3 * 9
