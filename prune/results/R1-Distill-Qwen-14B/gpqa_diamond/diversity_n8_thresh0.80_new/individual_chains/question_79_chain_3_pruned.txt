Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify which option is the original compound X.

Wait, wait. Wait, the reaction conditions involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this is a common reagent used in the benzoin condensation or maybe in some kind of elimination reaction. Oh, wait, no, wait. Oh right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used as a base, like in the deprotection of certain groups. Wait, but when I think about it, it's actually a catalyst in various reactions—like in the aldol reaction, sometimes. Or maybe a base for some elimination.

Wait, but perhaps it's more relevant to epoxide ring-opening reactions. Because epoxides can undergo ring-opening under certain conditions. Oh right! I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (also known as DABCO) is a base used in the ring-opening of epoxides. But wait, under what conditions? Oh, wait, in some cases, epoxides can open with nucleophiles, but DABCO is a bulky base. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the solvent is nonpolar. So, if the reaction is happening under basic conditions, perhaps the epoxide ring is opening. But looking at the product's NMR, the question is about identifying the product, but wait no—the question says compound X was subjected to a reaction, and the resulting product's NMR is given. Wait, no, the question says, "the theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal..." So the product's NMR is given, and we're to figure out what X is.

But wait, the options are all epoxides (oxirane derivatives), because the structures given (like option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide).

Wait a minute, so perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation? But I thought DABCO is used in other contexts. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Let me think. So if X is an epoxide, and it's reacted with DABCO, maybe it's a ring-opening. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different kind of oxidation or some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data of the product to figure out its structure, and then compare to the options to find which X would produce that.

So the product's 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So there are two singlets for 3H each. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the peak—maybe attached to an aromatic ring or something else deshielded but without neighboring protons. Or perhaps they're attached to an oxygen, like in an epoxide, but methyl groups on an epoxide would be in a specific position.

Looking at the aromatic region, the peaks are at 6.75 (d), 7.08 (dd?), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d). Wait, the splitting is a bit tricky. Let's note the integrals: 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring with some substituents.

In the 13C NMR, the data is:

21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So, the 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon, probably a ketone. Wait, but in the product, maybe that's from an epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps it's an ester or something else.

Wait, but the product isn't an epoxide anymore because DABCO is often used in ring-opening. Or maybe the epoxide is intact. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure and what the product would look like after reaction.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, an epoxide attached to a phenyl group at the 4 position (para) with a methyl group on the styryl group.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the oxirane is attached to a propenyl group which is substituted with a phenyl group at position 1, and a methyl group (maybe) at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The epoxide is substituted with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, the styryl group is attached to the 2-position of the epoxide.

Wait, but how does the reaction with DABCO affect these compounds?

Wait, DABCO is often used as a base in various reactions, like in the formation of enolates, or in the ring-opening of epoxides. If X is an epoxide, and we're using a large base like DABCO, perhaps it's undergoing an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Or maybe, wait, DABCO is a base used in the presence of an acid. No, wait, DABCO itself is a base, so maybe it's a ring-opening under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide with a nucleophile. But without a specified nucleophile, maybe it's a solvolysis or some elimination.

Wait, but the product's NMR suggests that there might be a ketone carbonyl, as indicated by the 197.7 ppm in 13C NMR. So, perhaps the epoxide ring opened to form a carbonyl group. How would that happen?

If the epoxide ring opens under basic conditions, perhaps via a nucleophilic attack. Wait, but without an obvious nucleophile, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but then I don't see an acid mentioned.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a di-elimination, perhaps converting a diol into an epoxide. But that doesn't fit here, because X is the starting material, which is an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by some kind of cyclization. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a ring-opening but something else. Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the epoxide ring opened to form a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another thought: the epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group through a process. Let me think about the mechanism. If an epoxide ring opens under basic conditions, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, forming an alkoxide, which then attacks the adjacent oxygen. Then, the ring opens, and perhaps forms a carbonyl group if there's a neighboring group.

Wait, for example, in an epoxide adjacent to a carbony
