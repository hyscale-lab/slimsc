Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that symmetry breaking has to do with when the underlying laws of a system have a certain symmetry, but the system itself doesn't exhibit that symmetry. Like how a spinning top can wobble in different directions but the laws of physics are symmetric in all directions.

The question is asking which of the options is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion. I need to figure out which one doesn't fit.

I'll start by recalling what each particle is. Phonons are quantized sound waves, right? They're related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. Symmetry breaking in materials... like when a substance transitions from a liquid to a solid, the symmetry is broken. So phonons are probably associated with broken symmetry because they arise from the ordered state of a crystal, which is a broken symmetry compared to the liquid.

Skyrmions are a bit trickier. I think they're topological solitons, which are solutions to certain equations in physics. They're often studied in the context of nuclear physics, maybe as a model for the nucleus. Skyrmions can arise in systems with broken symmetry because they represent a stable configuration in a medium where the original symmetry has been broken. So Skyrmions are likely linked to symmetry breaking.

Magnons... wait, what's a magnon again? Oh right, they're the quasiparticles associated with spin waves in magnetic materials. Spin waves occur when the magnetic moments in a material are perturbed from their equilibrium positions. This happens in ordered magnetic materials, where the magnetic symmetry is broken. So magnons are definitely tied to broken symmetry.

Pions, okay, pions are the lightest mesons, composed of a quark and an antiquark. I remember that pions are associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The chiral symmetry is broken at low energies, and pions are the Goldstone bosons resulting from that breaking. So pions are a product of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Wait, but the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. So the answer would be the one that doesn't come from such a process.

Let me recap:

- Phonon: Broken symmetry in crystals.
- Skyrmion: Broken symmetry in nuclear systems.
- Magnon: Broken symmetry in magnetic materials.
- Pion: Broken symmetry in QCD.

Wait, but wait. Are phonons a result of broken symmetry? Because in a solid, the translational symmetry is broken compared to the liquid. So phonons arise from that broken symmetry. So all four are related to broken symmetry except one.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Goldstone's theorem says that when a continuous symmetry is broken spontaneously, massless bosons (Goldstone bosons) appear. Pions are Goldstone bosons, so they fit. Skyrmions are more like topological defects and not directly Goldstone bosons, but they still arise from symmetry breaking. Magnons are from broken magnetic symmetry, I think.

Phonons are also related to broken translational symmetry in solids. So they are all associated with broken symmetries. But the question is, which is not associated. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Skyrmions are not directly a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking? Or maybe one of the options
