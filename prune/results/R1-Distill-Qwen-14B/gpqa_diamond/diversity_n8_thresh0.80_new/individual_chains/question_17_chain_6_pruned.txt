Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The problem gives me that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh right, K usually stands for the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the ions are tightly bound.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant K is important here. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the individual ions.

But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, so what's the initial situation? If the complex is 0.02 M, that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2-.

Now, I think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since K is so large (5e10), it means that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per molecule, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. Because initially, the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into x of each ion.

So substituting into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). We know that [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M minus x, but since x is going to be so small (because K is huge), we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So K ≈ 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) → which is 2e-6.5? Wait, 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7
