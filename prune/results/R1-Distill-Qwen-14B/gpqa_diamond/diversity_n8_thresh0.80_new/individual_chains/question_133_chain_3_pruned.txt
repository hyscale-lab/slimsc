Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are HPO4^3- right? Because H3PO4 can dissociate into H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, and finally PO4^3-. So in this solution, we have two different potassium and sodium phosphate salts. I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. But here, we have different salts—KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- ions, and Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

Oh right, so KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-. So when these two are dissolved in water, they might form a buffer because they're adjacent in the dissociation steps of H3PO4. That makes sense because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so this is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be HPO4^2- I think. Because ortho- usually refers to the second dissociation step. Wait, sometimes people use 'ortho' for the HPO4^2- ion, right? Because the first is dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4^-), then hydrogen phosphate (HPO4^2-), and then phosphate (PO4^3-). So yeah, the orthophosphate should be HPO4^2-.

So the first step is to find the concentrations of each of
