Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, first, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. So its mass would be the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but in the context of colliders, when they talk about heavy ions, they're usually referring to ions like gold or lead, but okay, here it's Li-6. So each nucleus has a mass. The rest mass energy is important here because particles at relativistic speeds have significant gamma factors.

The problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, so I need to calculate the energy of the nucleus at that speed. I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

So the formula for energy E is E = gamma * m0c². I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c into that.

Calculating gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute 0.96 squared first. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let's see, 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1 divided by 0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100 → 14/50 → 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The rest mass energy m0c² is given by the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately known. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons in total. So m0 = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that. 6 * 93
