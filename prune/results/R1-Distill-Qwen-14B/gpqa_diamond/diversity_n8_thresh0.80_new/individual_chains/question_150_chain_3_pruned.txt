Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. 

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. 

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound is. The NMR data might help with that. Let's look at the NMR signals:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7, which is a high value. This could be an aldehyde proton since they usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have adjacent hydrogens. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution? Or perhaps an enol tautomer? Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like a phenol? But phenols are usually broader and might not necessarily be a triplet. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are usually singlets. Unless it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, where the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond. In that case, the aldehyde proton might be split by the adjacent double bond. Oh wait, waitâ€”conjugated systems can affect coupling. Like in a compound like cinnamaldehyde, but that's more of a CH2-CH2 group. Hmm, maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde but with some coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton? No, because aromatic protons are usually lower, like in the 6-8 ppm range. So 9.72 is more likely aldehyde.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's a doublet with two protons. Maybe part of an aromatic ring, like para-substituted, so two protons each in a doublet. 

6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet, two protons. Maybe adjacent to the previous set. So perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each having two protons as doublets. That might suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but in a benzene ring, if you have two substituents para to each other, they each have two protons in a doublet? Or maybe I'm thinking of a meta substitution. Wait, no, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the protons ortho and meta to each substituent to split into specific patterns. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of a conjugated diene or a substituted aromatic ring.

Then, 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, two protons. Hmm, broad suggests maybe an acidic proton or something with hydrogen bonding. Like an enol proton or an -OH group? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group where the protons are split but appear as a singlet because they're equivalent. But the broadness makes me think of something like an -OH proton, but wait, the integration is 2H. Wait, but phenol OH protons usually are broad singlets, but they are 1H each, right? Or maybe it's an enol tautomer, which has a proton that's part of the conjugated system. Or perhaps it's part of a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are in a position that makes them equivalent and split into a singlet.

Next, 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet with 2H. This could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2 or something. For example, OCH2 connected to another CH2 or perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, 3.66 is a bit on the lower end for OCH2, but possible. So perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, maybe in a structure like -O-CH2-CH2-.

Putting this together, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: that could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, one ring (benzene has 3 double bonds, but that counts as 4 degrees for a benzene ring? Wait, degrees of unsaturation are each ring or double bond as one. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees. So if the molecule has a benzene ring, that's 3, plus another double bond (so 4) and a ring (like a cyclopropane?), but maybe it's a double bond and some rings... Hmm, maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an amine (as in the NO), but wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: benzene (6C, 6H), then another group with 2C, 3H, and NO. Wait, maybe the structure is
