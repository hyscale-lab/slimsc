Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So this term involves the field strength tensor F, which is from electromagnetism, I think.

Wait, the mass dimension of κ. I remember that for a term in the Lagrangian to have the correct dimensions, the entire Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1), so the Lagrangian density has dimension 4.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's break down each part of L_int. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

First, fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 because in 4D spacetime, each Dirac spinor field has that dimension. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Wait no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. But σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ is also dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ is 3.

Then we have F^{μν}. The field strength tensor F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + some terms with the gauge field (like in electromagnetism, it's just derivatives for abelian fields), but the point is, each A has dimension 1 because for a photon field Aμ, the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, so (∂μ Aν) has dimension 1 (because derivative is dimension 1) plus A's dimension. Wait, wait, the field A has dimension 1. Because in the Maxwell Lagrangian, the term is like F^2, which is (∂A)^2. Let's see: each derivative is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so (∂A) has dimension 2. Then (∂A)^2 is dimension 4, which makes F^2 in the Lagrangian dimension 4, so the whole term is okay. So F_{μν} has dimension 2. So F^{μν} is dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, times F, dimension 2. So the whole thing is κ * (3 + 2) = κ * 5. So the term's dimension is [κ] +5 = 4 because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Wait wait, no—each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F must be dimension 4.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Each field has its own dimension. So ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2, F has 2. The σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless. So the product is ψ̄ σ ψ F: 3/2 +3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5.

So the term κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4. Therefore, κ must have dimension 4-5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1. That rules out options B and D, because they say [κ] is 1.

Now about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, it's dimensionless, and the theory is non-renormalizable (as in higher dimension operators). Wait, no, wait: in four dimensions, a coupling with positive mass dimension would mean it's a relevant operator, but for renormalizability, we need all couplings to have non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the renormalizability depends on whether the interaction terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension ≤4 because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the interaction term
