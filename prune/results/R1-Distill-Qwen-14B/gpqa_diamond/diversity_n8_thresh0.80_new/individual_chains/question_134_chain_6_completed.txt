Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but when concentrations are different, we have to calculate the actual heat involved based on the moles involved.

First, I think I should figure out how many moles of H+ ions are coming from the acids and how many moles of OH- ions are coming from the base. Because the neutralization reaction will depend on the H+ and OH- combining to form water.

Let me start with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each molecule gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is also a strong acid, but it's diprotic. Wait, wait. I think the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ ions per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles H+.

So the total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, meaning it's Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change per mole is about -57 kJ (or sometimes given as -57,000 J). Wait, but the question is in kcal, right? Because one of the options is in kcal and others are kJ. Oh wait, the options include both, like A and B are kcal, D is kJ. So I need to be careful about units.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting, I think. So the limiting reagent here is either H+ or OH-.

Let me check the moles. H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because it's less. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the amount that reacts is 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57 kJ (or 13.66 kcal, since 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.66 kcal). Wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J, and to convert to kcal, divide by 4184 (since 1 kcal = 4184 J). 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.61 kcal per mole.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-? Since each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to make H2O, the enthalpy is for each mole reacting pair. So each mole of H+ that reacts contributes to the enthalpy change.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, that's 0.2 * (-13.66) ≈ -2.73 kcal.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to make sure I'm calculating the correct moles.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculations.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, each giving 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles H+ unreacted. The OH- is all used up.

So the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, and moles of OH- is 0.2, which matches.

So the enthalpy change is for 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, which is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, it would be 0.2 * (-13.66) ≈ -2.73 kcal.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is -2.72 kcal.

Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

So the calculation gives either -2.73 kcal or -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but some sources might consider the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid reacting, but I think it's per mole of H+.

Wait, but let's double-check the stoichiometry. Each mole of H+ gives one mole of H2O, and the enthalpy is per mole of reaction. So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting → 0.2 moles of H2O formed; the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, wait—another point. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, both H+ ions are released. So in the case of H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+. So that part was correct.

But another thing to consider: when mixing all these solutions, the heat released is due to the neutralization of H+ and OH- into water. So the calculation should be correct.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or approximately -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, the closest are option B (-11.42 kcal) and option D (-16.0 kJ) and option A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, wait I think I made an error here. Because each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57 kJ, but in terms of kcal, I might have miscalculated.

Wait, 57,000 J is 57 kJ. To convert to kcal, 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.61 kcal. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 13.61 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * 13.61 ≈ 2.72 kcal. But wait, since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative. So it would be -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

But earlier I thought about the enthalpy change as -11.4 kJ. Because 0.2 moles * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ.

Hmm, so which unit is the correct one here?

The options have both kJ and kcal, so the problem is expecting which one?

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization". The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given in kJ/mol. But the options have both, so perhaps I need to check the exact calculation with precise numbers.

Wait, let's recalculate the exact value.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57,000 J, which is 57 kJ per mole.

But wait, wait. No, wait a moment. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.0 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), assuming strong acid and strong base.

So for 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, the change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, in kcal: 0.2 * (-57,000 J) / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 0.2 * (-13.61) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

So both are correct; but the options have both. Let me look: option A is -2.72 kcal, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "the enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed." So perhaps the formula is based on per liter or something else?

Alternatively, sometimes the enthalpy is given per mole of reaction as written, which includes all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but in any case, the calculation seems to be either -2.72 kcal or -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, both A and B are in kcal but different values, and D is kJ.

So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't only between the acid and base. Let me think about the possible reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, no. The problem is about mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So all H+ will come from acids, and OH- from the base.

So the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but another point: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in aqueous solution, does it completely dissociate both H+ ions? Well, the first dissociation is strong, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is weak. So for dilute solutions, the second H+ may not dissociate completely. But in this problem, since we're given 0.3 M H2SO4, a relatively concentrated solution, perhaps the second H+ does dissociate. Or does it?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Because depending on whether the second H+ is considered, the moles of H+ from H2SO4 would change.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the solutions are mixed." So, perhaps it's assumed that all H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 are available for neutralization.

Wait, but that's not correct because H2SO4 in solution initially is H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-. But wait, no, actually, in reality, the first H+ is fully released, but the second may not be, especially in dilute solutions. But in this case, the concentration is 0.3 M, which isn't extremely high, but in practice, sulfuric acid is a strong acid in its first dissociation; the second is weaker. So for the sake of this problem, perhaps we should consider that H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+ per mole.

Wait, but some sources say that in dilute solutions, the second H+ may dissociate significantly. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, we're to assume that H2SO4 fully donates both H+ ions.

So, perhaps our initial calculation was correct with 0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4.

So, back to the main point.

So the enthalpy change is either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: -2.72 kcal.

Option B: -11.42 kcal.

Option D: -16.0 kJ.

So, if the answer is in kcal, then option A would be correct because 0.2 * 13.61 is about 2.72. Alternatively, if in kJ, the answer is -11.4 kJ. So which option matches?

The options include both possibilities. So what's the correct unit here?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often expressed in kJ/mol, but sometimes in kcal as well. The problem might be expecting one or the other.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the three solutions are mixed. So the reaction is the neutralization between the acids and the base.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the H+ from H2SO4 and HCl will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives two H+, and Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per formula unit.

So the reaction would be:

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So the moles of H+ available are 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Moles of OH- available are 0.2 moles.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, leading to 0.2 moles of water formed.

Each mole of H+ contributes to an enthalpy change of -57 kJ or -13.66 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Or in kcal: 0.2 * (-13.66 kcal) ≈ -2.73 kcal.

So the question is, which units are the options using?

Options A and B are in kcal, and D is in kJ.

So, the correct answer would be either A or D, depending on the unit.

But wait, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately what we have, and option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than our -11.4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 moles, which will react with 0.2 moles H+.

So moles of H+ reacting: 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

In kcal, 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.61 kcal. So 0.2 * 13.61 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So negative, -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

So the correct answer should be either A or D, depending on the unit. But looking at the options, the problem gives options in both units.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in reality, the second H+ may not fully dissociate. So if the solution is more concentrated, perhaps not all H+ is available. But the problem may assume full dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the total H+ and the total OH- and find which is in excess, then calculate the heat accordingly.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so the calculation would be correct as before.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A, or -11.4 kJ, which is not exactly option D, which is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the conversion from kJ to kcal.

Let me re-calculate the exact value.

57 kJ per mole reaction (per mole of H+).

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J.

To convert to kcal: 11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.729 kcal → approximately 2.73 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is either -11.4 kJ or -2.73 kcal.

Looking again at the options: option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

So the correct answer would be either A or D, depending on the unit. But since the problem lists both, perhaps it's expecting the answer in kJ, which would be option D. But wait, -11.4 is not any of the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much higher.

Wait, did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and then the neutralization.

Wait, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles H+ and OH- react, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

The reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 moles → -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match exactly. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total volume and using concentration in mol/L in some way. Hmm, I don't think so because the neutralization enthalpy is per mole.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think about the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So that's a reaction where one mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

But wait, in this problem, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are separate solutions being mixed with HCl.

Wait, so perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would occur as well, which might affect the total H+ available.

Wait, oh, this complicates things. Because if H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they would react to form BaSO4 precipitate and water, which would consume some of the H+ and OH-.

So in that case, perhaps the initial calculation is incorrect because I didn't account for this possible reaction.

Hmm, that could change the moles available for neutralization.

Wait, so when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, they can react as follows:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But in this problem, all three solutions are mixed together: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2.

So perhaps the H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 first, and then any remaining H+ from HCl and unreacted H2SO4 can react with the remaining OH-.

So let's think about this.

First, determine how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are present.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

So moles of H2SO4 = 0.09, Ba(OH)2 = 0.1.

H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, since 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

So after this reaction, Ba(OH)2 remaining is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.01 *2 = 0.02 moles OH-.

Now, any remaining H+ will come from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4.

Wait, but H2SO4 was all consumed in the reaction with Ba(OH)2. So any H+ from H2SO4 would have to come from the first dissociation, which is complete, but the second may not be. But wait, in the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O, the H2SO4 is fully consumed. So no H+ from H2SO4 is left after that reaction.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In the reaction with Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 would donate both H+ ions to the reaction.

Wait, no. The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, both H+ ions from H2SO4 are used, and both OH- ions from Ba(OH)2 are used.

So each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So when 0.09 moles of H2SO4 and 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 react, the H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So after the reaction, the moles of Ba(OH)2 left are 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Each provides 2 OH-, so 0.02 moles OH-.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and any excess H2SO4. But H2SO4 was completely consumed, so H+ comes only from HCl.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

So, after the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, the remaining OH- is 0.02 moles, which will react with H+ from HCl.

But wait, HCl's H+ is 0.1 moles.

So, OH- is 0.02 moles, so they'll react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl.

So the neutralization reaction will be:

0.02 moles H+ (from HCl) + 0.02 moles OH- → 0.02 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change for this is 0.02 moles * (-57,000 J) → -1,140 J → -1.14 kJ.

Wait, but that's a very small amount. Let me see if there's more.

Wait, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction, any remaining H+ would come from HCl. So here, HCl has 0.1 moles H+, and the OH- remaining is 0.02 moles.

So they react, leaving 0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

But wait, the neutralization of 0.02 moles H+ would produce an enthalpy change of 0.02 * (-57,000 J) = -1,140 J → -1.14 kJ.

Wait, but that's a much smaller change than before, which would make the answer around -1.14 kJ, which isn't matching any option. The options are A is about -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. Because if they react, the H+ from H2SO4 is consumed in that reaction, so it's not available for neutralization. So perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.

Wait, this complicates things. Let me try to model this.

All three solutions are mixed, so the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will react first, as they are both in solution.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The reaction is 1:1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, so all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2.

So after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 moles → 0.02 moles OH-.

Then, the H+ available for neutralization comes from HCl and any excess H+ from H2SO4, if any. But H2SO4 was completely consumed in the reaction, so no excess H+ from H2SO4.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

So the OH- (0.02 moles) will react with H+ from HCl.

So the reaction is H+ (from HCl) + OH- → H2O, releasing 0.02 moles * (-57,000 J) → -1,140 J, which is -1.14 kJ.

But that's a much smaller value than the options suggest.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 that reacts with H2SO4 releases OH- into the solution, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because in the reaction, the Ba(OH)2 would donate OH- which reacts with H2SO4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it structurally.

First, mixing H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: they react to form BaSO4 precipitate and water.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O.

So, for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are consumed, and for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of OH- are consumed.

So, moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

They react in 1:1 ratio, so H2SO4 is limiting.

After reaction, 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 are consumed.

Remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles → 0.02 moles OH-.

The H+ from H2SO4 (0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles) is consumed in the reaction, so no H+ left from H2SO4.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

So the OH- (0.02 moles) will react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl.

So the neutralization is:

0.02 H+ + 0.02 OH- → 0.02 H2O.

Enthalpy change is 0.02 * (-57,000 J) = -1,140 J → -1.14 kJ.

That's about -2.72 kcal? Wait, no, 1.14 kJ is 2.72 kcal? No, wait.

Wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J, 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 1.14 kJ is 1140 J. 1140 / 4184 ≈ 0.272 kcal → approximately 0.27 kcal.

So the enthalpy change would be -0.27 kcal, which isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should ignore the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 because in the problem statement, all three solutions are mixed, but maybe the problem assumes that all H+ from all acids are available for neutralization with OH- from the base, regardless of any precipitation reactions.

But that would complicate the matter, but perhaps the problem expects that approach.

In that case, total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.28 moles; OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is limiting, leading to neutralization of 0.2 moles H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Which would be -11.4 kJ, but none of the options have this, except option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a larger value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H2SO4 calculation. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, but in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, perhaps it fully dissociates both H+.

Wait, but according to this approach, the calculation is 0.2 moles H+ reacting, leading to -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, which would be approximately -2.72 kcal (option A).

But why would the answer be in kcal? Usually, the standard enthalpy is given in kJ, but perhaps the problem expects kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 moles of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, so the neutralization is based on equivalents.

Wait, but the initial calculation should still hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the assumption that H2SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates both H+ ions, so the initial approach was correct.

So, given that, the correct answer is either option A or D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, -11.4 kJ is not an option, but -2.72 kcal is option A. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. The closest is D) -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H2SO4 molarity.

Wait, H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+. Correct.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 → 0.1 moles H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2 moles, which neutralizes 0.2 moles H+.

So the calculation is correct.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is only a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

If H2SO4 only gives one H+ per mole, then H2SO4: 0.09 moles → 0.09 moles H+.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ → 0.19 moles.

OH-: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is in excess. H+ is 0.19 moles, so all H+ reacts, leaving 0.01 moles OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.19 * (-57,000 J) = -10,830 J → -10.83 kJ.

Which is about -2.56 kcal.

But this isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total amount of H+ and OH- to be considered as equivalents, but that's not changing much.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 provides one mole of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides one mole of OH-.

Wait, that would be incorrect, but let's see.

H2SO4: 0.09 M → 0.09 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles → 0.1 moles OH-.

So H+ is 0.09 + 0.1 (from HCl?) Wait, no.

Wait, HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

So total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

OH-: 0.1 moles.

So OH- is 0.1 moles, H+ is 0.19.

OH- is limiting, so 0.1 moles H+ reacts, leaving 0.09 H+.

Enthalpy change: 0.1 * (-57,000) = -5,700 J → -5.7 kJ → about -1.36 kcal.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and provides 2 OH- per formula unit, but H2SO4 in this case is considered to provide only 1 H+ per mole for the purpose of neutralization, which would change the calculation.

But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the first H+ of H2SO4, which would give H+ = 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19, but OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting, leading to 0.19 moles reacting, giving -10.83 kJ, which is -2.56 kcal.

But again, it's not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the neutralization is per mole of H2O formed, but I think the enthalpy is per mole of H+ or OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering Ba(OH)2 as a monobasic base, giving only 1 OH- per formula unit, which would give:

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles → 0.1 moles OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.1, H2SO4: 0.18 → total 0.28.

OH- is 0.1. So all OH- reacts.

Enthalpy change: 0.1 * 57 → -5.7 kJ → -1.36 kcal.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

My initial calculation without considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 gave -2.72 kcal (option A) and -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let's recheck:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2 → OH- is limiting.

So 0.2 moles H+ reacts → 0.2 *57,000 J = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger. So perhaps I missed some contribution.

Wait, is there any other source of H+ or OH-?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is fully dissociated, so each mole gives 2 H+ → 0.18 moles.

HCl: 0.1 → total H+ 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles OH-.

So 0.2 moles H+ react → -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, which would be option A (-2.72 kcal), but why is option D there?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, but the neutralization enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 is different. Wait, no, the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization of H2SO4 is more exothermic. But I think the standard value is same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -57.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal.

So that would make option A correct.

But why is option D there? It says -16.0 kJ, which is much larger. Perhaps it's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole, so each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH- which is correct.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the calculations, the correct answer is either -2.72 kcal or -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, A is -2.72 kcal and D is -16.0 kJ. So I think the intended answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure because I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but my calculation doesn't match any option.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a strong acid and provides 2 H+ per mole, but Ba(OH)2 also provides 2 OH- per mole. So when they react, the moles of H+ and OH- would double.

Wait, but I think we've already accounted for that. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fact that after mixing, the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L, but that affects concentration, not the moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is diluted, but that doesn't affect the moles, only the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization is per mole of the acid and base used, but that doesn't fit.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the initial approach is option A: -2.72 kcal, but I'm not entirely certain because the options are confusing.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:** HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:** H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, and the first dissociation is complete.  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:** \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely.  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \).  
     The limiting reagent is the species with fewer moles.  
     Here, OH⁻ (0.2 moles) is the limiting reagent, and 0.2 moles of H⁺ will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For 0.2 moles of H⁺ reacting:  
     Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     In kcal: \( 0.2 \times (-13.66 \, \text{kcal}) = -2.73 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as this is not the correct unit for the calculation.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change when expressed in kcal.

Answer: A
