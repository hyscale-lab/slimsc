Okay, I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But maybe the masses aren't too important for this particular calculation. The question is about elemental abundances determined using the EW method, assuming LTE. The given data includes [Si/Fe] for Star_1, [Mg/Si] for Star_2, as well as [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided for Fe and Mg.

I remember that the square brackets in these notations indicate a logarithmic abundance ratio compared to the Sun. So, the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, actually, the general formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉. So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the solar value.

Wait, actually, no. Another point: the notation is often [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the star has the same Fe/H as the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning its Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. Same for Star_2 and Mg: [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg/H is solar.

Wait, but Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log10(n_Mg/n_H) - log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = 0 → n_Mg/n_H = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun. So Star_2's Mg abundance is solar. But what about its Fe?

Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given, only Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. So Star_1's Fe is solar. Star_2's [Fe/H] is not provided, so maybe we don't need it? Or perhaps it's given in the problem? Let me check the question again.

Wait, the problem says for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Oh wait, no, the problem says:

Astronomers have determined the elemental abundances:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

So, for Star_1: [Fe/H] = 0 → Fe/H is solar. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H is solar. [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.

Wait, but the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

Wait, wait a second. The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which simplifies to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/H = 1e-4.5, nMg/H = 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → nFe/nH = same as Sun, 1e-4.5.

Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3 → so log10(nSi/nFe) = [Si/Fe]_1 + log10(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

So, log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But what's n_Si/n_Fe in the Sun? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, n_Si = ?

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as nFe and nMg. But what about nSi? Hmm, maybe we need to find it. Or perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the Sun's composition is standard, with known ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is constructed so that we don't need the exact Solar nSi, because it can be expressed in terms of nFe and nMg from the given data.

Wait, but the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Hmm. But perhaps we can find the Sun's [Si/Fe], which would help in computing Star_1's Si abundance.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, and then find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the goal is to find (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2).

Let me try to compute [Si/H] for Star_1 and Star_2, and then take their ratio.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = solar.

We also know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 × solar.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But n_Si/n_Fe in the Sun is (n_Si) / (n_Fe)_sun.

Wait, to find n_Si in the Sun, perhaps we can use the fact that the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is given? No, wait, the problem doesn't give [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. [X/H] is log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun.

But [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [X/Y] = (log10(n_X) - log10(n_Y)) ) - (log10(n_X_sun) - log10(n_Y_sun)) )

Which is (log10(n_X) - log10(n_X_sun)) ) - (log10(n_Y) - log10(n_Y_sun)) )

Which is [X/H] - [Y/H] → because [X/H] = log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun → which is (log n_X - log n_H) - (log n_X_sun - log n_H_sun). Similarly for [Y/H].

So, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

Therefore, [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = 0.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Which means, the Si abundance in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Wait, no: [X/H] is log10(n_X / n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun.

So if [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, then log10(n_Si1/n_H1) = 0.3 + log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun).

Wait, but for Star_1, n_H is the same as the Sun's? No, no, because the star's H abundance could be different, but I think in the EW method, when using [X/H], it's relative to the star's own hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In stellar abundances, [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X and Y, normalized to the solar ratio.

Wait, another approach: For each element, we can express its abundance relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

So, since in the Sun, Fe abundance is nFe_sun / nH_sun, in Star_1, Fe is same as the Sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

But Si in Star_1 is nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^([Si/Fe]_1 + log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to express each element's abundance relative to H.

Because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

So combining these:

nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nFe_1 / nH_1) * (nSi_1 / nFe_1) )= (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * (10^0.3 * nSi_sun / nFe_sun) )

Simplify:

nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nFe_sun * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * nFe_sun) ) → 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) )

So [Si/H]_1 = log10( nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log10( nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 0.3 → wait, but [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, right?

Wait, log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) + 0.3 → so [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Which means, the abundance of Si in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Si/H] is given by the data?

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) = -5.

But the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/H]. How can we proceed?

Hmm. Maybe I should express Si in terms of Fe and Mg, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2, which might allow some terms to cancel.

Let me think about Star_2.

Star_2's data:

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H is solar.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.

So, similar to Star_1, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log10(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But nMg/nSi in the Sun is (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun).

But from the Sun's data, we know nMg_sun /nH_sun = 1e-5, and nFe_sun /nH_sun=1e-4.5.

But wait, perhaps I can find nMg_sun /nSi_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, nMg /nFe is (nMg/nH) / (nFe/nH) ) = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 = approx 0.316.

But that's nMg/nFe in the Sun. But I'm trying to find nMg/nSi in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps we can express nMg/nSi_sun = (nMg/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun /nSi_sun).

Wait, but I don't know nFe_sun /nSi_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to relate the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, [Mg/Si] in the Sun would be log10(nMg/nSi)_sun - log10(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0 → no, that makes no sense. Wait, no. The [X/Y] for the Sun is zero because it's the reference point. So, for the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero. So, in the Sun, nMg/nSi = (nMg/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) = (1e-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, but I don't know nSi_sun.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed as follows:

For Star_1:

nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^([Si/H]_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) )

Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, so [Si/H] = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0.3 → so log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → so nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3 + log10(nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Also, since [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5.

We can express nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2.

But because in a star, the sum of all elements is roughly fixed (assuming same H as Sun?), but here, perhaps we can express nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2.

Alternatively, another approach: For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, which is log10(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log10(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But nMg/nSi in the Sun is (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Wait, but without knowing nSi_sun, this might not help directly.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the ratio of the two stars' Si/H.

The question is to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

So, let's compute nSi_1 and nSi_2, then take the ratio.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1 / nH_1) * (nSi_1 / nFe_1) ) → wait, no, that's not useful.

Wait, for Star_1:

nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^([Si/H]_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) → [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, so 10^0.3 times nSi_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have two equations:

1) [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun = 1e-5.

2) [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3 + log10(nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2.

So,

log10( [ (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2 ] / nSi_2 ) = 0.3 + log10(nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Let me rewrite this equation:

log10( (nMg_sun * nH_2) / (nH_sun * nSi_2) ) = 0.3 + log10( nMg_sun / nSi_sun )

Which can be written as:

log10( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_2 /nSi_2) ) ) = 0.3 + log10( nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But (nMg_sun /nH_sun) is 1e-5, as given.

So,

log10( 1e-5 * (nH_2 /nSi_2) ) = 0.3 + log10( (1e-5) / (nSi_sun) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to express nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) → rearrange:

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2 → so substituting,

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2 ] / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = [nMg_sun * nH_2 / nH_sun ] / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )

The nMg_sun terms cancel, giving:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

Now, for Star_1, we have:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1 / nH_1 ) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me go back.

For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

We also know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

So,

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) * nH_1 → substituting,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Simplify: the nFe_sun cancels,

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

Similarly, earlier for Star_2,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

So, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ) ) ]

Simplify:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) / (1 )

Because the nH_sun and nSi_sun terms cancel.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 +0.3) → 10^0.6.

But what is the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2 )?

Wait, but I don't have nH_1 or nH_2 given. The problem doesn't provide the hydrogen abundances of either star. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun? Not necessarily. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → which implies that Fe abundance is solar, but it doesn't necessarily mean that H is the same. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to solar. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = 1 → Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H in that star.

Wait, but if the star's H is different from the Sun's, then the absolute Fe abundance would change, but [Fe/H] is a relative measure.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the total H abundance or any other element besides Mg and Fe, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the H abundance is the same in both stars. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same as the Sun's, but that's an assumption I can't make.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as in the Sun, so nH_1 = nH_sun, and nH_2 = nH_sun. But that's an assumption. If that's the case, then nH_1 /nH_2 = 1, and the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.9. That would match option A.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, if the H abundance is the same in both stars, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.9, which would be option A. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance can be inferred from other data. For example, in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H is solar. If in the Sun, nFe/nH_sun is known, then in Star_1, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → so nH_1 = nH_sun * (nFe_1 / nFe_sun )

But for Star_1, nFe_1 is equal to nFe_sun (since [Fe/H] is 0), so nH_1 = nH_sun * (nFe_sun /nFe_sun ) → nH_1 = nH_sun. So, H in Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nH_2 = nH_sun * (nMg_2 /nMg_sun )

But nMg_2 is equal to nMg_sun (since [Mg/H] is 0), so nH_2 = nH_sun * (nMg_sun /nMg_sun ) → nH_2 =nH_sun.

So both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun. So, the ratio nH_1/nH_2 is 1. Therefore, the ratio of silicon atoms is 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the answer would be option A, ~3.9.

Wait, but let me check this again. If [Fe/H]_1 = 0, then Fe/H = solar. So in Star_1, Fe/H = solar. So for Star_1, nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_1 * nH_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH_1.

But (Fe/H)_sun = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → which implies that (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → so (nFe_1 /nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → which implies nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

But this doesn't necessarily mean that nH_1 =nH_sun unless the star's H is same as the Sun's. Wait, but [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → which implies that nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun.

So rearranged, nH_1 = (nH_sun /nFe_sun ) *nFe_1.

But without knowing nFe_1, this doesn't help, unless I assume that nFe_1 equals nFe_sun. But that's only true if the star's Fe is the same as the Sun's, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, [Fe/H]_1 is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then (Fe/H)_1 = 1 → which means nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun → but that doesn't imply nH_1 is the same as nH_sun unless nFe_1 is the same as nFe_sun.

But in reality, nFe_1 could be higher or lower, but in such a way that (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the H abundance. Let me think: 

In Star_1, (nFe_1 /nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → so nH_1 = (nFe_sun /nFe_1 ) * nH_sun.

But unless nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun, nH_1 won't be same as nH_sun. So unless we know nFe_1, we can't determine nH_1.

But wait, in the problem, the [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So the H abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun only if nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

But that's only the case if the star's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's, which it is (because [Fe/H] is 0), but that's relative to their own H.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about it differently. If the star has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, then the ratio of Fe to H in the star is the same as in the Sun. So, regardless of the absolute values of Fe and H, their ratio is the same as the Sun. So, for example, if the Sun has Fe/H = 1e-4.5, then Star_1 has the same 1e-4.5. But that doesn't tell me anything about the absolute amount of H in the star. It could be that the star has more Fe and more H, but their ratio is the same.

But in the problem, without any other information, perhaps the assumption is that the H abundance is the same in both stars as it is in the Sun. Otherwise, we can't compute the ratio of Si atoms without knowing the H abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the H abundances are the same, making the ratio of Si atoms simply 10^0.6 ≈ 3.9.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~3.9, which seems to fit.

So, after all that, I think the correct answer is A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. The problem provides the following data:

1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H is solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.

### Step 1: Silicon abundance in Star_1
For Star_1:
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that the Si abundance relative to Fe is 10^0.3 times solar.
- Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], we find [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.
- This means the silicon abundance in Star_1 relative to H is 10^0.3 times the solar value.

### Step 2: Silicon abundance in Star_2
For Star_2:
- Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the Mg abundance relative to Si is 10^0.3 times solar.
- Rearranging, the Si abundance relative to Mg is 10^(-0.3) times solar.
- Using the solar Mg/H ratio (log10(nMg/nH)_sun = -5, or nMg/nH = 10^-5), we find the Si abundance relative to H in Star_2.

### Step 3: Ratio of silicon atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
From the calculations:
- [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 (Star_1).
- [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 (Star_2, derived from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0).
- Substituting, \(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.9\).

### Conclusion
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
