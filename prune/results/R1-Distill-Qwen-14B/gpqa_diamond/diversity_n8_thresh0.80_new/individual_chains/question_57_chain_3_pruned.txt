Okay, I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... right, that's when the particles don't lose any kinetic energy, just change direction. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something like a sum over the Legendre polynomials multiplied by the exponential of i times the phase shifts. The general formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ), where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, δ_l are the phase shifts, and k is the wave number. 

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction would be θ=0°, right? Because that's when the electron is moving along the same direction as the beam.

So for θ=0°, cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are equal to 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) is just 1, since P_0=1, P_1= x, which is 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, P_0=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3x² -1)/2, which is (3*1 -1)/2=1. Oh wait, no—calculating P_2(1): (3(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. Similarly, P_3(1)= (5x³ - 3x)/2. Plugging x=1, (5-3)/2 = 1. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, for all l, P_l(1) is 1. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1 are always 1. Yeah, I remember that now.

So, the formula simplifies when θ=0°, because all the P_l(cosθ) terms become 1. So f(θ=0) is (1/(2ik)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The amplitude f has both real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part contributes to the scattering cross-section in certain ways. 

So, let's break it down. The formula for f(θ=0) is:
f = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}

I can express this sum as a sum over each term's real and imaginary components. Since e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So, the entire sum becomes Σ (2l+1) [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l].

So, f = (1/(2ik)) * [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]

But wait, f is a complex number. The imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i, multiplied by 1/(2ik). Hmm, let me think about this.

Let me write f as a complex number: f = A + iB, where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part. Then, f = (1/(2ik)) [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]

So, let's factor this out. The denominator is 2ik, where k is the wave number. So,

f = [Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l ]/(2ik) + [i Σ (2l+1)
