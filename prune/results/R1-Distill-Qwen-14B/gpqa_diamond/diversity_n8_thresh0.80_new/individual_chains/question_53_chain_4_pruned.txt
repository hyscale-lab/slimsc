Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, usually around 1730-1750 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. So that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals. Let's break them down. Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, di-substituted benzene... if it's para, you'd have two sets of aromatic protons. Oh wait, no. Wait, benzene is symmetric. If it's para, you get two sets of equivalent H's. Like, in para-substituted, each substituent is opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would split into two groups: two H's each, each group as a triplet perhaps, but if they're in an AB system, maybe as two singlets? Or maybe as two doublets if coupling is happening. Hmm, but the question says two signals, so probably each group is a different environment.

Then, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are like those next to double bonds. So maybe there's an ester group attached, which is a carbonyl, and maybe adjacent to a double bond. Like maybe an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, the ester group structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but no, that's not right. Esters are usually R-O-CO-R'. So for the substituents on the benzene, maybe one is an ester and another is something else? Or both substituents are ester-related.

Wait, the NMR says two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene has a double bond. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an ethylene group (CH2CH2), but wait, the absence of CH2 signals suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or are equivalent and not showing up as separate signals. Wait, the NMR shows no CH2 signals. Hmm.

So, the di-substituted benzene has two groups. One is an ester, perhaps. Let's think about what substituents would lead to the NMR signals described.

So the aromatic Hs: two signals, so probably two sets of equivalent Hs. That would make sense for a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, each substituent is opposite, so the two Hs on each side are equivalent. So if the substituents are para, each substituent is in opposite positions, so the aromatic Hs would be in two different environments but each having two Hs. So each would give a separate signal in the NMR.

Then, the vinyl-H signals. Let's say one substituent is an ester group. Ester groups are usually O-CO-O, but connected to an R group. Maybe the ester is part of a vinyl group? Like maybe the substituent is an ester with a double bond nearby.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached as an ester. Like O-CO-OEt?
