Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to recall what I learned.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are part of the Dirac algebra, and σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric tensor made from them.

The question is about two things: the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each giving a dimension and a yes/no on renormalizability.

First, I think I need to find the mass dimension of each field involved in the Lagrangian. Mass dimension is important because it tells us about the scaling behavior and whether interactions are renormalizable.

Let's list the fields and their mass dimensions. I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime (which is standard for such theories), the mass dimension of a scalar field is 1. But wait, no, wait. Or is that correct? Wait, let's see:

In 4D, the fields are:
- Fermion ψ: Each Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral in 4D has dimensions [Mass]^4. The Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for kinetic term for fermions, like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ would be [ψ]^2 [∂] = [3/2]^2 * 1 = 9/4. To get to 4, the term is multiplied by some coupling, but wait, the kinetic term is just the Dirac term without a coupling. So the term i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ must have dimension 4. So [ψ]^2 [∂] = 4. So [ψ]^2 = 4 - 1 (since ∂ is dimension 1). Wait, no, wait: Let me think again.

Wait, each derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1. So for the kinetic term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So [ψ̄] is same as ψ, 3/2. So [ψ]^2 [∂] = (3/2 * 2) [∂] = 3 * 1 = 3. But the term has to have dimension 4, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The Lagrangian density has dimension [Mass]^4 because when you integrate it over d^4x (dimension [Mass}^-4), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have [term] =4.

The kinetic term for ψ is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So let's compute its dimension:

Each ψ is a spinor, so dimension 3/2 each. ψ̄ is same as ψ, so 3/2. γ matrices are dimensionless. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So the term is (3/2) * (3/2) * 1 = 9/4. Wait, but that's 2.25. But the term needs to have dimension 4. Oh, this must mean I made a mistake. Because 9/4 is 2.25, which is less than 4. So I must have missed something.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ. So four fields: two ψ's, one ∂, and the gamma is dimensionless.
