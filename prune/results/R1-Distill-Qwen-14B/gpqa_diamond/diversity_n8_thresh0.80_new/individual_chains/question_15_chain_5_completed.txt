Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors that influence the probability of a transit happening.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter a period than Planet_2. Wait, that means Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually indicates a closer orbit, like how Mercury has a shorter year than Earth.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So, even though one star is more massive, they've evolved to have the same size. Maybe because they're similar in size but different in mass? Wait, no, higher mass stars usually have larger radii unless they're in a certain phase. But here, same radii, so maybe one is more evolved. The host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, which might have a larger radius, but the problem says their radii are the same.

The question is about transit probability. I think the probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit. Wait, the formula for transit probability is approximately R_planet / R_star, but also considering the orbital plane relative to us. Oh, right, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a√(1-e²))) ) but wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach. The probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a/(R_s * sqrt(a² - R_s²))) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(1-e²)^0.5) for an eccentric orbit, but here both have circular orbits, so eccentricity is zero. So for circular orbits, the transit probability simplifies.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula. I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint) is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / ( (a_p / R_s) * (1 - (R_s / a_p))^{0.5} )) )? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I think it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, because the planet must pass in front.

Wait, another thought: the probability depends on the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (R_s / a)^2. Because the planet has to be in the correct orbital orientation, and the area it can cover in front of the star is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, and the probability of alignment is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). But I'm not very confident about this.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )^(1/2) ). For a circular orbit, it's (R_p / a)^2 * (something). Alternatively, I think for a star of radius R_s and a planet at orbital distance a, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s / a) )^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it more simply. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, relative to the area of the circle where the planet can be in front. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, and the star has radius R_s. The chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is determined by the relative sizes.

The probability of a transit is the area of the star (π R_s²) over the area of the planet's orbit (π a²), multiplied by the square of the ratio of planet radius to star radius. Wait, no, that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ), but only for circular orbits. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, the more precise formula I recall is:

P_transit = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )^2 * ( (R_p / R_s)^2 ) / ( (1 - (R_s / a)^2 ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should look for a simplified version. For a circular orbit, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. So, P ≈ (R_p² / R_s²) * (R_s² / a²) ) = (R_p²) / a².

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is larger, the probability decreases, which makes sense because the planet is farther away and less likely to block the star. So the probability is proportional to (R_p^2 / a^2). But wait, that's if the star's radius is much smaller than the orbit, which is usually the case.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is given by (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1 / (a^2 (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) ) ?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the Hill sphere or the area where the planet can transit. The area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the orbit is π a². The probability that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is the ratio of these areas. But wait, the planet's path is a circle of radius a, so the area where a transit can occur is π (a^2 - R_s^2) ? Not exactly, because the planet can only transit if it's within the star's disk. So the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2, assuming that a is much larger than R_s, which is generally the case.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of it in terms of the formula from exoplanet books. Another angle: the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) )^2 ) = (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2. So the probability is (R_p / a)^2.

But wait, both planets have the same mass. Wait, but the transit probability depends on the planet's size, not its mass. Oh right, because the question says both have the same mass. But wait, Earth-like planets, so same radius? Because mass and radius are related for Earth-like planets. So if both have same mass, same radius? Well, assuming Earth-like, yes. So R_p1 = R_p2.

Wait, but the question says both are Earth-like. So their radii are the same. So R_p1 = R_p2.

Now, the host stars have same radii, R_s1 = R_s2.

So, what determines the transit probability? It's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2, or maybe just (R_p / a)^2. Wait, but a is the semi-major axis, which depends on the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(M_s) = (G M_s P^2)/(4 π²) ), so a^3 = [G M_s (P/(2 π))^2 ].

Wait, but the formula for a in terms of period and mass is a^3 = (G M_s * P^2) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to [ (M_s * P^2) ]^(1/3).

Planet 1 has period P1 = P2 /3 (since P1 is three times shorter than P2).

Host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of the host star of Planet_2.

So a1 = [ (G * M1 * P1^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Plugging in, M1=2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1 = [ ( G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify: (2/9)^(1/3) * [ G M2 P2^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

But the second part is [ G M2 P2^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ (G M2 P2^2 /4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is a2, the semi-major axis of planet 2. Because for planet 2, a2^3 = G M2 * P2^2 / (4 π² ), so a2 = [ G M2 P2^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Hmm, calculating 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is approximately 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ (0.63) a2.

Now, transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a )^2. Since R_p is same for both, and R_s is same for both.

So, P1 proportional to ( R_p / a1 )^2, and P2 proportional to ( R_p / a2 )^2.

So ratio P1/P2 = (a2 / a1)^2.

We know a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.607.

So, (a2/a1) = 1/(0.607) ≈ 1.647.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.647)^2 ≈ 2.713.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check:

a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

So, a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 = 2.72.

So ratio of transit probabilities: P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Which means P1 is about 2.7 times higher than P2.

So the probability is higher for Planet_1, so researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (\(R_{p1} = R_{p2}\)) are the same. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius (\(R_{s1} = R_{s2}\)), so the transit probability depends on the orbital distance \(a\).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance and Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period \(P\) and the semi-major axis \(a\) as:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_s P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \(M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}\), \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)
- Planet_2: \(M_{s2}\), \(P_2\)

Substituting these values, the semi-major axis for Planet_1 is:

\[
a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.607 \cdot a_2
\]

Thus, Planet_1 orbits much closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_p / a)^2\). Since \(R_{p1} = R_{p2}\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.607 \cdot a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.607}\right)^2 \approx (1.647)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.**
