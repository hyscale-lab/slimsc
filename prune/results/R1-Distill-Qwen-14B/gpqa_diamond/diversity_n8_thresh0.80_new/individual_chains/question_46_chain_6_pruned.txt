Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis, which is like breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Let me think through this.

First, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So 3-methyl means on the third carbon, there's a methyl group. So 1,2 double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's count: 1 2 3 4 5. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 3 would have a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So that's the starting material.

But wait, the question says it's racemic. Oh, right, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a chiral center, which would be where? Let's see. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, the double bond is at 1, so the carbons are 1 (CH₂), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH₂), and 5 (CH3). So carbon 2 and carbon 3 are each connected to different groups. Carbon 2: connected to CH2, double bond, and two other groups? Wait, in the structure, carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it's CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, wait. Let me draw the molecule correctly.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3. So carbon 2 is CH, attached to CH2 and the double bond. Carbon 3 is CH(CH3), attached to CH (from carbon 2) and two CH2 groups? Hmm, maybe I got it wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3. Or perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, with C3 having a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of pent-1-ene as CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So that would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons long. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Carbon 3 has a methyl group. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, that makes the formula C6H12? Because 2 double bonds? Wait, no, that's a single double bond. Let me count: each carbon in a chain. 1: CH₂-, 2: CH-, 3: CH(CH3)-, 4: CH
