Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance, meaning that as distance increases, parallax decreases.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, since stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their density in space is constant? Or wait, uniform distribution in the skyâ€”so maybe it's about their apparent positions, but not necessarily their actual density in space.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. In space, the number density of stars is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume element would be the density multiplied by the volume.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's think. Parallax is 1/d, so d is the distance. So for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, no, that's not right. Because d = 1/plx, so as plx increases, distance decreases. So a small change in plx corresponds to a change in distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance. The number of stars in a thin shell (like a
