Okay, I need to figure out the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, actually, numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. But wait, when substituents are numbered, the numbering starts such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. So, perhaps the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a particular way that the positions are 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Hmm.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So substituents are 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro.

So, the ring has substituents in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. That would mean they are meta to each other? Or maybe in a para arrangement? Wait, no, 1,2,3 would be adjacent, making a sort of ortho and para arrangement. Wait, perhaps that's a trisubstituted benzene with substituents at adjacent positions.

But wait, how do the substituents end up in those positions when doing the synthesis? We need to plan the order of reactions to get each substituent in the correct position, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me think about each substituent and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (OEt): It's an activating group, ortho/para-directing.
- Nitro group (NO2): Deactivating, meta-directing.
- tert-Butyl group (t-Bu): It's a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group), ortho/para-directing, but bulky so tends to direct more to para, but depending on where other groups are.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing. So when we introduce nitro, we have to consider where it goes based on the existing substituents.

The goal is to get all three substituents in the correct positions. Let me think about the order in which to add them.

The main challenge is getting all three substituents without getting the wrong directing effects. Let's break it down.

Optionally, maybe the nitro group is introduced last because it's a meta director. Alternatively, considering that when you introduce substituents, the later ones are directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing, which could complicate things because it's a strong deactivating group. So perhaps it's better to introduce it earlier, but later substituents would be influenced by it.

Wait, no. Let me think: when you add substituents in a certain order, each new substituent is directed by the existing ones.

So, perhaps the steps would involve adding the ethoxy first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro? Or maybe the nitro is added first, but that's a deactivating group which might make other substitutions harder.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups have been added, and the directing effects are managed accordingly.

But I'm not sure. Let me approach this systematically.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), nitro (NO2), and tert-butyl (t-Bu). Their positions are 1, 3, and 2 (assuming the numbering is 1-OEt, 2-t-Bu, 3-NO2).

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the substituents are arranged. Let me try to draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which is adjacent to each other, almost like a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky because each substituent would influence where the next one goes.

So, perhaps the order of adding substituents is important.

Let me consider each substituent's effect:

- Ethoxy (OEt): Ortho/para director, activating.
- t-Bu: Ortho/para director, activating but bulky.
- Nitro (NO2): Meta director, deactivating.

Since nitro is deactivating, substituting after nitro would be harder because nitro makes the ring less reactive. So perhaps the nitro should be introduced last.

Alternatively, the ethoxy and t-Bu could be added first, and then the
