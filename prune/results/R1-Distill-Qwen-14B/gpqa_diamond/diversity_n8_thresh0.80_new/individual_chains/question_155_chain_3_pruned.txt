Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the uncertainty of the operator P_z, denoted as ΔP_z. The system is in a specific state, which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. They gave the explicit form of the state as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

So, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I remember that the formula for uncertainty is the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared) minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So mathematically, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Hmm, but wait, what's the state here? The state is given as a vector, so it's a column vector. I think I should first confirm if this state is normalized. Let me check the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

The components are (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2). Let's compute each squared modulus:

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,
(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, that makes things easier.

Since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, but we're looking for the uncertainty in P_z, which is another operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, if two operators don't commute, the uncertainty comes into play. P_x and P_z probably don't commute, so there will be some uncertainty.

But maybe I don't need to worry about that right now. Let me first compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, the state is |ψ⟩, which is given as the column vector. So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose.

But looking at the matrix for P_z, it's a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the diagonal elements are easy to work with.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since all the components are real, the conjugate transpose ψ† is just the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

P_z ψ would be a matrix multiplication. Each component is P_z's diagonal element multiplied by the corresponding component of ψ.

So, compute each component:

First component: (ħ) * (-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2 , 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, multiply ψ† by this result:

ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)
= (ħ/4) + 0 + ( - ħ/4 )
= (ħ/4 - ħ/4) = 0.

Wait, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? That's interesting. Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩.

P_z squared is P_z multiplied by itself. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element.

So the diagonal elements of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (-ħ)^2. So they're ħ², 0, ħ².

So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

Now, compute ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, P_z² ψ is:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2

So P_z² ψ = [ - ħ²/2, 0, - ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† (P_z² ψ) is:

(-1/2)(- ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(- ħ²/2 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ² /4
Third term: (1/2)( ħ²/2 ) = ħ² /4
Middle term is zero.

Adding: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, putting it all together, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes I
