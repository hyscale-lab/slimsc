Okay, so I've got this problem about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. The question is asking for the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula involving the expectation values of the operator and its square.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually, measurements are done in the eigenbasis of the observable. 

First, I think I need to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩, and the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩. Then, the uncertainty would be the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z. Oh, because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, right? So that means the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Which simplifies things because the components of the state vector correspond directly to the coefficients in the eigenbasis.

Let me write down the state vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Since the system is in this state, the expectation value of P_z should be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is just the weighted sum.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P_z? The matrix for P_z is diagonal, I think. Let me look at the matrix:

P_z is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ (for the first basis vector), 0 (for the second), and -ħ (for the third). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

Now, the state ψ is a superposition of these eigenstates. The coefficients are the components of ψ. So the square of the absolute value of each coefficient is the probability that the system is in that eigenstate.

Coefficient for first basis vector: -1/2. Its square is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the probability is 1/4.

Coefficient for second: 1/√2. Square is 1/2.

Third coefficient: -1/2. Square is 1/4.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) = 0. Because the first term is (1/4)ħ and the third is (1/4)(-ħ). So they cancel each other out. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So:

P_z² has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2. So ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(ħ²) = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

Wait, but
