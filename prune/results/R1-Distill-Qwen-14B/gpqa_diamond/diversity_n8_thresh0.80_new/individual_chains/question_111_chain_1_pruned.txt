Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The first part is about a reaction between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second part involves 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B. I need to figure out the major products A and B from the options given.

Let me start with reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, that's a cyclohexanone derivative. The substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (1-position), an ethyl group at 2, and methyl groups at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 1 is the ketone. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure should have two methyls and an ethyl on the same carbon (C2), and another methyl on C6.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction this is. Since it's using t-BuOK, a strong base, perhaps it's an enolate formation followed by some kind of alkylation or addition. Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe this is a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

In the presence of a base, the ketone can form an enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition. So the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

Now, where does the enolate form? The ketone is at position 1. So the cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The enolate would form at the alpha position, which is adjacent to the ketone. Since the ring is substituted, the positions of the substituents can influence the site of enolate formation due to steric factors.

The cyclohexanone has a lot of substituents. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The ketone is at C1. The C2 has ethyl and methyl groups. C6 has a methyl. So the ring is quite substituted, especially around C2 and C6.

When forming the enolate, the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates an alpha hydrogen. The alpha carbons are at C2 and perhaps C6 (but wait, C6 is a methyl so maybe that's not the case). Wait, the cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has ethyl and methyl, so the alpha hydrogens would
