Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice when they're visualized under the confocal microscope. Let me try to unpack the question step by step.

First, the setup: there's a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with specific structuresâ€”eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. So, structurally, both are likely membrane-bound proteins, probably cell surface receptors and ligands.

Next, the construct: it's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That means it has two coding regions (bicistronic) under the control of a loxP system, which is a recombination system. So, the vector has two ORFs, for ligand and receptor.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3', and it's fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, when the vector is in the cell, the mRNA would be processed into two separate proteins: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, or perhaps in some cases, a larger protein if the stop cassettes aren't working properly.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive the ligand's expression. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the expression of the receptor without the need for a separate promoter. So, the setup is that the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor is downstream, perhaps under the control of the IRES.

Wait, but in the construct, each ORF has a stop cassette. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, in the vector, when Cre is present, it can recombine the loxP sites, effectively removing the stop cassettes. If the stop is removed, the ORF would be continuous. So, without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression of the downstream part.

Wait, so the vector is a bicistronic construct. So, the ligand and receptor are on the same vector. The stop cassettes are in between each ORF and their respective fluorescent proteins. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, the lox sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed alongside the ligand and receptor.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So, perhaps the construct is set up so that in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins, but without the fluorescent tags. Or perhaps the tags are only expressed when Cre is present.

Wait, let me clarify the setup. The ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but between them is loxP-stop
