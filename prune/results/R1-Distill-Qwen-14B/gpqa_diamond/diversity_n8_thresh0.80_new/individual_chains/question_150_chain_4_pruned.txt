Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's given.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that. 18 -9 +1=10, divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds. Or maybe a ring plus a double bond and something else.

The NMR data is given. Let's look at that.

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H) – a triplet, maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually at the end, so maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

6.98 (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted since it's a doublet. So perhaps two protons on an aromatic ring, each coupled to another proton. Like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, also a doublet. Hmm, maybe another para-substituted ring or maybe it's part of a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a vinyl group connected to another aromatic ring.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe an -OH group. But wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe these are protons next to an oxygen, like in a phenolic OH environment, but the broadness might be due to exchange with water or another proton.

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet with 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an ether or a carbonyl group. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton each. So perhaps a CH2 connected to something like an oxygen.

Putting this together, let's think about the structure. The presence of an aldehyde (9.72 ppm) and an aromatic ring suggests that the compound might have a structure where an aromatic group is attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde.

Looking at the reagents the compound is reacted with:

1. NaNO2 + HCl – this is a typical nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization, usually with aromatic amines. So maybe the compound has an aromatic amine that's being converted to a diazonium salt.

2. H2O – after diazotization, treatment with water might lead to hydrolysis. Diazonium salts under certain conditions can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to form phenols, especially in acidic conditions.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat – this is often used for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes via the E2 mechanism, or maybe for the formation of ketones from secondary alcohols. Alternatively, it could be involved in a dehydration reaction.

Wait, but wait. The initial reaction steps are diazotization, then H2O, then KOH and heat. So, perhaps the starting material has an aromatic amine. Let's think about that.

So the starting compound's structure: molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that's an amino group.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72), so maybe the starting material is an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an amino group attached to a benzene ring and a side chain containing an aldehyde.

Let me think about the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) suggests it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually deshielded, and their protons are split by adjacent protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are typically at the end, so adjacent to only one CH2 group. But a triplet would mean coupling with two protons. So, perhaps the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group. Like R-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H, perhaps that's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a phenyl group attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and a CH2-O- group.

Let me try to draw a possible structure.

Suppose the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CHO.

But that's only 5 carbons (Ph is 6, but here the formula is C8H9NO). Hmm, maybe it's a diphenyl compound. Let's see.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation again: 5. So perhaps a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (another degree), and a ring or an amine.

Wait, the starting compound has an amino group. Because the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is used for diazotization. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group, like an aniline.

So, the structure likely includes an aniline group (NH2 attached to benzene) and a side chain that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show an NH2 peak, but it shows a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Maybe that's because the NH2 group is in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of a substituent that's undergoing some reaction. Wait, but the first step is diazotization, which replaces the NH2 with a diazonium group.

Let me think about the reaction steps.

1. NaNO2 and HCl: this converts an aromatic amine (aniline) to a diazonium chloride.

2. H2O: this might be hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Depending on conditions, diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, such as coupling, hydrolysis to phenol, or even the formation of azo compounds. But in aqueous conditions, perhaps the diazonium group is hydrolyzed to a phenol.

Wait, but after diazotization, if you treat with water, especially under acidic conditions, the diazonium salt can be hydrolyzed to form a phenol. So the NH2 group would be replaced by an -OH group.

So, the starting material is an aniline with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and perhaps other groups.

Then, the third step is KOH aqueous and heat. That might cause elimination, such as dehydrohalogenation or the formation of a ketone from a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but let me try to think of the
