Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. 

The question says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. After the reactions, they get (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The task is to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So for reaction A, the reagents are LiBH4 and H+, and the product is the R enantiomer. For reaction B, the reagents are BH3 and H+, giving the S enantiomer. I'm a bit confused about how the different reducing agents affect the product's stereochemistry.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones, but wait, in some cases, like when dealing with esters or other carbonyl groups. Oh right, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but wait, more accurately, LiBH4 is a borohydride that's a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters to alcohols. BH3, on the other hand, is a milder reducing agent, I think. Or maybe it's more selective. Or perhaps it's used in a different context, like maybe in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, in the context of ketone reductions, both LiBH4 and BH3 (like in BH3-THF) are used. But wait, I think that BH3 is more selective towards certain carbonyl groups, like maybe in the case of epoxides or more complex structures. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Maybe it's about the mechanism of the reduction.

Wait, another thought: when it comes to the stereochemistry of the product, maybe it's about the type of reduction. For instance, in ketone reductions, the borohydride agents can lead to different stereochemistry if there's a chiral center being formed. Oh wait, but ketone reductions usually don't form chiral centers because the carbonyl is planar. Unless the carbonyl is adjacent to another chiral center or part of a cyclic structure. Hmm.

Wait, the product here is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with one ketone group. The compound is 4-ethyl, so the ethyl group is on carbon 4, and the ketone is at position 2. The product is either R or S configuration.

So, when you reduce a ketone, but wait, wait, the product is a ketone. Wait, that's confusing. No, wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me correct that. The product is (R)-4-ethyl... pyran-2-one. So the starting material must have been an ester or something that when reduced gives the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, the product is a pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material would have been an ester or another compound that upon reduction gives this. Oh, wait, but wait. If the product is a ketone, then the starting material must have been a different functional group, perhaps an ester or a lactone.

Wait, but in this case, the reacting agents are LiBH4 and BH3. So maybe the starting materials are esters being reduced to alcohols. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' would be reduced to R-O-CH2-R' if LiBH4 is used, but wait, no, wait. No, LiBH4 typically reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols by breaking the ester into an alcohol. Wait, no, actually, wait: LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols. So, for example, RCOOR' would become RCH2OH and R'OH? No, wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: The ester RCOOR' is reduced by LiBH4 to RCH2OH and R'LiBH4 would react? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with other reductions.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the specific reaction here. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material must have been a cyclic ester, a lactone, because upon reduction, the ester group would be converted. Wait, no, wait. No, because reducing a lactone would give a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because the product is also a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol, which
