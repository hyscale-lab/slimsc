Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax depends on the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 arcseconds is 2 parsecs away, right?

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed. So their spatial density is the same in all directions. But wait, how does that translate into the number of stars we observe with a certain parallax?

I think about the volume of space at a certain distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell would be proportional to the surface area of that shell multiplied by the thickness. Because the distribution is uniform, the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

So for a shell at a distance d with thickness dr (so the volume is 4πd² dr), the number of stars would be 4πd² dr multiplied by the star density (n, which is constant). But since the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range, I need to relate d and parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. To find how the number of stars varies with plx, I should express the number in terms of plx.

Let me think about the differential. The number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx is what we're interested in. So, taking the thin shell approach, the number of stars N is proportional to the surface area times the thickness in terms of distance.

Wait, but the thickness in distance dr is related to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, when parallax changes by a small amount dplx, the change in distance dr is the derivative of d with respect to plx. So dr = -d d/(d plx) = - (1 / plx²) dplx. Oh, right, because d=1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx²).

So the thickness in distance dr is - (1/plx²) * dplx. Since dplx is a small positive change, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense.

Now, the surface area of the spherical shell is 4πd². Substituting d=1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2.

Putting it all together, the number of stars N is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dr) * n, where n is the number density of stars.

But we have dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. So substituting dr:

N = 4π (1/plx²) * [ ( -1/plx² ) dplx ] * n.

The negative sign just tells us the direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, let's ignore the sign and focus on the absolute value. So,

N = 4π n (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx ) 

Wait, that's 4π n (1
