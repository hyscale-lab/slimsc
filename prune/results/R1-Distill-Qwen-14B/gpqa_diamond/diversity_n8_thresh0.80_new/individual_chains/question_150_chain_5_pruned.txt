Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO and the 1H NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and we need to find the final product from the options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The NMR has these signals:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's think about each signal.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is a benzaldehyde derivative or something similar.

Looking at the other aromatic signals: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These look like two sets of doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you get two doublets each integrating to two protons. So maybe two phenyl groups attached somewhere?

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad usually means exchange or something deshielded. Maybe this is an -OH group, like a phenol, but wait, phenols are usually broader and perhaps at lower ppm. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton or part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That sounds like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, maybe oxygen. Like an -OCH2- group maybe? Or an adjacent carbonyl?

Putting this together: Maybe the compound has a benzaldehyde group, two para-substituted phenyl groups, an -OH group, and an OCH2 group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Degree of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO, let's see:

The formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute it.

The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens (but none here), N nitrogens.

So, 2*8 + 2 = 18. Minus 9 H, minus 1 N, gives 8. Divide by 2: 4 degrees. So 4 degrees could be a ring and three double bonds, or four rings, but more likely a ring and some double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, I think there are two aromatic rings (so two rings) and some double bonds. Maybe a double bond in the main chain.

Wait, the starting compound might have two benzene rings, each with substituents. Let's think about the structure.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (the aldehyde) suggests an aldehyde group. So perhaps the molecule is something like an aryl aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the integration is 1H for the aldehyde, which implies only one aldehyde group. So maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and an oxygenated group.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm peak, a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2- something. Or maybe it's a CH2 connected to an aldehyde and another group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative where the aldehyde is connected to a substituted ethylene
