Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the volume doubles. So the initial concentration would be halved.

So, initial concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acid, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration: That means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. But wait, I need to calculate how much NaOH is added at this point.

So, first, calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 0.04 L, so moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

25% titration means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, this would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the remaining moles of CH3COOH would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of CH3COO^- formed are 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but wait—the total volume at this point? Because when we add NaOH, it's a solution that adds volume. Hmm, but since the question is about the point during the titration, perhaps we can assume that the added NaOH volume is small compared to the initial solution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can approximate by considering the dilution effect.

Wait, let's think. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, when titrating, each cm³ of NaOH solution is added. Let's find out how much NaOH solution is added at 25% titration.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So, volume of NaOH needed is (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. So the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base
