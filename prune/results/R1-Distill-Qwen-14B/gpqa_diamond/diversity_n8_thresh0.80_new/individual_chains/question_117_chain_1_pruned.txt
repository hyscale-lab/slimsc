Okay, so I've got this question about isomerism, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are not mirror images of each other and thus can rotate plane-polarized light. Right, so optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where the molecule has chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are multiple choices, and I need to figure out which ones are correct.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2', with the nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the structure is two phenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. Now, I'm thinking about whether this has any stereogenic centers. Well, the carbons in the biphenyl might have substituents but wait, the groups are on the benzene rings, which are attached to the central single bond. In biphenyls, the substituents can lead to cis and trans arrangements. But wait, in this case, are there any chiral centers? The central carbon where the two phenyl rings connect is a single bond, so that's a carbon attached to two phenyl groups, two methyl ester groups perhaps? Wait, the substituents are on the phenyl rings. Let me think: the structure is dimethyl, so the ester groups are at 2 and 2', so each is attached to a phenyl. The other substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the molecule is symmetrical? Wait, if the two phenyl rings are connected in a way that the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, would that lead to any stereoisomerism? Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has axial chirality, which is a kind of stereoisomerism where the two rings are connected and can have different configurations around the central bond. That's called the biphenyl axis. So, for biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged such that it's not a meso compound, they can have enantiomers. Let me see: the substituents on each phenyl are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, the substituents on each ring are 2 and 2' (the ester groups) and 6 and 6' (nitro groups). So if the rings are connected such that the nitro groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans), but wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can be in different orientations. But do they lead to axial chirality? I think so. For example, in 1,1'-biphenyl derivatives, if you have substituents that are not symmetric, the molecule can have axial chirality. So in this case, the substituents on each ring might create a situation where the molecule can have enantiomers. So this compound might show optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
Hmm, the structure is an ester. The formula would be something like CH3CO-O-CH2CH2OH? Wait, no. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOCH2COOH, and the ester would be formed by replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with an OMe group. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)-. Wait, no, wait: when you make the ester, you replace the -OH of the acid with the OR group. So 2-hydro
