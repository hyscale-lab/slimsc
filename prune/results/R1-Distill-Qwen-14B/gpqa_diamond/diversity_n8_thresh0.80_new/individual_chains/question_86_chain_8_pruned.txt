Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B, and they produce specific products. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. 

Hmm, wait, I think I remember that these products are cyclic ketones, specifically tetrahydropyran derivatives. Tetrahydropyran is like a six-membered ring, right? So, pyran is a five-membered ring, but when it's tetrahydro, it becomes six-membered, so it's a cyclic ether with an oxygen. But in this case, it's a ketone because of the -2-one part. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone group.

Looking at the reactions: Compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give the (R) product. Compound B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give the (S) product. Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. What's the difference between them in this context?

Oh right, I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3. Wait, no, actually BH3 is a weaker reducing agent because it's typically used in more specific conditions, maybe for ketones or aldehydes. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters as well, whereas BH3 is usually more selective. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, noâ€”BH3 is typically used in the hydroboration reaction, which is about adding boron to alkenes in a specific way based on anti-Markovnikov addition. Wait, but in this case, the problem is about reducing ketones or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The products are ketones, but if they're being formed from some starting material, maybe the starting materials are esters or ketals or something else. Because if you reduce an ester, you get an alcohol, but the product here is a ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals or something that upon reduction form the cyclic ketones.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting
