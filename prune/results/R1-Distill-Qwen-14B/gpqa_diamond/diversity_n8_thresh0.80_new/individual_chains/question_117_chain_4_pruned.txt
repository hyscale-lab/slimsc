Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds show it. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule has a center of inversion. Also, meso compounds might not have optical isomers because they have internal planes of symmetry, right?

Looking at the question, there are four compounds to evaluate: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, the structure here is a biphenyl group. So two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and methyl esters of carboxylic acids. Let me visualize this. The central single bond between the two benzene rings could allow for rotation, which might lead to cis and trans forms. But wait, can this molecule have chiral centers?

Wait no, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically or not. For example, if each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. If the two rings are connected in a way that each has these substituents, maybe they are on the same side or opposite. But wait, does the central single bond allow for free rotation, making any stereoisomerism impossible? Or is there a possibility of restricted rotation leading to cis and trans isomerism, which would be geometric isomerism, not optical. Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it's chiral.

Wait, biphenyl compounds can sometimes have axial chirality. Oh right, when the two rings are connected by a single bond, the arrangement around that bond can create a chiral axis. But wait, for that to happen, the substituents on each ring must be such that when rotated, they don't create a plane of symmetry. So if each ring has two substituents, say, one at 2 and one at 6, and the substituents on each are in the same positions, but in such a way that flipping the molecule would not make it identical. Let me think: if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each benzene ring has a substituent on the 2 and 6 positions, but arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, but benzene rings themselves don't have chiral centers. Wait, maybe the central atom? No, the connecting atom is a single bond, so no. But in this compound, each benzene has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Let me think about the substituents in relation to each other. So for each ring, positions 2 and 6 have substituents. Let's imagine the structure: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate (OOCR) at 2. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the positions 2 and 6 are on the same side of each ring? Or opposite?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether this structure has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are mirror images across the central bond, then the whole molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but the name is dimethyl, so the ester groups are methyl. So each ring has a methyl ester at 2 and a nit
