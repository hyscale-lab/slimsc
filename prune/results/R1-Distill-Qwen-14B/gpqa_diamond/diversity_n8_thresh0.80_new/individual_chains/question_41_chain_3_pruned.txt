Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question says: A light beam is going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, wait. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by the refractive index. Oh right, so normally, the speed v_medium is c/n. But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm, I think this relates to the concept of relative velocity between the medium and the observer. So when the medium is moving, the light's speed as observed in the lab frame would be different. But I'm not exactly sure how to combine these velocities.

Let me think about reference frames. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as v, right? So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed of light in the medium plus the speed of the medium? Or is it more complicated because of relativity?

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n. So the light's speed in the glass is v_light = c/n. Now, if the glass is moving, the observer would see the light's speed as v_light plus the glass's velocity v. But wait, that's probably only valid for non-relativistic speeds. If v is much smaller than c, that approximation might hold.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving towards them too.

Wait, no. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam is propagating towards the observer? Or away? Let me read the question again.

"Light beam is propagating through a glass... same direction as the beam and toward the observer." Oh, so the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is towards the observer.

Wait, that might complicate things. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

In the frame where the glass is stationary (the glass frame), the light's speed is c/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as v. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be the sum of c/n and v? But that can't be right because if v is significant compared to c, that might exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible.

Wait, but in reality, when you have velocities, you shouldn't simply add them. Relativity comes into play. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? No, wait, that's
