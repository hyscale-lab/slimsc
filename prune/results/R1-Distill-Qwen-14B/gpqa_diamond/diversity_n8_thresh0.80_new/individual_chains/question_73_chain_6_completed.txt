Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition of velocities. Instead, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, I think I'll need to calculate the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy or something like that.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I need to find two things: the relative speed and the total energy.

First, the relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because that's what you'd do classically, but that's not right at relativistic speeds. Oh right, I have to use the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, but which one is u and which is v? Oh, I think u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the velocities are both in the positive x-direction, so A is moving faster. So from A's perspective, B is moving at 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but that's not correct relativistically. So the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²) when u and v are in the same direction? Hmm, I think I need to be careful here.

Wait, u is the velocity of B in the rest frame, and v is the velocity of the frame in which we're calculating the relative speed. Wait, maybe I should think of it as from A's frame, what is B's velocity. So A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. So from A's frame, the velocity of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.5*0.6 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But wait, speed is a magnitude, so maybe 0.1428c. But the options don't have negative. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c, but option C is 5.96 mc² and D is 5mc². So which is correct?

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative speed as the speed between them regardless of direction, so the magnitude. So, 0.14c is correct. So that would narrow it down to C or D for the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy. The total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula, which is gamma * m c². Wait, but wait: each astronaut has a mass, so:

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait no, wait. Wait, the energy is gamma * m_total c². So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D has E=5 mc^2. So the correct E is 5.96, so the option must be C.

So putting it together, relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between them:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (the faster astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (the slower astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \).

The only option that matches both results is **C**.
