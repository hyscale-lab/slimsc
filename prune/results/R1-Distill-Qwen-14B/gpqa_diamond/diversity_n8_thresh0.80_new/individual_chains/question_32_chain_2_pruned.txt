Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider relates to its kinetic energy, but wait, in colliders, especially for heavy ions, I think we might be dealing with the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Or maybe it's just the kinetic, not sure yet.

The speed given is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. I need to find the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Or maybe the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest mass energy. I need to clarify that.

First, I should find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons (protons and neutrons), but wait, actually, the exact mass can be a bit tricky because of binding energy. But for heavy ions, maybe we can approximate the rest mass using the average mass of a nucleon. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I might not remember the exact mass. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV. Let me calculate that. 3 * 938 is 2814, 3*939 is 2817, so total is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, 5631 MeV is 5.631 GeV. But wait, wait—wait a second. That can't be right because the actual mass of Li-6 is less than that because of binding energy
