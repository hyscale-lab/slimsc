Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember harmonic oscillators from my mechanics class, but this being relativistic probably adds some twists. Let's try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, in a normal harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is when the mass passes through the equilibrium point. The speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is maximum when all potential is converted to kinetic. So the maximum speed would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it also includes the rest mass energy. So the total energy would be gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, in this case, is the oscillator relativistic enough that relativistic effects need to be considered? The problem says it's relativistic, so I can't ignore it.

So the system's total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Wait, no, wait. No, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx². But when you have relativity, the mass might increase due to kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the approach is to use the relativistic equation of motion.

I remember that in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is more complicated. The force is still -kx, but the mass becomes a relativistic mass, which is gamma m. So the equation would be d²x/dt² = (-k/m) x, but modified for relativistic effects.

Wait, no, the relativistic mass is not the same as the rest mass. The equation of motion might involve the relativistic expression for momentum. Let me think: Newton's second law in relativity is dp/dt = F. But p is gamma m v, so dp/dt = d/dt (gamma m v) = gamma m d²x/dt² + m (d gamma / dt) v.

Hmm, but F is given as -k x. So the equation becomes gamma m a + m v (d gamma/dt) = -k x.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's better to think in terms of energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would include the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

Wait, no. In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is shared between kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy E would be gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is maximum) is all kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)k A². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But when relativistic effects are considered, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) mc², and the potential is (1/2)k A².

So the total energy E would be (gamma) mc². But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2) k A². But wait, that can't be right because E is the sum of kinetic and potential. Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, when x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy is gamma mc².

Wait, that might not be the right approach because in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy might not be the same as in the non-relativistic case. Or maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic part is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total mechanical energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) k A². But in relativity, the total energy at any point is sum of kinetic and potential energy.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. For a classical harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is (1/2)k A², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the same applies, but the expression for kinetic energy is different.

So when the oscillator is at x = 0 (the equilibrium point), the speed is maximum. At that point, all the energy is kinetic. So E = K = (gamma - 1) mc². But also, E is (1/2) k A² because that's the maximum potential energy when x = A. So setting them equal:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, this is when the potential is (1/2)kA². So, the equation becomes:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, Q. So Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then:

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + Q.

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + Q).

Squaring both sides:

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/(1 + Q)^2.

Rearranging:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2 ].

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ].

We can compute 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2 ].

Wait, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 +Q)^2 ]:

1 - [1/( (1+Q)^2 ) ] = [ (1+Q)^2 -1 ] / (1+Q)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2Q + Q²) -1 = 2Q + Q².

So,

v² = c² ( (2Q + Q²) ) / ( (1 + Q)^2 ).

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me substitute Q:

v² = c² [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ].

Simplify numerator:

The first term in numerator: 2 * (k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

The second term: (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So numerator becomes:

( (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) = [ (4 m c²)(k A²) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to factor this. Alternatively, factor out 1/(m^2 c^4):

Wait, let me think. Let me write the numerator as:

( numerator ) = [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) ] [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ].

Because,

(k A^2)/(m c^2) * [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = (k A^2)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m² c^4)

Wait, but in the numerator, the second term is (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4), so perhaps it's half of that. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute:

Let me write numerator as:

= (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )

Factor out (k A^2)/(4 m^2 c^4):

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps notice that the denominator is (1 + Q)^2, which is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Wait, perhaps we can express the numerator as:

= (k A^2/(m c^2)) ) * [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Wait, let me check:

(k A^2/(m c^2)) [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m^2 c^4 )

But our actual numerator is (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ), so it's half of that. So perhaps there's an error in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be written as [ (1 + Q)^2 ] = (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So, putting it all together:

v^2 = c^2 * [ ( (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = Q, so Q = (k A^2) / (2 m c²).

Then, the numerator inside the big fraction is:

(k A²)/(m c^2) = 2 Q.

And (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )= Q².

So numerator becomes 2 Q + Q² = Q (2 + Q).

Denominator is (1 + Q)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )^2.

Simplify:

v^2 = c^2 * [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Break it down:

We can write (2 + Q) as (1 + Q) + 1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's factor numerator and denominator:

v^2 = c^2 * [ Q (Q + 2) ] / ( (1 + Q)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps not much to factor here. Maybe express it as [ Q (Q + 2) ] = Q (Q +2 ) = Q ( (Q +1 ) +1 ).

Alternatively, perhaps rewrite the entire expression as follows:

v^2 = c² [ (Q (2 + Q )) ] / (1 + Q )².

Let me compute this:

= c^2 [ Q (2 + Q) ) ] / ( (1 + Q )^2 )

Hmm, let me think about Q: Q is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So, substituting back,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

The first term in the numerator is (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) multiplied by 2, which gives (k A^2)/(m c^2), and the second term is (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2. So,

Numerator inside numerator:

= (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator is (1 + Q)^2 = (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

The numerator is Q (2 + Q ) = (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

= [ (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to take the square root at this point.

Wait, but I'm trying to find v_max, which is sqrt(v²), so perhaps I can write v in terms of c and some factor.

Wait, another approach: from earlier, we had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as a variable, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 )

Substitute alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, that's exactly what I have here. So option D matches.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D) is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option D.

Alternatively, let me check other options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )) Not matching.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )) Also not matching.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be correct only if we ignore relativity.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic regime, the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The total energy is also equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \), which is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \).

The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, so:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: Does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: Does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Corresponds to the non-relativistic case and is incorrect here.
- **Option D**: Matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
