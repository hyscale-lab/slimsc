Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about wave functions and normalization, I think. 

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, I thought wave functions usually don't have imaginary parts unless the system is in a quantum state with some probability amplitude. But the measurement outcomes are about real probabilities, so maybe the wave function is complex. Oh, but when we square the magnitude, the imaginary part contributes. 

Wait, but the problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. That means the probability of finding a particle outside 1 to 3 is zero. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because at x=1, 1+x=2, so sqrt(2), and the real part is a/sqrt(2). But if the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, then for x <1 or x>3, the wave function should be zero. But the given wave function isn't zero outside this region. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read again. The wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i in the region where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. Oh, okay, so the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. But the expression given is valid only in that region. So, in that region, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit odd because usually the wave function is a function that we normalize over the region where it's non-zero.

Wait, but the wave function in quantum mechanics must be square-integrable and normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Since the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, our integral is from x=1 to x=3.

The wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i, but wait wait, that's a complex function. The absolute square would be |ψ|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So let me compute that.

Re(ψ) = a/(sqrt(1+x)), Im(ψ) = -0.5.

So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but then the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So the integral ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Break it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3, plus Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First Integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second Integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So setting that equal to 1:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.849. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) )= ln(2).

So yeah, that part is correct.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Rounded to two decimal places, 0.85. So option B is 0.85, which is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the wave function and normalize it over the region where the particle exists, i.e., between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where \(i\) is the imaginary unit. The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The total probability is normalized to 1, so we integrate \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\), so:

   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two parts together:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \implies a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(a \approx 0.85\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) 0.85**
