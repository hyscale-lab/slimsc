Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? So the question involves some phosphate buffer solution because they're using KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think buffer solutions are about equilibrium, so I probably need to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or something similar.

Wait, let me read the question again. The solution has 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Okay, so first, I should calculate the moles of each substance. Moles equal mass divided by molar mass.

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by approximately 136 is about 0.00735 moles. Wait, let me be precise. 136.09 is the exact molar mass. So 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007352 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. So 1 divided by 178 is roughly 0.005617 moles. Hmm, the exact calculation: 177.99 is close to 178, so 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005618 mol.

Wait, but wait—what's the formula of each salt? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? It dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. Oh wait, but the HPO4^2- comes from the phosphate buffer.

In a buffer solution, you typically have two forms of the acid-base pair. Here, I think KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So, the phosphate buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The H2PO4^- can donate another proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

But in this solution, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but in a buffer solution, the concentration of PO4^3- might be very low because it's a weak base. Hmm, but maybe I should calculate the pH first and then find the concentration.

The buffer solution uses the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But which pKa to use? Since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, that's the second dissociation step of H3PO4. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant pKa is the second one, pKa2. Let me calculate that: pKa2 = -log
