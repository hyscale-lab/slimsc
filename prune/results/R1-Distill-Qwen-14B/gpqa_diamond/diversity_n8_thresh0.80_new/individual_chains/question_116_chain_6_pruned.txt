Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem starts with compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, compound A undergoes monobromination to form B, which reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. C has two geometrical isomers, and the cis-isomer reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce D. The question is to identify D from the given options.

First, let's figure out what compound A is based on the NMR data. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H usually indicates methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests a set of two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, so for a triplet (which is a splitting into three peaks) for 6H, maybe it's two methyl groups (each 3H) adjacent to a CH2. And the quartet (splitting into four peaks) for 4H would be two CH2 groups next to each other. So, maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH(CH2CH3)2) or perhaps a diethyl group attached to something.

Wait, another common structure with such NMR signals is neopentane or something similar. Wait, no, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which has a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's diethyl something. For example, if you have a central CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. The ethyl groups would each have a triplet for the CH2CH3 (the methyl at the end), and the CH2 connected to the central CH2 would be a quartet. So, let's think.

Suppose the structure is CH2CH2(C2H5)2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it's something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that might give more signals. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative?

Wait, another approach. The triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm suggests two equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 3H. The
