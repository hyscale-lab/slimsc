Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so I think that's the Sz operator. I remember that Sz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

The problem asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by A. The matrix A has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure of this matrix.

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero because if i=j, A_ij is 0. The off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Hmm, wait, but A is a 2x2 matrix because the state is a two-level system. Okay.

The second part is to find the average value of that operator.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, I think I need to find the eigenstates of operator A because the measurement probabilities are related to how the state |alpha> projects onto these eigenstates.

Wait, what's the operator A? The matrix given is for A. So operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonals and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what this operator represents. Oh, wait, maybe it's the spin in the x-direction? Because I remember that the Pauli matrices σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if operator A is proportional to σx, then perhaps A is (ħ/2) σx. Let me check: σx has elements 0,1;1,0. So A_ij = ħ/2 * [1 if i≠j, else 0]. So that's exactly ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix. So operator A is (ħ/2) σx.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators, but let me think. The spin operator Sx would be (ħ/2) σx. So perhaps operator A is Sx, the spin in the x-direction. If that's the case, then the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of Sx, which are the eigenstates of σx.

Wait, so the eigenstates of σx are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The probabilities would then be the square of the coefficients when |alpha> is written in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of operator A, and then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates.

Let me proceed methodically.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of operator A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ      ħ/2    |
| ħ/2    -λ     |  = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are λ_+ = ħ/2 and λ_- = -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). But let me normalize them.

Similarly for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I) v =0.

Matrix:

[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]

Equation is ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).
