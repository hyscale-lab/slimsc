Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. So the question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and we're supposed to find the concentration of calcium ions. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So in this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA. The reaction for the formation of the complex would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10.

But wait, I think the formation constant is usually written as Kf, which is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, that's the formula.

Now, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Because the complex is the product, right? So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

The question is asking for [Ca²+]. So I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Using the formation constant equation: Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is present as the complex and the free EDTA. But since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that EDTA is in excess (but wait, the question says it's stoichiometric, so maybe the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex, so the free EDTA might be very low? Or is that not the case here?) Hmm, wait no. Wait, stoichiometric would mean that the moles of EDTA and Ca²+ are in a 1:1 ratio, so if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that would mean the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- were 0.02 M each, but after forming the complex, their concentrations would be much lower.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that the complex is formed from the stoichiometric amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So initially, they were 0.02 M each, but then they form the complex.

Wait, no. Wait, when you make a solution of a complex, you add the metal and the ligand. So for example, if you have Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution, they form the complex. If you have 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that's the concentration of the complex.

But in that case, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4
