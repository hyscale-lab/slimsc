Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think through this.

So the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas behaves like a blackbody and we can use the Boltzmann distribution for energy levels.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is the same for both stars, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E. Let me denote the two energy levels as E_upper and E_lower, so delta E = E_upper - E_lower.

In LTE, the ratio of the populations of these levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the excitation is twice as high. Wait, actually, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So I think that means the population of the excited state is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, more precisely, the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_upper) is twice that of the lower level, compared to star_2. Or wait, perhaps star_1's n_upper is twice star_2's n_upper. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So, I think it's that the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Let me clarify:

Letâ€™s define for each star the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (E_upper) to the ground state (E_lower). For star_1, this ratio is R1, and for star_2, it's R2. The problem states that R1 = 2 *
