Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. Alright, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. So, that's about breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is usually for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, but wait, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But this is 3-methyl, so the methyl group is on the third carbon. So, wait, the five carbons are as follows: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). No, wait, maybe it's better to write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be pent-1-ene with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no, because pent-1-ene has five carbons. So, 1: CH2=, 2: CH-, 3: CH(CH3)-, 4: CH2-, 5: CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Now, since it's racemic, that means it
