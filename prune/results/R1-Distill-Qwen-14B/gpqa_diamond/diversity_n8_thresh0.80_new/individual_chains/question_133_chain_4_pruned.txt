Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, I think. 

Alright, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that when you mix these two, they form a buffer solution because they're a weak acid and its conjugate base. Oh right, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should come into play here.

First, I need to find the moles of each salt. Let's start with KH2PO4. Its molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol. So moles are mass divided by molar mass. That's 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 1/136.09 is approximately 0.007335 moles. Wait, actually, 136.09 is about 136, so 1/136 is about 0.00735 moles. So roughly 0.007335 mol.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O. Its molecular weight is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005614 moles. So about 0.005614 mol.

Wait, now I need to think about the dissociation of these salts in solution. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which is H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-). So, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base here.

So in solution, I have H2PO4^- (which can act as an acid) and HPO4^2- (which is its conjugate base). The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, right? So the buffer system is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). 

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa do I use here? Since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka is the second dissociation of H3PO4. The first Ka (Ka1) is for H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second Ka (Ka2) is for H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. And the third is much smaller. So in this buffer, the pKa would be pKa2.

Let me find pKa2. The given Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is the negative log of that. Log(6.2e-8) is ... Hmm, log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -8 = -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed that up. Because pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka = 6.2e-8, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double
