Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, does the mass matter here? Hmm, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant for this part. I'll keep that in mind in case I'm wrong.

The problem provides some elemental abundance data using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X,sun / n_Y,sun).

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait a minute, let me parse that. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 minus 12? No, wait, wait—the notation is a bit tricky. Oh, right, the standard notation is [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y). So in the Sun's case, [Fe/H] would be log(nFe/nH) plus a normalization. Wait, the given values are 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that implies log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH for the Sun is 10^(-5), because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5. So nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's clarify. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So the equation is log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5) ≈ 1e-5.

Now, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si, Star1)/(n_Si, Star2) = ?

To find this, I think I need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Wait, but the given data is in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], so I'll need to relate them.

Let me outline the
