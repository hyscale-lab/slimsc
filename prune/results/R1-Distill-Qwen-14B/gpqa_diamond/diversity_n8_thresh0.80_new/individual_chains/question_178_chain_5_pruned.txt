Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I remember that sigma matrices are antisymmetric combinations of gamma matrices, which are used in spinor representations.

The first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. Oh wait, mass dimension is about the units in terms of energy, right? Each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of energy^4 (since it's integrated over four dimensions, so the action is dimensionless).

So I need to compute the mass dimension of each component in the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} and make sure the entire term has dimension 4.

Let me recall the dimensions. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because [ψ]_M = 3/2. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The photon field A_mu has dimension 1, so F^{μν} is the derivative of A, which would have dimension 2 (since derivatives have dimension 1, and F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ).

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ_mu, γ_nu], which is zero because gammas are matrices, but in terms of mass dimension, they are dimensionless. Wait, but σ is constructed from them, but since it's a product of gammas, which are dim 0, σ is also dim 0? Or maybe I should think about how it acts on spinors.

Wait, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is a scalar. Let me break it down. ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, same as ψ. So ψ̄ * ψ would have dimension 3. Then σ_{mu nu} is a tensor, which for the purpose of dimension, I think it's just another factor. But wait, sigma is made from [γ_mu, γ_nu], which are both spinor matrices. So the structure of sigma doesn't add any mass dimension beyond what's from the gammas, which are dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering each part. Let's list the components:

κ: the coupling we need to find.
ψ̄: dimension 3/2 each (since ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is same).
σ_{μν}: dimension? Each gamma is dimensionless, so the commutator [γ_mu, γ_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0? Or maybe not. Because σ is a tensor, it's actually a (2,0) tensor (since it's antisymmetric). But in terms of mass dimension, I think each index doesn't add anything because they're Lorentz indices. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

ψ: dimension 3/2 each.
F^{μν}: dimension 2, as discussed.

Putting it all together, the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) * F^{μν}.

Wait, no, the term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ times F? Or κ times (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν})? Let me parse the expression correctly. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, multiplied by F^{μν}.

No, actually, I think it's written as ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, but with the indices summed. So it's a product of ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. So the term is κ times ψ̄_{a} (σ^{a b}_{μν}) ψ_b F^{μν}.

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Let's just think about the dimensions.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^dagger gamma^0) has the same dimension, 3/2.

σ_{μν} is dimensionless, as it's made from gamma matrices which are dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then, F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the term [ψ̄ σ ψ F] has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian density
