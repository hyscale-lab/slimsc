Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them chiral. Chiral molecules have a plane of asymmetry, maybe a chiral center. Alternatively, they could have some sort of stereogenic element like a double bond with E/Z isomerism or something else.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have substituents that cause them to have cis or trans configurations, which can lead to optical isomerism if the molecule is chiral. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it might have optical isomers. The substituents here are at 2 and 6 positions on each phenyl ring. Let me visualize: the biphenyl has two rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then the 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but on biphenyl, the 2 and 6 positions are across from each other. So if both rings have these substituents, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomers. I think this might be the case here. So compound 1 might show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH3)CO-O- with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as glycolic acid's ester. Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but 2-h
