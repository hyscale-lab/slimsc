Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound. Let's see. The question is about an aromatic compound, specifically a di-substituted 6-membered ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that's a clue. The 1H NMR spectrum has some specific signals, so I need to piece that together.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. That means two substituents are attached to the benzene. Since the ring is 6-membered and aromatic, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But IR says there's an ester group, so one of the substituents is an ester group. Esters are usually of the form O-C-O, like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would have a benzene ring with an ester group attached, maybe as a substituent.

Now, looking at the NMR. There are six signals total. Let's break them down:

1. Two aromatic protons. Wait, if it's a benzene ring, each substituent can cause different splitting. Since it's di-substituted, the ring might have certain symmetry. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring might have two sets of equivalent protons. Like, two doublets perhaps, each integrating for two protons each. Or maybe more. Hmm, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe each substituent is causing two types of H? Or perhaps each substituent is such that they split the ring into two equivalent pairs. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, then depending on the substituents, the aromatic Hs can be in different environments.

Wait, but in the NMR, two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe each substituent is in a position that makes two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if it's a para substitution, then the two substituents are opposite each other, and the aromatic Hs might split into two sets of two. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that they cause this.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ring isn't just a benzene but maybe a substituted benzene with some groups that influence the aromatic protons. But let's think about the other signals.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually in doublets or more complex splitting because of coupling with adjacent Hs. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, maybe adjacent in a conjugated system. The doublet of quartets must be more complex. Maybe a coupling with two different sets of protons? Or perhaps it's near a branching point.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups, so all the methyl groups are in positions where they don't have adjacent CH2 groups. Maybe they're attached directly to oxygen or nitrogen, or perhaps as substituents on the ring.

So putting this together: the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R or something like that. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', like an acetyl group, for example. So the substit
