Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR data is given. I need to figure out what compound X was from the options A to D.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh yeah, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So when reacting with a compound, it's probably an elimination reaction. Maybe it's deprotonating something and causing an elimination to form a double bond or something like that.

Compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me see what the options are. Options A to D are all oxiranes, which are epoxides. Epoxides have an oxygen in a three-membered ring, right? So the reaction might be opening the epoxide or maybe forming one? Hmm, wait, no. Because the product after reaction has NMR data, so maybe the reaction is ring-opening but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction conditions are 403 K, which is about 126°C, and a nonpolar solvent. High temperature and base—maybe it's an elimination. If compound X is an alcohol or something that can eliminate, but X is an oxirane, so maybe the reaction is ring-opening by a base, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide, causing ring-opening. Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction, like a rearrangement or something else.

Looking at the product's NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each—probably two methyl groups. Then, aromatic protons. Let's see:

6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). It seems like there are two doublets of two protons each and two doublets of one proton each. Wait, maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring? Or maybe a di-substituted with some coupling.

In the 13C NMR, the carbons include two at around 21 and 28, which could be methyl groups. Then a bunch of carbons in the 125-140 range, which are typical for aromatic carbons and perhaps carbonyls. There's a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl—maybe an ester, ketone, or something else. Wait, but the product after the reaction—could that be from the epoxide opening into a carbonyl?

Wait, no, epoxides can open under basic conditions, but that usually forms an alkoxide, which then perhaps protonates. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, the product's NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7. Wait, that's a high shift. Like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde is around 190-205. Wait, but ketones are around 205-220? No, wait, I think I might have mixed that up. Let me think: aldehydes are around 95-105 ppm in 13C NMR. Wait no, wait, 1H NMR for aldehyde is around 9-10, but 13C NMR for aldehyde is around 1
