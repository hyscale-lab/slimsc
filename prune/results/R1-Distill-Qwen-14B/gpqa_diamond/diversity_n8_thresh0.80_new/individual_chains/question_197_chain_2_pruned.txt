Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to determine what Compound X is first, based on the given IR and NMR data.

Let's start by looking at the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹. 

The broad peak between 3400-2500 suggests an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid since those have broad O-H stretches. Wait, but another possibility is an alcohol. But the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O), which could be from a carboxylic acid (since their carbonyls are around 1700 cm⁻¹), ester, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. But considering the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, that suggests a benzene ring is present.

So, possible functional groups: a carboxylic acid (since the 1720 could be the carbonyl and the broad peak the O-H) and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR is given as:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid because it's a broad singlet around 10 ppm.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Each proton is part of a doublet, which suggests they're adjacent to substituents in a para arrangement. So, two sets of doublets in the aromatic region, probably para substitution.

The next peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Hmm, the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH adjacent to an oxygen or another CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) might be a CH2 and a CH3 group attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the structure probably includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Wait, but the red phosphorus and HI reaction makes me think of something else. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, no, Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, another possibility: when a compound with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, that's the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, which reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, wait, no, that's with alcohols. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI might be used in the hydrolysis of esters? Or maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, no, another thought: Red phosphorus reacts with HI to produce H3PO3 (phosphorous acid) and I2. But more importantly, I think when a compound with a carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to perform a substitution or perhaps a reduction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. Because I remember that the reaction of a ketone with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction, turning a ketone into an alkane. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, the Willgerodt reaction converts a ketone into an amine, but that's with ammonia. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that's typically with more reducing agents like NaBH4 or LiAlH4.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is an acid chloride, then reacting with HI might do something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide.

But before that, let me try to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and an alkyl substituent.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets (each 2H), which suggests that the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions. So, benzene with two substituents: one is the carboxylic acid group, and the other is an alkyl chain.

Wait, but wait: a carboxylic acid has the structure -COOH. So, the substituent is a -COOH group on the benzene ring. But the other substituent is another group. Let's see the other NMR peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H
