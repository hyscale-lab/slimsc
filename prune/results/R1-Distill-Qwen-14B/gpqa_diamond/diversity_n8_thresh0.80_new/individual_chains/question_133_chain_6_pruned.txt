Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C. We're to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, so the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, but I need to think about which species that refers to. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- in the context of these salts. Wait, but sometimes it's the PO4^3- that's called orthophosphate. Wait, no, actually, I think HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the orthophosphate. But wait, I'm a bit confused there. Maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, no. H3PO4 is triply protonated. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second gives HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third gives PO4^3- (Ka3). So HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the orthophosphate. So the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, the question says orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.

Wait, or perhaps they're referring to the HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate. I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. Let me think. Oh, maybe orthophosphate refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO
