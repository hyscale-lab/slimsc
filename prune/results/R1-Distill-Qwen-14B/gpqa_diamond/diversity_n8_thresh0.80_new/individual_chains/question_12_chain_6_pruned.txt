Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles after a pion decays. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) muon and a neutrino, which I think is denoted by nu. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible, but I'm not sure. Wait, neutrinos are super light, so maybe I can treat it as massless for this calculation. That should simplify things.

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but their directions are opposite.

Let me think about the conservation of energy here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Wait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But since its rest mass is almost zero, its energy is approximately its kinetic energy. But maybe we can consider that the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy, assuming it's moving at a relativistic speed.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its total energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its total energy is just its kinetic energy. So the sum of the muon's energy (105.7 + KE_mu) and the neutrino's energy (KE_nu) should equal the pion's rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV.

So the equation would be:

105.7 + KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6

Which simplifies to:

KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Hmm, but wait, that's only considering the energies. I also have to account for momentum conservation.

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p) equals that of the neutrino. Let me denote p as the magnitude of each's momentum. So:

p_mu = p_nu = p.

The energy of each particle is related to its momentum and mass by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the units are in MeV and masses are in MeV/c², maybe I can ignore the c's for simplicity, but I need to be careful.

So for the muon:

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c² ? Wait, no, wait. Actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So E is in MeV
