Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the given phase shifts are δ₀ =90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. But we're supposed to ignore the rest, which I think means we consider only these five phase shifts. So what's the formula for the scattering amplitude in this context?

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially for partial waves, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l +1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l / sinθ ) ) ... Wait no, maybe it's more precise. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the general expression is f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the question specifically asks for the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0°, I think. Because when θ=0°, the electron is scattered along the direction it was initially moving, so that's the forward direction.

So when θ=0°, cosθ=1. So the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known. For l=0, P₀=1. For l=1, P₁=1. For l=2, P₂=1. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the values of P_l(1). Oh right, for any l, P_l(1) is 1. Because P_l(1)=1 for all l. So that simplifies things a bit.

So the amplitude f at θ=0 would be (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} ) ), summed over l. But wait, what's k in this context? Oh, k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the incoming electrons. The energy is given as 50 MeV electrons.

Wait, but electrons have rest mass, so perhaps we need to compute k from their kinetic energy. Hmm. Let me think about that. The energy E is given as 50 MeV. For electrons, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger than the rest mass. So we can probably treat this as a high-energy (relativistic) case, but perhaps it's easier to compute k using non-relativistic mechanics first, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe the formula involves the momentum p, which is related to k, since k = p/ħ. Because for a free particle, E = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE). But wait, for relativistic particles, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), but since E is given as 50 MeV which is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV), perhaps we can approximate p ≈ E/c. But I'm not entirely certain about this.

Wait, the problem is about scattering amplitude, and the options are given in fm, which is 1e-15 meters. Hmm. Let me see. The wave number k is 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require me to compute k. Because looking at the options, they're all numbers multiplied by fm. Let me think about the formula again. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im f(θ=0). So let's write the expression for f(θ=0):

f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} )

Since e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, when we take the imaginary part, we can ignore the real parts because Im (e^{iδ_l}) is sin δ_l.

So Im f(θ=0) = (1/(2k)) Σ ( (2l +1) sin δ_l )

Because the imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} is sin δ_l, and the sum over l includes all the phase shifts given. Wait, but wait, what about the factor of 1/(2ik) multiplied by (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}, and then taking the imaginary part. Let me write it more accurately.

The expression is f = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} )

So the imaginary part of f is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) Σ ( (2l +1) sin δ_l )

Ah, because when you expand e^{iδ}, the imaginary part is sin δ. So the sum is over all the phase shifts, and for each l, (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l). Then all that multiplied by 1/(2k).

So now, I need to compute this sum: for each given δ_l, compute (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), then sum them all, and then multiply by 1/(2k).

But wait, the given phase shifts are only up to δ_4, which probably corresponds to l=4. Wait, because the phase shifts are labeled as δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So let's list all the (2l+1) values:

l=0: 1
l=1:3
l=2:5
l=3:7
l=4:9

So for each l, multiply (2l+1) by sin(δ_l), then sum all.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(90°)
sin(90) is 1. So 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)
What's sin(67°)? Approximately 0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55°)
sin(55°) ≈0.8192. 5 *0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)
sin(30) is 0.5. 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°)
sin(13) ≈0.22495. 9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 ≈3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 + 2.02455=13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Now, the next step is to compute 1/(2k) multiplied by this sum, but I need to find what k is.

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number, which is p/(ħ), where p is the momentum. Alternatively, since E = p²/(2m) for non-relativistic, but since E is 50 MeV which is much higher than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), perhaps relativistic expressions are needed.

But perhaps in this problem, we can approximate k as sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Let me proceed.

But wait, E is given as 50 MeV. Let me compute the momentum p. Using relativistic energy:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

But since E is much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c). So let's compute p as 50 MeV / c.

But wait, the units: The momentum p would be in MeV/c units. Then, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c) * c = p/(ħ), but wait, no. Let me think in terms of units.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. But in particle physics, it's often convenient to work in units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Wait, because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So 197.33 MeV·fm is approximately ħ c.

So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV
