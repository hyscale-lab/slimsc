Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they have chiral centers. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I should think this through step by step.

The question lists four moieties, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each selecting a different combination of the four.

Let me look at each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, so this is a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, so does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetric, maybe it's not chiral. But wait, the positions are 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate and 6 and 6' for the dinitro. So the substituents on each ring are both at 2 and 6. Let me visualize: the two benzene rings are connected at 1 and 1', so each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The arrangement around each ring would be 2,6-dinitro and 2,6-dicarboxylate. Wait, but wait, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry? Because the two rings are connected, the substituents on each are symmetric. So if the substituents on each phenyl ring are in positions that are symmetric, does that make the whole molecule achiral? Like if each ring has the same groups in equivalent positions, then the whole molecule might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the connection allows for a plane of symmetry, then maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have a twist, leading to cis or trans isomerism. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which relates to chirality, not geometric isomerism. So if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomers.

Wait, what about the substituents? Let me see: the groups are at 2 and 2' (for the dicarboxylate) and 6 and 6' (dinitro). So each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6. Are these positions equivalent in a way that creates a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is symmetric, then it can't be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a chiral center on the biphenyl. Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected by a single bond, so the rotation around that bond would allow for different conformations, but that's not the same as being a stereocenter. Wait, no, the actual substituents on the ringsâ€”each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. Wait, but each ring is a benzene ring attached to the central bond. So, each ring has two substituents at positions 2 and 6, but that's symmetric. So if the substituents are the same on each ring, maybe the molecule is symmetric and hence not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center (tetrahedral with four different groups) or have a plane of asymmetry.

Wait, the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each ring has two substituents. The substituents on each ring are two groups: nitro and carboxylate ester. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, if each ring has two substituents that are on opposite sides, then perhaps the molecule as a
