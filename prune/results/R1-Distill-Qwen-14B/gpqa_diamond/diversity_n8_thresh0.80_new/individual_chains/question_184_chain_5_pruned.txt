Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis reactions. Let me take a deep breath and break it down.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the target molecule. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Breaking it down:
- Position 1: ethoxy group (OEt)
- Position 2: tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3, wait no, tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-)
- Position 3: nitro group (NO2)

Wait, wait. Wait, no: the numbering might be a bit different. Let's clarify. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, tert-butyl at position 2. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. That would make them all meta to each other, but in a benzene ring, that's a vicinal arrangement.

Wait, actually, 1,2,3 positions are adjacent. So it's a para arrangement? Wait no, benzene is a ring. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so the substituents are all next to each other. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So when looking at the ring, substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other? Wait, no. Let me imagine the numbering: 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are across one position, so they're meta relative to each other. So substituents at 1,2,3 are all in adjacent positions.

Wait, in benzene, each position is adjacent to two others. So 1,2,3 would be a row of three substit
