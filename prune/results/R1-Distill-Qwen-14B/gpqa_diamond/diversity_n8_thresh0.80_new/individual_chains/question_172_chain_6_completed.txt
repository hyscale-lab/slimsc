Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the problem says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small part of the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium with the radiation field.

Wait, when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, I'm thinking that must relate to their excitation energy. Oh right, in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is exponential of minus delta energy over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). In this case, star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state compared to star_2. Let me define the energy levels. Let's say E_2 is higher than E_1 by delta E, which is 1.38e-23 J. So for star_1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 (since twice as excited, so n2 is higher). For star_2, the ratio is n2_2 / n1_2 = 1, because they are at their own temperature.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equations. Let me think: for star 1, the ratio of excited to lower level is 2. For star 2, it's 1.

So, for star_1: (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 = exp( -delta E / (k T_1) )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the energy difference is E_high - E_low = delta E. So the ratio is n_high / n_low = exp( - delta E / (k T) ). So for star_1, n_high / n_low = 2. For star_2, n_high / n_low =1.

So, for star_1:
2 = exp( - delta E / (k T_1) )

For star_2:
1 = exp( - delta E / (k T_2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides for each equation.

For star_1: ln(2) = - delta E / (k T_1)
So, ln(2) = - (delta E) / (k T_1 )

For star_2: ln(1) = - (delta E) / (k T_2 )

Since ln(1) is zero, the equation for star_2 becomes 0 = - delta E/(k T_2 ) → delta E/(k T_2 )=0. But wait, delta E is not zero, so this would imply T_2 is infinite. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I got the energy difference backwards. Maybe because for star_2, the population is lower, so the ratio is lower. Let me think again.

Wait no, the ratio for star_2 is 1, which implies that the high and low energy levels are equally populated. That would happen when the exponent is zero, so delta E/(k T) = 0 → T approaches infinity. But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me denote the ratio for each star. For star_1, the ratio is R1 = 2 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) ). For star_2, R2 = 1 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) ).

Taking natural logs, ln R1 = - delta E/(k T1) → ln 2 = - delta E/(k T1 )

ln R2 = - delta E/(k T2) → ln 1 = 0 = - delta E/(k T2 ) → so delta E/(k T2) = 0 → delta E is zero, but that's not the case. So perhaps I got the equation reversed.

Wait, maybe the formula is n_high / n_low = exp( (E_high - E_low)/(k T) ) * (other factors?), but wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is n_i = (g_i / g_j) exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) multiplied by n_j. So, if E_high > E_low, then the ratio n_high / n_low is proportional to exp( -(E_high - E_low)/(k T) ), which is exp(-delta E/(k T)).

Wait, but for star_2, the ratio is 1, so 1 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) ), which implies that -delta E/(k T2) = 0 → delta E must be zero, which it's not. Hence, this suggests that perhaps I should set up the equation in another way.

Alternatively, maybe I should write the ratio for each star and then take the ratio of those ratios.

Let me think: For star_1, the ratio is R1 = 2 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

For star_2, the ratio is R2 = 1 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Wait, but if delta E is positive, then for R2 to be 1, the exponent must be zero. So delta E/(k T2) =0 → T2 is infinite, which is not possible. So perhaps I have an error in my setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for star_2, the ratio is R2 = n2_2 / n1_2 = 1. So according to the Boltzmann equation, that's exp( - delta E/(k T2) ) =1 → so the exponent must be zero, which would require delta E =0. But that's impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I should write for each star, the population ratio, and then take the ratio of the two.

So, for star_1: n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_2 / n1_2 = 1 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Now, if I divide R1 by R2, I get (n2_1/n1_1)/(n2_2/n1_2) = 2/1 = 2.

But since each ratio is exp(-delta E/(k T)), then the ratio is exp( [delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) ] )

Wait, let me compute R1/R2:

R1/R2 = (n2_1/n1_1) / (n2_2/n1_2) ) = [exp( -delta E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -delta E/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (delta E/(k T2) ) - (delta E/(k T1) )) )

So, 2 = exp( delta E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (delta E/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, but I don't know delta E, but perhaps I can find a relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, but delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's see, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, delta E is 1.38e-23 J, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E = k * T, where T would be about 1 K. But let me compute delta E/(k). So 1.38e-23 J divided by 1.38e-23 J/K is 1 K. So delta E/(k) =1 K.

So substituting into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

But the options are in terms of ln(2) equals some function. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2)= (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Step 1: Set up the equations for the two stars
For star_1, the ratio of excited to lower energy levels is \( 2 \), so:
\[
2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right).
\]

For star_2, the ratio is \( 1 \), so:
\[
1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

### Step 2: Take the natural logarithm
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides for star_1:
\[
\ln(2) = -\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}.
\]

For star_2, taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(1) = 0 = -\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

This implies \( \Delta E / (kT_2) = 0 \), which is only possible if \( T_2 \) is infinite, an unphysical result. To resolve this, consider the ratio of the two population ratios:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Given \( R_1 = 2 \) and \( R_2 = 1 \), this becomes:
\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 3: Simplify using \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), so:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:
\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
The equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct equation is:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option D**.
