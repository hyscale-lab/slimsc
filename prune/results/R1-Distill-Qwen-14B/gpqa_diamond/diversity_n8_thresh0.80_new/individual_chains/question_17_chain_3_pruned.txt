Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. So the question is, what's the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant K is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So in this case, the K is quite large, 5e10, which suggests that the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca and EDTA would be tied up in the complex.

The solution given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the stoichiometry is 1:1, so each formula unit has one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- (or something like that), but the exact charge isn't super important right now.

I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, the setup is that Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or some similar charge, but the exact charge might not matter for the K expression).

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait a second, the way the problem is phrased, the solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means that initially, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both zero. But wait, no, that's not right. Because in solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the actual concentrations aren't zero, but very small.

So the complex dissociates a little, and we need to find the [Ca²+], which will be equal to [EDTA^4-] because the reaction is 1:1.

So let me set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] =
