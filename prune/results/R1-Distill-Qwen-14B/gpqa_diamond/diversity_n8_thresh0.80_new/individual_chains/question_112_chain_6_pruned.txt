Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring the electron in certain eigenstates and then the average value of an operator. 

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, since it's proportional, I probably need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the state vector needs to have a norm of 1.

So the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. I'll calculate the norm squared. The norm squared of |alpha> is |a|^2 times [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ].

Calculating each term: |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so |1+i|^2 is 2. Similarly, |2-i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(5), so |2-i|^2 is 5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), but since |alpha> is already multiplied by a, the norm is |a|^2 *7 =1. So a^2 =1/7. Therefore, a=1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, else 0. Wait, but in a 2x2 matrix, the indices would be for up and down. So elements are A_11=0, A_12= hbar/2, A_21= hbar/2, A_22=0. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Oh, wait, that's actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, the eigenstates of this operator A would be the eigenvectors of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |-x> basis. Because the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the operator is diagonal in this basis.

So let's compute the expansion coefficients. Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>. Let's solve for c1 and c2.

We can write |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Expressed in the |+x> and |-x> basis:

Express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substitute into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ |+x> + |-x> ] / sqrt(2) + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * [ |+x> - |-x> ] / sqrt(2 )

Let's factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

So:

|alpha> = [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Combine terms:
