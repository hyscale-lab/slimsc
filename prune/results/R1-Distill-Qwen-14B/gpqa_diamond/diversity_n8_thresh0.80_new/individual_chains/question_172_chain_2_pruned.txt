Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me see. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the number of atoms in the higher energy state is twice as much in star_1. I think the Boltzmann distribution tells us the ratio of populations in two energy levels. 

The Boltzmann equation is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), right? Where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Since the problem states that the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, but I'm not sure if I need that number right away.

Wait, in this case, both stars are being compared. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1')/(n2') = 2, and for star_2 as (n1'')/(n2'') = 1? Or wait, no, wait. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, perhaps.

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the ratio as n_upper/n_lower for each star. Let's let the upper level be level 2 and the lower level be level 1. So for star_1, n2/n1 = 2 for star_2, it's 1. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio is n2_1/n1_1 = 2*(n2_2/n1_2). Wait, no, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1. So maybe for the same energy levels, the population ratio is higher in star_1. So that would mean (n2_1)/(n1_1) = 2 * (
