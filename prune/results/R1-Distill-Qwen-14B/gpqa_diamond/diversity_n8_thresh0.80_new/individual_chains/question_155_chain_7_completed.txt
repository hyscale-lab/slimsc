Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. 

Alright, the setup. The operator P has components Px, Py, Pz. Each is given as a matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So I'm working in the eigenbasis of P_z, which probably means P_z is diagonal in this basis. Let me check the matrix for P_z.

Looking at P_z's matrix: first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So yeah, it's diagonal. So the basis vectors are the standard basis vectors, I think. So the eigenstates of P_z are |1>, |2>, |3>, which are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) respectively. And their corresponding eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So that's a state |ψ> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ).

Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, calculating <P_z> and <P_z²> might be straightforward.

Wait, let me think about <P_z>. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of being in each state. So each component of |ψ> squared gives the probability for each eigenstate.

So the state |ψ> has components a, b, c where a = -1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c= -1/2. So probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

Calculating each:
|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
|b|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.
|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the expectation <P_z> is (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ). Let's see: ( (1/4 - 1/4) ) * ħ + (1/2)*0. That's zero. So <P_z> is zero. That's interesting.

Now, <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, each eigenstate has eigenvalue squared. So for each state |i>, the eigenvalue is e_i. So e_i squared. So for |1>, e1 is ħ, e1² is ħ². For |2>, it's zero, so e2² is zero. For |3>, e3 is -ħ, so e3² is ħ².

So <P_z²> is |a|^2 * ħ² + |b|^2 *0 + |c|^2 * ħ². So that's (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ². Adding those: (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2. So <P_z²> = (1/2) ħ².

Now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ). So sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's option B. So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Let me double-check. The state is a superposition of |1>, |2>, |3>. The probabilities are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4. So when you square the coefficients, the expectation of P_z is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0. So that's correct. The expectation of P_z squared is (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/2) ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ/sqrt(2). Yep, that's right.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Basis
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ corresponding to the eigenstates $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The state of the system is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation Value of $P_z$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$), and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Expectation Value of $P_z^2$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the eigenvalues and probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Uncertainty in $P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
