Okay, so I have this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each more massive than our Sun. The problem gives me some abundance ratios, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio [Si/Star_1] over [Si/Star_2], right? Or wait, no, actually, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's [Si]_1 divided by [Si]_2. But wait, let me read the question again to make sure.

The problem gives me [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. 

I remember that [X/Y]_star means log10(n_X /n_Y)_star minus log10(n_X /n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic ratio relative to the Sun. 

Wait, so [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So if it's zero, nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun. Same goes for Star_2's [Mg/H] = 0, so [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so nMg/nH in Star_2 is same as Sun.

So let's think about each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is solar. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3. So the first term is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) and the second is [Si/Fe]_sun. So nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 / nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) = 0.3 → nMg_2 / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H is solar. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Wait, nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, nH_1 = (nH_sun) * (nFe_1 / nFe_sun).

Wait, maybe I should express all the elements in terms of H for each star.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1:

nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun * nH_1 → because (Fe/H)_1 =0 → Fe/H is same as Sun.

Wait, no: [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) = 0 → so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_1's [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1 from earlier, nSi_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun * nH_1) × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun)

Simplify: nSi_1 = nH_1 × (nFe_sun /n
