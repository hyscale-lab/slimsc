Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can choose which one to observe when they have limited time.

The setup says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since its orbital period is shorter. Also, both have circular orbits, which is good because that might simplify the calculations.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so Planet_1's star is more massive but not bigger in radius. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. I'm trying to remember how a star's mass and radius affect the probability of a planet transiting.

The probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do we calculate that probability? I think the formula involves the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh right, the probability P is roughly (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's more accurate to say the probability is proportional to the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. So P ≈ (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I've heard it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, squared, multiplied by something else, but perhaps for the purpose of comparing two planets, the exact constants might cancel out.

Wait, another thought. The semi-major axis a can be related to the orbital period using Kepler's third law. So for each planet, since their masses are the same, but their host stars' masses are different. Kepler's law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_s + M_p) / (M_sun), but since the planet's mass is much smaller, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So a^3 ∝ (M_s) * P^2. So a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, but let's think through. Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 3*P1. Host star mass M1 = 2*M2. So for Planet_1:

a1^3 / (P1)^2 = M1 / (M_sun) → a1^3 = (M1 / M_sun) * P1^2.

Similarly for Planet_2:

a2^3 = (M2 / M_sun) * (P2)^2.

Substituting P2 = 3 P1, M1 = 2 M2:

a1^3 = (2 M2 / M_sun) * P1^2.

a2^3 = (M2 / M_sun) * (9 P1^2) → 9 M2 P1^2 / M_sun.

So a2^3 = (9/2) * (2 M2 P1^2 / M_sun) ) → a2^3 = (9/2) * a1^3.

Wait, no, let's compute a1 and a2:

Compute a1:

a1 = [ ( (2 M2) * (P1^2) ) / (M_sun) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ (M2 * (3 P1)^2 ) / (M_sun) ]^(1/3) = [ (M2 *9 P1^2 ) / (M_sun) ]^(1/3) = [9 M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3).

So a2 = [ 9 * M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3 ) = [ 9 * ( (M2 P1^2 ) / M_sun ) ]^(1/3 ) = 9^(1/3) * [ M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3 ).

But a1 is [2 M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3 ) → a1 = 2^(1/3) * [ M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3 ).

So a2 = 9^(1/3) * [ M2 P1^2 / M_sun ]^(1/3 ) = (9/2)^(1/3) * a1.

Wait, because a1 is 2^(1/3) times [ ... ] and a2 is 9^(1/3) times the same [ ... ] part. So the ratio a2/a1 is [9/(2)]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

9 is 3^2, 2 is 2^1. So 9/2 = (3^2)/(2^1) → (9/2)^(1/3) is (3^2/2)^(1/3) → which is approximately cube root of 4.5. So cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65 because 1.6^3 is 4.096 and 1.65^3 is about 4.49, close to 4.5.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. The probability of transit depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the transit probability is given by (R_s / a)² multiplied by (something related to the orbital inclination, but since we don't know that, we assume it's randomly distributed, so the probability is (R_s / a)^2 times a function that includes the solid angle, but I think for approximation it's often considered as (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2, but sometimes it's (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), giving (R_s/a)^3? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the probability of transit is proportional to (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * (1/(1 - e^2))^(3/2), but for
