Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as just subtracting the two speeds because you can't go faster than light. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, from special relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, I think we subtract the smaller speed from the larger? Or wait, no, I think the formula is for when the velocities are relative to the same frame. So if one is moving at u and the other at v, then the relative speed of one from the other's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Yeah, that's right. Because when u and v are in the same direction, the relative speed is u - v, but you have to account for the relativity.

Let me plug in the numbers. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but that's non-relativistic. The relativistic formula would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) where u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So u is the speed of A, and we're finding the speed of B relative to A.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. If A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then in A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0
