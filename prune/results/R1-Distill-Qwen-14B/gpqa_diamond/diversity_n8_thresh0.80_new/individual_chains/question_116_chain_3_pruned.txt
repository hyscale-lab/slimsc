Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, Compound A undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. I need to identify what Compound D is.

The options given are four different cyclohex-enol derivatives. So, probably, this involves some cyclohexane ring formation through a Diels-Alder reaction or something similar. Let me break it down.

First, let's look at Compound A's NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests perhaps two equivalent CH2 groups adjacent to a CH3. Because a triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, let me think: for a triplet for 6H, if it's a CH2CH3 group, each end would have 3H. But 0.9 is a low chemical shift, typical for CH3 groups attached to something maybe more substituted.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H could be two CH2CH3 groups, but each would have 3H as a triplet. Or maybe a central CH2 with two CH3 groups on either side? Wait, no, because that would be more like a quartet or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 3H group next to another 3H, leading to a triplet. Let me think about the splitting. If a CH3 is next to a CH2, the triplet would come from the coupling between the CH2 and the two CH3 groups. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the triplet is from a CH2CH2CH3 structure, but that seems unlikely. Another thought: if you have a CH2 adjacent to a CH3, the CH3 would split the CH2 into a quartet, but in the NMR given here, the quartet is the second signal.

Wait, the NMR data: triplet at 0.9 ppm
