Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, pion plus decaying into mu plus and a neutrino. The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But wait, neutrinos are super light, right? Like, their mass is negligible compared to the muon's. So maybe I can approximate the neutrino as massless in this calculation.

Wait, but the problem gives the masses of the Pi+ and muon. The Pi+ has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass isn't given, but I think for neutrinos, in particle physics, we often neglect their mass because they're so small. So, the neutrino might be treated as massless here.

So, the decay process is at rest, so the initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion. The rest energy is m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV. The products are the muon and the neutrino. Their energies would each have a rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So its energy is approximately its kinetic energy
