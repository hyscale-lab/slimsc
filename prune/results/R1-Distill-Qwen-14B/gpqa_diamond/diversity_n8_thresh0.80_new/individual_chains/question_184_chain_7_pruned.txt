Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait, numbering might be tricky here. In benzene, the numbering starts at a position to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, if substituents are at 1, 2, 3, that's adjacent, but I think the actual positions might be 2,3,4 maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1, 2, and 3. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So substituents are ortho, meta, and para? No, in this case, it's 1,2,3 positions. So it's like substituents are on positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me draw it mentally.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine substituent at position 1 (ethoxy), position 2 (t-Bu), and position 3 (nitro). So, positions 1,2,3 are consecutive. That makes the substituents all adjacent. Wait, but that's a bit crowded, but okay.

Now, I need to think about how to synthesize this from benzene. The options are four sequences of reactions, each with multiple steps. So I need to determine the correct order of reactions to get the substituents in the correct positions with high yield.

I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents can direct incoming groups to certain positions. For example, activating groups (like -OCH2CH3, ethoxy) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

Wait, but wait, the order in which substituents are added affects the positions where the next substituent will go. So the strategy is to decide the order of adding substituents considering their directing effects.

So, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's consider each substituent's nature.

Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and is an activating, ortho/para-directing group since it's an alkyl group.

Wait, but wait: t-Bu is a bulky substituent. So when adding
