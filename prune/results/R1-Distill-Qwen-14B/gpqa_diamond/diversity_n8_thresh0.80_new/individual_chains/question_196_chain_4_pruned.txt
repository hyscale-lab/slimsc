Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are common in physics, both classical and quantum. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I need to think about how relativity affects the system.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given, so I'll have to derive the expression and see which one matches.

In classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is found when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so that formula probably isn't correct.

Relativistic mechanics includes things like the gamma factor, right? So the mass increases with velocity as mγ, where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way as classical mechanics. Maybe I should think about total energy.

The total energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy. But how do these energies relate? In the classical case, at maximum displacement (amplitude A), all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is more complicated. Let me think.

Wait, the potential energy for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², similar to the classical case. But the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So maybe I need to set the potential energy at maximum displacement equal to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total mechanical energy in the classical case is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, I think the total energy is higher because it includes the rest mass energy. Or is it treated differently?

Hmm, maybe I should start from energy conservation. At the maximum displacement,
