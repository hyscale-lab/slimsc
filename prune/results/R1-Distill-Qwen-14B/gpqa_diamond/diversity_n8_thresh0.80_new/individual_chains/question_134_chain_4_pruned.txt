Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I remember.

The question is: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, since there are multiple acids and a base, I need to figure out how they all react together.

Wait, wait, maybe I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because moles will determine how much reaction can occur, right?

Let me list out the acids and the base:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
2. H2SO4: It's a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole can donate two H+ ions.
3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Since it's Ba(OH)2, each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

So, first, calculate the moles for each.

Starting with HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, the total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in a neutralization reaction, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio to form water. So total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So which one is the limiting reactant here? Because the H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the neutralization reaction will use up 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of water formed is 0.2 moles (since each H+ and OH- makes one H2O).

Wait, but how does the enthalpy come into play here? Oh right, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. But wait, I think the standard enthalpy is for one mole of H+ and one of OH- reacting. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it releases a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid or base. For example, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is around -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H+). So for each mole of H+ reacting with OH-, about -57 kJ is released.

But wait, wait,
