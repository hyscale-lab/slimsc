Okay, I need to tackle this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Let me go through each option step by step.

So the matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix.

The options are about properties related to quantum mechanics. Let's recall some concepts.

First, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities.

The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that U† U = I, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

Now, looking at each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The exponential of a matrix e^X is a matrix exponential. For the norm of a vector to change when multiplied by this matrix, e^X must not be unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm (i.e., ||Uv|| = ||v|| for any vector v).

So I need to check if e^X is unitary. But wait, e^X is unitary only if X is skew-Hermitian. Because for a matrix X, if X is skew-Hermitian (X† = -X), then e^X is unitary. Let me see if X is skew-Hermitian.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

To check if X is skew-Hermitian, X† should be equal to -X.

Compute X†: Take the conjugate transpose.

Original X:
Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

Conjugate each element:
Row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1] (since 0 is real)
Row 3: [-2i, -1, i]

Now transpose, which swaps rows and columns. So the first column becomes the first row, etc.

So X† is:
Column 1: [-i, 1, -2i]
Column 2: [-1, 0, -1]
Column 3: [-2i, 1, i]

Wait, that's not the same as -X. Let's compute -X.

-X:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare with X†:

X† as a matrix:

First row: [-i, -1, -2i] → No, wait! When I transpose, the first row of X† is the first column of the conjugated X.

Wait, perhaps I should write X as a matrix with indices:

X:
Row 1: (0,0) = i, (0,1)=-1, (0,2)=2i
Row 2: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1
Row 3: (2,0)=2i, (2,1)=-1, (2,2)=-i

Conjugate each element:

X_conj:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now transpose, which swaps rows and columns. So the (i,j) element becomes (j,i).

So X† would be:

Row 1: (0,0) = conjugate of X(0,0) → -i, (0,1)=conjugate of X(1,0) → 1, (0,2)=conjugate of X(2,0) → -2i
So first row of X† is [-i, 1,
