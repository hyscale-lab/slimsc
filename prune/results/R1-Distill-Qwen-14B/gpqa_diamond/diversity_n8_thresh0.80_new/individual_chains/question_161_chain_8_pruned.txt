Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because that helps with electron microscopy by reducing scattering.

But even with the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering things like the compartment volume, pressure, and temperature.

Wait, mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So in a vacuum, the pressure is really low, so the mean free path is longer. That makes sense because fewer gas molecules mean less chance for collisions.

But then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It was λ1 before, now it's λ2. The temperature is the same, so that's not changing things. Hmm, why would λ change?

I remember that mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. Oh wait, but pressure is already accounted for in λ1. Since the compartment's pressure didn't change (because the vacuum pumps are still on, I assume), why is λ2 different?

Wait, maybe the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. Like, when the electrons are moving through the gas, they might cause more scattering or ionization. So perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or even pumped out more when the beam is on.

Wait another thought: if the electron beam is causing gas molecules to ionize or to have more collisions with the electrons, that could effectively increase the number of collisions the gas molecules undergo. Because now, the electrons are another source of scattering. So the gas molecules would collide more often with the electrons, which would reduce their mean free path.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path λ is calculated based on the gas's own collisions. Oh, but when the electrons are moving, their presence could cause additional scattering events for the gas. So the gas molecules would have a shorter mean free path because they're colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

Wait, but isn't the mean free path for the gas molecules calculated based on their interactions? So if the electrons are causing more scattering, that's like adding more 'obstacles' for the gas molecules. So the mean free path for the gas would be less than before. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Let me think again. The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules, P pressure, T temperature, and k Boltzmann's constant. So if the pressure remains the same and temperature is same, λ should stay the same. But here, when the electron beam is on, perhaps some other effect is happening.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be ionized or to have more energy. If the gas molecules are ionized, they might behave differently. Could that affect their mean free path? Hmm, ionized particles might have different collision cross-sections or maybe stick to surfaces more. Alternatively, if the gas is getting heated by the electron beam, but the question states the temperature remains the same.

Wait, but the sample compartment's temperature is same, so thermal expansion or movement shouldn't change. Hmm. Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the electrons themselves are moving through the gas. So the gas molecules would collide not only with each other but also with the electrons. So each gas molecule now has more chances to collide, hence a shorter mean free path.

So the mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels before a collision. If the electrons are causing more collisions, then λ would decrease. So λ2 < λ1. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C) λ2 < λ1.

So looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1 → No, because it's higher, which doesn't make sense if collisions are more frequent.

B) λ2 = λ1 → No, because Mike observed a change.

C) λ2
