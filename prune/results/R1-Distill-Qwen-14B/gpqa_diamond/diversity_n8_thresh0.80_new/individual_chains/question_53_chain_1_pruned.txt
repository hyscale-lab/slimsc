Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific peaks, like the carbonyl (C=O) around 1700 cm^-1. So that's a clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break down what each signal might be. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents will influence the aromatic protons. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic Hs would be as two sets of doublets or something. Wait, but di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. But the NMR has two aromatic signals. Hmm, maybe the ring has two different substituents leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Or perhaps the substituents are such that each has two equivalent Hs.

Wait, the NMR also shows two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically from double bonds, like in an ester's adjacent group. So maybe there's a vinyl group attached somewhere. For example, maybe a substituent is a vinyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring with an ester substituent and another group that has vinyl protons.

Then there are two signals for -CH3 groups, and no -CH2 groups. So the molecule must have two methyl groups but no methylene groups. That suggests maybe two -CH3 substituents attached somewhere, perhaps on an ester or another group.

Putting this together: the compound is a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups? Or maybe one ester group and another substituent that has a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, no, because the ester group might be part of a substituent. Let me think about possible structures.

Ester groups are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but wait no, esters are RCOOR'. So maybe the substituent is an ester group. For example, something like OMe attached to the ring, but that's an ether. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group, but that's a ketone. Wait, no, because it's an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is something like a vinyl ester. Like, if one of the substituents is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. So maybe the structure is benzene with an ester substituent and another substituent that has a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but that's an ester group attached to the ring. Alternatively, the substituent could be an acyloxy group, like OOCR. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent could be something like an aryl ester, but that's perhaps more complicated.

Wait, the NMR signals: two aromatic Hs. So the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic ring to have two sets of Hs. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two equivalent H
