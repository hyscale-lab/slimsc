Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that compound X (C11H12O) reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I have to figure out what Compound X was.

Wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a type of base, maybe a strong one. I think it's used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, it's commonly used as a base in the opening of epoxides, especially under certain conditions like acidic or basic. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is pretty high (403 K is about 130°C). Hmm, maybe it's an acid catalyzed reaction? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening via a different mechanism.

Wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a non-nucleophilic base, so maybe it's involved in deprotonation. But I'm more familiar with it being used in the opening of epoxides, perhaps in a conjugate addition. Oh, wait, wait! Oh right, when epoxides have substituents that can stabilize a carbocation, like adjacent to a carbonyl, the base can deprotonate and lead to ring-opening. Alternatively, with a strong base, maybe an elimination reaction occurs.

But the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening via a conjugate addition, which forms a diol or something else. Or maybe the reaction is something else, like a rearrangement.

Wait, the product's NMR shows certain signals. Let's look at the data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each. Those are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals
