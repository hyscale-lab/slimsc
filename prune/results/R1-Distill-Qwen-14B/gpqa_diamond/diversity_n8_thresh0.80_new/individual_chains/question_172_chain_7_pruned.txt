Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. The question is about effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

So, the problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the photosphere is in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the Boltzmann equation must be involved here, right?

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Oh wait, but the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, that ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1 maybe? Or wait, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice as much as that for star_2. So, let me denote the excitation ratio for star_1 as R1 = 2 * R2, where R is the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population or something like that.

But wait, the question doesn't specify whether the atoms are in their ground or excited state, but I think the ratio is given between the two states. So for star_1, R1 = 2, and for star_2, R2 = 1? Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe the question says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2. Hmm, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the excitation potential given is the energy difference between the two levels, ΔE. So for each star, the excitation ratio is R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Assuming that the g_upper/g_lower term is the same for both stars, because we're comparing the same transition in the same element. So the ratio R for each star depends on their temperatures.

So for star_1, R1 = A * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), where A is (g_upper/g_lower). For star_2, R2 = A * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2. Because in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So substituting those into the equation:

A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 A exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Oh wait, but wait, R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting, we get:

A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 A exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We can divide both sides by A (assuming A is same for both, which it is since same element and transition):

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) =
