Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, that facilitates this process.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure of that? Let's draw it. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, with a methyl group on the third carbon? Let me count.

Wait, the formula is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the parent chain is pentene, with the double bond starting at C1. The substituent is a methyl group on C3.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So for 3-methyl, it's on the third carbon. So yes, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the parent chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. And a methyl group is attached to C3. So the structure is:

Positions: 1   2   3       4   5
Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have five carbons in the chain, but the substituent is on C3. So yeah, that's correct.

But wait, the molecule is racemic. So it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But since the molecule is symmetric, or maybe not? Let me think. The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The double bond is at C1-C2, and the substituent is on C3, which is a CH(CH3) group. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Is there a plane of symmetry? Let me see. The molecule may not be symmetric because the double bond is at C1, and the substituent is on C3, which is a branch. So, the molecule has two enantiomers because the configuration at C3 is chiral.

Wait, but actually, for a molecule to have a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. Let's check C3. C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is double-bonded to C1, so it's CH2-CH2... no, wait, C2 is CH2. Wait, no, in CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the C2 is CH2, because the double bond is between C
