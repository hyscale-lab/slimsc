Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They provided the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the product, and we need to identify which of the four options is compound X.

Wait, but hold on. The reaction is between compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I think that's a base, maybe used for elimination reactions or for deprotonating something. Oh, right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes in the presence of an acid, but wait, maybe in this case it's used for an elimination. Or perhaps it's used in the acid-catalyzed opening of epoxides? Hmm, I might be getting that mixed up.

Wait, no, wait. Diazabicyclo compounds like this are commonly used as bases in elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism. So if compound X is an epoxide, reacting it with a strong base might lead to some opening. Or wait, but the product's NMR is provided as the theoretical spectrum. So perhaps compound X is the starting material, and after reaction, we get a product which shows these NMR signals.

Wait, no, wait again. The question says that compound X was subjected to a reaction with the base, resulting in a product whose NMR is given. So we have to figure out what X is such that when it's treated with this base, it forms the product with the given NMR.

Wait, but looking at the options, all the options are epoxides except perhaps D. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. So this would be an epoxide (oxirane) with a styryl group at position 2.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane has a substituent that's (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl). So that's like a propenyl group with a phenyl at position 1 and the oxirane at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane is substituted at position 2 with a methyl and at position 3 with a styryl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Hmm, that's similar to option A, but the substituents might be different. Wait, styryl is a vinyl benzene, so 2-styrylepoxide would have the styryl group attached to the epoxide oxygen at position 2.

Wait, but all the options are epoxides. So if X is an epoxide and after reaction with a base, perhaps it's undergoing ring-opening. Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so the product is the ring-opened compound.

Hmm, wait, but the reaction conditions are 403 K for a day. That's quite a high temperature and long time. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating a compound to form an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite: opening an epoxide.

Wait, but if the product is the result of an epoxide opening, then the starting material (compound X) would be an epoxide, and the product would be an diol or something else. But looking at the NMR data, I don't see any obvious OH groups in the H NMR. The H NMR doesn't show any broad peaks around 1-5 ppm, which would be typical for
