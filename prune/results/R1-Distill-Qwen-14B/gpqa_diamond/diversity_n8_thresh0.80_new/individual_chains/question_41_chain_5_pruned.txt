Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, but also towards the observer. Hmm, since the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. I'm a bit confused about the setup.

I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the speed of light observed in that medium. But how exactly? Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way velocities transform. Oh wait, but this is a glass medium moving, so perhaps it's more of a matter of relative motion affecting the observed speed.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary is c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is given by n = c / v_glass, where v_glass is the speed of light in the medium. So normally, without any motion, the speed would be c/n.

But now the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame?

I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is
