Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to an elimination of HBr from each Br, forming a double bond between the two carbons.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the NMR data might help. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense for an alkene maybe. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that's a region where vinyl protons usually show up. But wait, 4.79 is more like for something near an oxygen, maybe an ether or an epoxide. Or could it be the protons on the double bond? Wait, but if it's a diene, maybe the splitting is different.

Wait, but product 1 is formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I think I'm mixing up things. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. KOH in a high temperature probably leads to elimination, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantylene or something similar, but the exact structure might not matter right now.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): Maybe the methylene group adjacent to the double bond? Or perhaps an epoxide group? Wait, but epoxidation would require an oxidation step, which I don't think happened here. Alternatively, maybe these are the protons on the double bond. But in that case, a di-substituted double bond's protons would be around 5-5.5 ppm, so 4.79 seems a bit low. Unless it's a transannular structure or something.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but an epoxide formation? Wait, no, epoxide formation usually requires peracids or other oxidizing agents,
