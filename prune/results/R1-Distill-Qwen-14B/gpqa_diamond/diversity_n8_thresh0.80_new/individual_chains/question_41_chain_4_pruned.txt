Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through different media, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But wait, here the glass itself is moving. Oh right, that probably involves some relativity concepts because the medium is moving relative to the observer.

So, the setup: a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, but in the glass, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because in vacuum it's c, and when it enters a medium with index n, it slows down to c/n. So without any motion, the speed would be 1/n. But now the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when one frame is moving relative to another, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, in this case, the medium is moving, so perhaps the light's velocity in the medium is u, and the medium itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the observed velocity of the light would be (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(
