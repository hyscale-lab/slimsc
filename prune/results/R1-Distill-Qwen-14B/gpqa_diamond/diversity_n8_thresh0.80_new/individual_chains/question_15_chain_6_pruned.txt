Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The stars they orbit have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. The options give different probabilities, and I need to figure out which is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, more specifically, the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance, right?

Wait, I think the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to our line of sight. But since both planets are already detected via RV, which tells us their velocities, that gives information about their minimum masses and the size of their orbits.

Wait, the RV method gives us the mass of the planet (minimum, since we don't know the inclination) and the orbital period. But for transit probability, the main factor is the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The transit probability P is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else... Wait, I think the main formula for the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet^2), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's (R_planet / a_planet) * (some factor), but perhaps it's more accurate to model it as the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance?

Wait, no, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet^2), but when R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this simplifies to approximately (R_star / a_planet)Â² multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) squared, but I might be
