Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where the coding sequence of GADD45G is modified to include a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. So, they look into the sequence of the plus strand of their construct and find something wrong.

Hmm, the options given are A to D, and I need to determine which one is the issue.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag isn't correctly expressed. But wait, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. If the HA tag was wrong, perhaps the antibody wouldn't bind, but the initial issue is the expression level.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That could happen if there's a stop codon prematurely introduced, maybe a mutation in the sequence. But looking at the given construct, does it have a stop codon early on?

Option C: Lack of a linker sequence causing proteolysis. Proteolysis would mean the protein is being broken down. If there's no linker, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign, leading to degradation. For example, if the tag is at the N-terminus without a linker, maybe the cell's proteases are cutting it.

Option D: The tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the coding sequence, if the construct ends with UAA, maybe that's a stop. But in the provided plus strand sequence, the last part is ...GAGTGA3'. Let me look at that. Let's break it down: looking at the end, it's ...GAGTGA. So that's the triplet before the end. GAG is a codon for glutamic acid, and then TGA is a stop codon. Wait, no, because the sequence is 5' to 3', so the reading frame matters.

Wait, the way the question presents the plus strand is 5' to 3', so when transcribed into mRNA, it would be complementary. But wait, the coding sequence is written as plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA except T instead of U. So the last codon would be TGA in the mRNA sequence, which is a stop codon. So, that would mean that the construct has a stop codon at the end, which is normal. So, the translation wouldn't stop early if the gene ends with TGA.

Wait, but wait a second. If the construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus, then the HA sequence is added before the GADD45G sequence. So the coding region starts with the HA tag, then the GADD45G.

Looking at the given sequence, the start is 5' ATG ... . ATG is the start codon, which is correct. The HA tag is a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA or something. But the question says they introduced the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus.

Wait, the way the construct is written, it's the coding sequence for GADD45G with the HA tag added. So the coding sequence should start with ATG, followed by the HA sequence, then the GADD45G coding. So if the HA tag's coding sequence was introduced correctly, it should be part of the initial part of the ORF.

But wait, in the given sequence, let me check: The plus strand starts with ATG, then TAC, which is tyrosine. The HA tag sequence would be something like ATG (start), then the HA sequence codons, then the rest of GADD45G.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), etc. If the HA tag's coding sequence was supposed to be added before GADD45G, then the start of the construct should be the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G start.

Wait, maybe the construct was designed to include the HA tag as a fusion, so the mRNA will be HA followed by GADD45G. But looking at the sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is correct for start. The next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. So that would be the first amino acid of the HA tag.

Wait, but the HA tag is usually short, like 10 amino acids. So let's see: the HA tag is from the influenza virus, and its coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCT GAA AGA... etc. Wait, maybe the given construct starts correctly with the HA tag. But looking at the given sequence, perhaps there's a problem.

Wait, the issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So the problem is that the construct isn't being translated properly. Looking at the options, which one would cause no expression.

Option B: the ribosome terminated early. That would require a stop codon upstream, but the given sequence's last part is ...GAG TGA, so the mRNA would have ...GAG UGA. Wait, the last part of the plus strand is ...GAGTGA3', so in mRNA, it would be ...GAGUAG, but wait, no, because mRNA is complementary to the template strand. Wait, the plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So in the plus strand, the sequence is 5' ...GAGTGA3'. So the last codon on the plus strand would be TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the construct's ORF ends with TGA, which is correct as it's the end of the coding sequence. So the ribosome would stop there normally, unless there's an in-frame stop codon earlier.

But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed. So perhaps the construct includes an early stop codon, but looking at the given sequence, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the reading frame. The construct is supposed to be in frame with the HA tag and GADD45G. If there's a frameshift, the ORF would be messed up, leading to a premature stop.

Looking at the given sequence, does it have any in-frame stop codons before the end? Let me check.

The sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAA (E), GAA (E), etc. Let me scan through for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons.

Wait, in the plus strand, the mRNA will have T for U. So the codons are in triplets, let's divide the sequence into triplets to see.

The sequence is: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA ... etc.

Wait, I can see that after some time, the sequence has TGA as a codon. Let me check the earlier part.

Wait, let me count:

Start: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA GAA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA...

So the last codon before TGA is GCT (A), then TGA (stop). So there's no stop before that.

Wait, but perhaps another stop earlier. Let's see:

Looking through the codons:

ATG (start)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GTT (V)
CCA (P)
GAA (E)
GAA (E)
GTC (V)
GCG (A)
GCC (A)
AGG (R)
ACA (T)
CAG (Q)
TTC (F)
CGG (R)
AAA (K)
GCA (A)
CAG (Q)
CCA (P)
GGT (G)
GCA (A)
GGG (G)
GAA (E)
AGC (S)
GCT (A)
GCA (A)
TGA (stop)

Wait, any TAA or TAG in the codons? Let me see:

The codons are:

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCA
4. TAC
5. GAT
6. GTT
7. CCA
8. GAA
9. GAA
10. GTC
11. GCG
12. GCC
13. AGG
14. ACA
15. CAG
16. TTC
17. CGG
18. AAA
19. GCA
20. CAG
21. CCA
22. GGT
23. GCA
24. GGG
25. GAA
26. AGC
27. GCT
28. GCA
29. TGA

No other TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the earlier positions. So the only stop is at the end.

So if that's the case, the translation shouldn't terminate early. Then why isn't the protein being expressed?

Looking at the options again.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. A linker might be necessary to prevent the protein from being recognized and degraded by proteases. For example, if the HA tag is placed directly before the GADD45G without a linker, the cell might recognize it as a foreign or misfolded protein and degrade it via proteasomes. Without a linker, maybe the two domains are not compatible, leading to improper folding or rapid degradation.

Alternatively, maybe the construct is not properly expressed because of a lack of a Kozak sequence or proper promoter elements. But the question says that the expression is tested, so perhaps the construct is not being properly translated.

Wait, the question says they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. So the construct likely has a selection marker (like neo) under a promoter. But the problem is that the GADD45G-HA isn't expressed.

Wait, another thought: the plasmid's origin of replication or the expression cassette might not be compatible with CHO cells. But the question says they used Lipofectamine, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Hmm, another angle: the plus strand sequence ends with TGA, but in the mRNA, the stop codon is at the end. So the protein should be correctly synthesized. But perhaps the issue is that the HA tag isn't correctly added because the sequence is messed up.

Wait, option A is about a missense mutation in the HA determinant. If the HA sequence is wrong, the antibody wouldn't bind, but the expression level is the problem. If the HA sequence has a mutation, perhaps the reading frame is messed up, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, looking at the initial part of the plus strand: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the HA tag is supposed to start with, say, ATG followed by some amino acids. Let me think about the HA peptide. The HA tag is from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The coding sequence for that would be:

YPYDVPDYA

Breaking that down into codons:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCA
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

Wait, but sometimes the HA tag can be longer or have variations. So the initial part of the plus strand is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which would correspond to the start codon followed by Y, P, Y, D, V, etc. So that seems correct. So option A would suggest a mutation in the HA tag, which might cause the protein to not be recognized, but the question is about expression, not detection.

But the problem is the lack of overexpression. If the HA tag was messed up, perhaps the construct isn't expressed because of a frameshift or incorrect reading frame. Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG and follows correct reading frame.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's stop codon is missing, causing the ribosome to read through into the GADD45G sequence. But that doesn't make sense because the HA is N-terminal, so the GADD45G should follow.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that a stop codon is present in the HA tag's sequence, causing the translation to terminate early. For example, if within the HA tag, a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon exists. Let's check.

Looking at the first few codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (V)
7. CCA (P)
8. GAA (E)
9. GAA (E)
10. GTC (V)
...

So the first 10 codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAA, GAA, GTC.

Wait, so the fifth codon is GAT (Asp), sixth GTT (Val), etc. No TGA or other stop codons in the first 10.

But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be shorter than that. Oh, wait, perhaps the HA tag is only 8 amino acids. Let me think: YPYDVPDYA is 9 amino acids (I think). So the coding sequence for that is 9 codons after the start.

Looking at the first 9 codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (V)
7. CCA (P)
8. GAA (E)
9. GAA (E)

So the HA tag would be Y P Y D V P E E? Hmm, that doesn't make sense, because the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCT GAA AGA ... something like that. Wait, maybe the given sequence doesn't have the correct HA tag.

Wait, but the question says that they introduced the sequence for the HA determinant. So perhaps the HA coding was added incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the reading frame when the HA was added. For example, if the HA sequence was inserted into the construct in the wrong frame, it would cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and a premature stop codon.

Looking at the given plus strand, the sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, etc. So the initial frame is correct. So I don't see a frameshift.

Wait, but what if the HA tag's coding sequence was not correctly added, perhaps inserting an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift. But the given sequence doesn't show any signs of frame shift because all the codons are in triplets.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the HA tag wasn't added, and the GADD45G is being expressed correctly. But the user intended to overexpress the HA-tagged GADD45G, but perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be unstable. For instance, if the HA tag is at the N-terminus and is recognized by the cell's proteases, leading to degradation.

Wait, that would align with option C: the lack of a linker causing proteolysis. So the HA tag is right next to the GADD45G, and without a linker, the protein might be recognized as foreign, leading to rapid degradation. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, leading to the cell's quality control mechanisms degrading it.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion disrupted the reading frame. But I don't see any signs of that in the sequence.

Wait another thought: maybe the HA tag is present, but the start codon is correct, but the HA tag is followed by a stop codon early, which is not the case.

Another possibility: the expression vector doesn't have a suitable promoter for the CHO cells. But the question says they used Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance, so perhaps the promoter is working.

Another angle: the vector might not have the correct RBS (ribosome binding site). Without a proper RBS, the mRNA might not be efficiently translated, leading to low expression. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Looking back at the options, option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, the construct is in the mouse, so the tRNAs would be mouse's. But UAA is a stop codon recognized by all cells. So that's probably not the issue.

Wait, the construct's coding sequence is in the plus strand, which is the same as mRNA except T->U. The last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the translation should stop there normally.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is not followed by the correct start codon for GADD45G. But the initial ATG is the start, so the HA is part of the same ORF.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is missing, so the GADD45G isn't expressed. But the user modified the construct to add the HA, so that's unlikely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's presence causes the ribosome to terminate early because of a stop codon within the HA sequence. Let me check.

Looking at the HA sequence in the construct: the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. The codons would be:

ATG (start)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GTT (V)
GCT (A)
TCT (S)
GAA (E)
GAA (E)
GTA (V)
...

Wait, maybe that's not matching with the given sequence. Let me compare.

The given sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which is Y P Y D V... Wait, in the HA tag, after the initial YPYD, it's VP. So the HA tag would continue after D with V (GTG?), but in the given sequence, after D (GAT) comes GTT (Val), then CCA (P), then GAA (E), etc. So the HA tag would be Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), E (GAA), E (GAA), etc. Wait, that's 9 amino acids: Y-P-Y-D-V-P-E-E... Wait, that's 8? Or maybe I'm counting wrong.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA: that's Y (1), P (2), Y (3), D (4), V (5), P (6), D (7), Y (8), A (9). So the coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT GCT TCT GAA AGA GTC ... etc. But in the given construct, the part after GTT is CCA (P), GAA (E), GAA (E), GTC (V)... So the HA tag as per the given construct is Y-P-Y-D-V-P-E-E-V... which is longer than the standard HA tag, perhaps. So maybe the HA tag's coding sequence was extended, leading to an incorrect sequence.

But wait, the given construct's HA sequence may have a premature stop codon. Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Wait, the HA coding is in the beginning. Let me check the first 10 codons:

ATG (1)
TAC (2)
CCA (3)
TAC (4)
GAT (5)
GTT (6)
CCA (7)
GAA (8)
GAA (9)
GTC (10) (V)

So, the 8th codon is GAA (E), 9th GAA (E), 10th GTC (V). So no stop codons in the first 10. So the HA is correctly part of the ORF, and the GADD45G follows.

If that's the case, why isn't the protein expressed? It's puzzling.

Looking back at the options, option B suggests the ribosome terminated early because of a premature stop codon. But according to the given sequence, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Option C: lack of a linker causing proteolysis. That seems possible. Without a linker, the HA tag might be too close to the GADD45G, leading the cell to recognize the fusion protein as a foreign antigen and degrade it via the proteasome. Proteins with multiple domains that aren't properly folded or are recognized as foreign can be targets for the cell's quality control.

Another possibility is that the HA tag's presence introduces a cryptic signal for secretion or degradation. Some tags can interfere with proper protein folding or localization, leading to lower expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion introduced a stop codon in the reading frame of the GADD45G gene. But from the sequence, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag is followed by a stop codon in the GADD45G sequence, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid was not correctly designed. For example, the construct might have the HA sequence in the wrong orientation, leading to a reverse ORF. But in that case, the ATG would be in the middle of the sequence, which doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, looking at the sequence again, the very end is ...GAGTGA3'. So in the mRNA, that's ...GAG UGA. UGA is a stop codon, so the last codon is UGA, meaning the protein ends there.

So, everything seems correct, except that the HA tag might not have a proper linker.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag might have a signal peptide or a sequence that targets it to the ER, but if the GADD45G is cytoplasmic, that could cause issues. But again, this isn't among the options.

The options are A to D, so perhaps the correct answer is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis.

Because if the HA tag is directly attached to GADD45G without a linker, the protein might be recognized as a fusion and targeted for degradation. Linkers are often used to separate the tag from the target protein to avoid such issues. So without a linker, the HA tag might cause the protein to be unstable, leading to low expression levels.


The question involves creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein, with a focus on its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G fused with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided sequence of the plus strand of the construct is analyzed to identify the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter its sequence, potentially affecting antibody binding. However, the question focuses on the lack of protein expression, not detection. The sequence provided appears to start correctly with the HA tag (ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G...), and no obvious mutations are evident. This option does not explain the lack of expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Premature termination would require an in-frame stop codon upstream of the expected end. The sequence shows that the ribosome translates the full ORF, ending with the stop codon TGA at the very end. No premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) are present in the earlier part of the sequence. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Without a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, the fusion protein may be recognized as foreign or misfolded by the cell's proteolytic machinery, leading to rapid degradation. This would result in low expression levels of the protein, aligning with the observed issue. Proteins with foreign tags or improper folding are often targeted for proteolysis, and linkers are commonly used to prevent such recognition.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   UAA is a valid stop codon recognized by all cells, including mouse cells. The construct ends with TGA (stop codon), and the absence of a specific tRNA for UAA is irrelevant in this context. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the lack of a linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G is causing proteolysis of the nascent protein. Without a linker, the fusion protein may be recognized as foreign or misfolded, leading to its degradation and preventing proper expression.

**Answer: C**
