Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question about a ligand-receptor pair and some mouse genetics stuff. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about why there's no green signal when they look at the mouse offspring under the confocal microscope. The green signal is probably from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So why wouldn't it show up?

Let me try to recap the setup. They created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two coding regions in one construct. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. So the stop cassettes would prevent the downstream genes from being expressed unless Cre is present to excise the stop. So, when Cre is introduced, it can delete the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

They used a bicistronic vector, so the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same transcript but are under different promoters or something? Wait, no. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Oh right, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand. So the mRNA has CBA-driven ligand, then IRES, then receptor.

But the stop cassettes complicate this. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between, so without Cre, the mCherry wouldn't be expressed because the stop would prevent it. Same with the receptor and eGFP. So in the vector, the ligand has a stop after it, and the receptor has a stop before eGFP.

Wait, no: ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So perhaps the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry? Or maybe the ligand is expressed, then the stop is in the way, and mCherry isn't
