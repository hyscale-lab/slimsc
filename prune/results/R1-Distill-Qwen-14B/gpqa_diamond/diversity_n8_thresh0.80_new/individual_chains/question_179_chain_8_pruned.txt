Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are statements about these matrices, and I need to choose the correct one.

Option A says that there's a vector where when you multiply it by e^X, the norm changes. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator (like e^-iHt) should be unitary because it preserves the norm of the state vector. So, the exponential of a matrix should be unitary if X is Hermitian, right? But wait, X is given here. Let me check if X is Hermitian.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

To check if X is Hermitian, X should equal X† (dagger, conjugate transpose). Let's compute X's conjugate transpose.

X† would have first column as [ -i, 1, -2i ] because the first row of X is [i, -1, 2i], and transposed and conjugated. Let's compare with X's columns.

Wait, let's transpose X first. The transpose of X is:

Row 1: i, 1, 2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: 2i, 1, -i

Then the conjugate would
