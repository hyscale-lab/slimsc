Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy problems, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that reaction conditions are important here. Red phosphorus and HI... Oh right! That's the reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, right? Or is that something else? Or wait, maybe that's for the reduction of nitriles. Hmm. Let me think. Oh wait, no, I think that when nitriles are treated with HI and red phosphorus, they undergo hydrolysis to form an amine. Because the reaction conditions are for the Stephen reduction, but wait, no, Stephen uses H2S and HgSO4. Oh wait, I think that when you have a nitrile and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis reaction to form an amine. So, the nitrile group (C≡N) would convert to an amine (CH2NH2 or something similar, depending on substitution). But wait, alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Wait, which condition leads to which product?

Wait, I think the reaction of nitriles with HI and red phosphorus is called the Rosenmund reduction, which reduces the nitrile to an amine. Or is that with hydrogen and a catalyst? No, Rosenmund uses H2 and a poisoned catalyst to stop at the amine. Oh, wait, no, the reaction of nitrile with HI and red phosphorus gives a primary amine. So the nitrile group R-C≡N becomes R-CH2-NH2. Or wait, maybe it's R-CH2-NH2? Or maybe R-NH-CH2 something? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis using H3O+ and heat, which would give a carboxylic acid, but that's without red phosphorus and HI. So when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's more likely a different reaction pathway.

Wait, or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The reaction of nitriles with HI and red phosphorus is the hydrolysis to an amine. So the nitrile becomes a primary amine. So if the starting material is, say, R-C≡N, after reaction, it would be R-CH2-NH2. But wait, wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is reduced to an amine via this method. So the nitrile group becomes a methylamine group.

Now, looking at the problem, the product we're supposed to find is after this reaction. So first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Because once I know what X is, then I can apply the reaction to find the product.

So, let's look at the spectroscopic data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data are given.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, 1450 cm-1.

Hmm. The IR peaks can help identify functional groups. Let's parse them.

- 3400–2500: This broad region usually indicates an -OH group (stretching) or possibly an amine N-H stretch. But wait, the broadness suggests it's an -OH group, maybe a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have broad O-H stretches, but carboxylic acids are usually broader. Alternatively, if it's an amine, the N-H would be around 3300-3500, maybe a broad peak. The 3400–2500 could also suggest an -NH stretch, but I'm not certain.

- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So, either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or maybe an amide. The exact position can help narrow it down. For example, carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit lower or higher depending on substitution. Esters are around 1720-1740. So 1720 suggests either ester or maybe a ketone, but more likely an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very broad, which is consistent with the 3400–2500 region. So, if the compound has both a carbonyl and a broad O-H, that points to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the IR data, what are the other peaks? 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be C=C stretching vibrations, possibly from an aromatic ring. So, if the compound has an aromatic ring, which is indicated by the NMR's multiplet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but another thing: the 1720 cm-1 peak could also be an ester. Because esters have strong C=O stretches around 1720-1740. So if the compound has an ester group, that would explain that. But then the 3400-2500 region would need to be something else.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the 3400-2500 is an N-H stretch, so maybe an amine. Then, the 1720 would be an ester or other carbonyl. But the other peaks would also have to fit.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data might help clarify.

The 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm suggests an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is broad due to hydrogen bonding.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene. For example, two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggests that the aromatic protons are in a para arrangement. So like a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents at opposite positions. Or maybe a single substituent with two equivalent protons on adjacent carbons—no, wait, no, because each doublet integrates 2H. So for a para-substituted benzene, you usually have two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that fits.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a CH next to an ester or carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Maybe part of a CH2 group, perhaps attached to another CH or something.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. That's a typical methyl group attached to something, like a CH2. Wait, no, a doublet with 3H would be a methyl attached to a CH, because the CH would split the methyl into a doublet. So like CH2-C(CH3)2? Or perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, which is a typical terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests:

- A para-substituted benzene ring (the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets).

- A substituent on the benzene that leads to the other groups.

The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid group, but wait, looking back at the IR, the 1720 might be a carbonyl of a carboxylic acid. However, wait, the IR also shows 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the region for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

So, the structure could be a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH. So, the substituent is likely a -COOH group. So the benzene has a -COOH substituent. Let's see.

But then, what about the other groups in the NMR?

Looking again:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH group attached to an ester or carbonyl. For example, a CH2CH2COOH? Or perhaps a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl group. Let's think: perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3)2 or something.

Wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest an ethyl group. The 0.9 triplet is a terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2 connected to a benzene with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that is a CH2COOH, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, let's try to figure this out.

The H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs): This is likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): So, the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. So, the substituent is at one position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So, the substituent is either a substituent that makes the ring para-substituted. Wait, but if the substituent is a -COOH group, which is a meta director, but that's about substitution during the synthesis, not the structure itself. Anyway, the NMR shows that the substitution is para.

So, the benzene has a substituent at, say, position 4 (para), which is something like -COOH. But then, there's another substituent attached to the benzene? Or is the substituent itself a group that connects to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a side chain. For example, the benzene has a substituent that is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH and then to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, looking at the NMR:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to that CH.

- The 1.4 (d, 3H): That's a methyl group attached to a CH. So, the structure could be something like:

benzene-CO-O-R or benzene-CO-R, where R is a substituent.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR suggests a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but sometimes it can be higher depending on substitution. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720-1740.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is present, which is a strong peak. So, if the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group, perhaps as a ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, but the presence of the broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, because the O-H stretch is very broad. So, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group.

But wait, then the NMR would have a carbonyl as part of the COOH group. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, but according to the NMR, the substituent must have a CH2CH3 group (the 0.9 ppm triplet, 3H) and a CH group (the 2.9 ppm triplet, 1H), and a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H).

So perhaps the substit
