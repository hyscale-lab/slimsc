Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x <1 or x>3. So all are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So the wave function ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the probability density is |ψ|^2, which is real.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is -0.5.

The absolute square is |ψ|^2 = A² + B². Because when you square a complex number (a + ib), the modulus squared is a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function has to be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

Wait, but the problem says when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region, or perhaps the wave function is only defined between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the given wave function doesn't have a form that's zero at x=1 and x=3. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Let's compute that.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So, a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1)=0.25*2=0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the probability density over the region where the particle exists (between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\)) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i.
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx\).  
   Using the substitution \(u = 1 + x\), the integral becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\).  
   This is straightforward:
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
