Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a large number of identical systems—10,000 of them. Each system has a particle that behaves under the same conditions. The particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the positions of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because when you square the absolute value of the wave function, you get the probability density, and the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ is a complex function. To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, since the particle isn't found elsewhere.

Wait, but wait. The wave function is given, but the region where the particle exists is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region? Or perhaps, in the region x<1 or x>3, the wave function is zero. Because the particle was never found there, so the probability is zero outside that interval.

But the given wave function is only valid where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit different. The wave function is given as that expression in a part
