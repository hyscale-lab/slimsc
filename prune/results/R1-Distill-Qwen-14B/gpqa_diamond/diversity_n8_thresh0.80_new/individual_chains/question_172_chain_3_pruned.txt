Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation is probably involved. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The formula I remember is something like (n_i/n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the problem is about the ratio of excited atoms in two stars. So maybe we can model the ratio of the populations in each star.

Let me denote the energy levels. For each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or another state) would depend on the temperature. Wait, no, the problem says the same energy levels are being compared in both stars, so the energy difference ΔE is the same for both, 1.38e-23 J.

So for star 1, the excitation level is higher. Let's say n1 is the number of excited atoms in star 1, and n2 in star 2. Wait, wait, the question says the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, wait. Oh, more precisely, "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the ratio is n1/n2 = 2.

But the problem doesn't specify if the statistical weights are the same for both. Oh, I think I need to assume that the two energy levels have the same statistical weight, otherwise the ratio might get complicated. So I'll proceed under that assumption, since the problem doesn't provide any other details.

So, for each star, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio would be n1 = (g) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and for star_2, n2 = (g) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). Since the statistical weights g are the same for both stars, they cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio n1/n2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Oh wait, wait. Let me compute that carefully. The exponent would be [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)).

So n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But the problem states that n1/n2 is 2. So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )
