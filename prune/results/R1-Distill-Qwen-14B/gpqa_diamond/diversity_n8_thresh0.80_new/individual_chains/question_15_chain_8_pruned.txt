Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, transits, rightâ€”when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The researchers want to observe the planet that's more likely to transit because they have limited time. 

Alright, both planets are already detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they match in size. Oh, interesting. So even though one is more massive, their sizes are the same. 

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (some function of the inclination). But wait, for transit probability, the key factors are the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the orbital distance. Oh, right, the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star) squared, but also depends on the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the main factor for the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. More precisely, the probability is approximately (R_*/ a)
