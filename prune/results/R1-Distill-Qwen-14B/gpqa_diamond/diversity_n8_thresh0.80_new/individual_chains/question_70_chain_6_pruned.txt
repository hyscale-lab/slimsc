Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Hmm, okay. I remember that molecular symmetry involves looking at the point group of a molecule, which is determined by the highest symmetry elements present. So each molecule has certain symmetry elements like axes, planes, centers, etc., and they form a point group.

Let me go through each reaction step by step to figure out what compounds A, B, C, D, E, etc., are. Then, I can determine the structure of E and its symmetry.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think what reacts in such a way. 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8. Like maybe a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. For example, if A is iron (Fe) and B is sulfur dioxide (SO2), but wait, sulfur hexafluoride maybe? Or perhaps another gas.

Wait, when A is a solid and B is a gas, the product is bright red. Bright red is a clue. Maybe product C is a metal hexafluoride? Or perhaps another compound. Alternatively, I've heard that some sulfates or other compounds can be bright red, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe product C is a sulfide? Or perhaps something else. Another approach: when a metal reacts with a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, perhaps in a high ratio. For example, Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but that's not red. What about when a metal reacts with S (but S is a solid, not a gas). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is copper (Cu) and B is sulfur dioxide (SO2). But how does that reaction go? Cu reacts with SO2? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, another reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But NaCl is white, not red. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal, and B is another element. Wait, another red compound I know is lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe solid A is carbon (C), and B is oxygen (O2). But carbon reacting with O2 would form CO or CO2, but that's not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, maybe the product C is a nitride? But I'm not sure if any nitrides are bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. For example, MnO2 is dark brown, not red. Or perhaps vanadium compounds, but I'm not recalling a bright red one.

Wait, here's another angle: the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C also reacts with water to produce A, and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

So, when C is reacted with water, it produces A (the original solid), and two acids. One strong, one weak. So perhaps the reaction is something like C reacting with H2O to give A, plus H+ (from F) and another acid (G). 

If F is a strong acid, it could be like HCl, H2SO4, etc. G is a weak acid, like acetic acid or something similar.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal sulfide. Suppose when C (metal sulfide) reacts with water, it produces the metal hydroxide, H2S (a weak acid), but wait, H2S is a weak acid but it's a gas. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a salt hydrolysis. 

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide, reacting with water would produce the metal hydroxide and possibly another acid. Hmm, but metal hydroxides are usually bases, not acids. Unless it's a non-metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate or another salt, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or carbide.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction more. C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio? Wait, the question says that when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E. So the reaction is C + 2 D → E.

E is extremely hazardous. So what gas D reacts with C to form something dangerous? For example, if D is chlorine gas (Cl2), then reaction with C might produce something like a chloride. But E is produced from C and D, which is a gas.

Wait, considering that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or something like phosgene? No, perhaps more likely, E is a highly toxic gas, for example, HCN or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle:
