Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I know that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is composed of 3 protons and 4 neutrons (Li-7). But if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. That makes it a helium isotope, but no, wait, lithium has 3 protons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I'll need the mass of this nucleus. The rest mass energy (m*c²) is typically given for such particles. I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), but wait, each u is about 1.660539e-27 kg. But maybe I should look it up. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the mass of a proton is about 1.67e-27 kg, and a neutron is about 1.675e-27 kg. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, let me calculate that. Each proton is about 1.6726219e-27 kg, and a neutron is about 1.6749274e-27 kg. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 3*(1.6726219e-27) + 3*(1.6749274e-27). Let me compute that.

3*(proton mass) = 3 * 1.6726219e-27 ≈ 5.0178657e-27 kg
3*(neutron mass) = 3 * 1.6749274e-27 ≈ 5.0247822e-27 kg
Total mass m = 5.0178657e-27 +5.0247822e-27 ≈ 10.042648e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum because of the binding energy (mass defect). But I think in this problem, they might expect me to use the rest mass as just the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 nucleus from a table. I might need to recall that the exact mass isn't necessary if I can find a formula that uses the mass number A and charge Z.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the necessary data implicitly. Let me think.

The energy of the nucleus in the collider is given by the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, but in relativistic terms, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. Wait, no, the total energy is gamma * m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². But in colliders, the energy referred to is usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes the total energy is given, including rest mass. Hmm, I need to be careful.

Wait, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So, I think they are asking for the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. Because in particle accelerators, the energy is often the kinetic energy plus the rest mass. Or wait, the total energy (gamma * m c²) is the sum. So I think the question is asking for the total energy, including rest mass, because when they talk about the energy of the collider, it's usually the total energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the kinetic energy K is being calculated, and the total energy is K + m c². So perhaps I should calculate either depending on what the question is asking. Let me re-read the question.

It says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain energy. In the context of colliders, the energy typically refers to the kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes in particle physics, the
