Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Let me confirm that: M1V1 = M2V2. 0.05 M *20 = M2 *40 → M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 1/4 *0.05 = 0.0125? Wait wait, wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 20 *0.05 = 1 mmol. Diluted to 40 cm³, so concentration is 1 mmol /40 cm³ =0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume at equivalence point would be (moles NaOH)/(0.1 M) = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question isn't about the volume needed; it's about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So 25% of the way to equivalence point. That means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So 0.001 moles *0.25 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Now, let's think about the solution at 25% titration. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 0.25 *0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH will be 0.00075, and moles of CH3COO^- will be 0.00025.

The total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added. Wait, but the question doesn't specify the volume of NaOH used at 25% titration. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the 25% refers to the fraction of the equivalence point volume. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added (since 0.001 moles /0.1 M NaOH is 10 cm³). So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So the total volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5
