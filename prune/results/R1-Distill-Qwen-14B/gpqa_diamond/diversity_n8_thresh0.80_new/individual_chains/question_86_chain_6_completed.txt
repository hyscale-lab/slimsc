Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products from both reactions are the same: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the first reaction gives (R) and the second gives (S). Let me re-read the question.

Wait, no. The question states: A + LiBH4 + H+ gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and B + BH3 + H+ gives (S)-4-ethyl.... So, two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, leading to enantiomers? Hmm.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. BH3 is used in the formation of alkenes from ketones via hydroboration, but maybe in this context it's also used for reduction? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, LiBH4 is typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, right? And BH3 is involved in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which is used to add boron to alkenes in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is a different compound.

Wait, no, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure—pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, but the starting materials are being treated with LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the starting materials are something that can be reduced to form this cyclic ketone?

Wait, wait a minute, maybe it's the other way around. The starting materials are being converted into this cyclic ketone via reduction. Let me think about the reactions. Oh wait, no—LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so maybe the starting materials are carbonyl compounds being reduced.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would typically reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, not form a ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters or something that upon reduction form the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, form the given product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketones, and the reaction is not a reduction but something else. But LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or amides. Let me think. Wait, if the product is a cyclic ketone, then maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Because reducing a lactone would give a diol, but that's not matching the product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to look at the product structure. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 2-one indicates a ketone at position 2. So the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol? Or wait, maybe it's the result of a reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, if the starting material is an ester group that, upon reduction, becomes a ketone. But how?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but usually doesn't reduce esters to ketones. Wait, no. Let me recall: LiAlH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but LiBH4 is a milder reagent. Oh, wait, no, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but perhaps not as effectively as LiAlH4. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketones, but that doesn't make sense because the product is also a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions. So, the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R) product. The second is B + BH3 + H+ → (S) product.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Wait, LiBH4 is a source of BH4−, while BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions. Wait, but in some cases, BH3 is used in the presence of a catalyst, like in the reduction of esters or amides.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents are reducing them to ketones. Let me think: an ester RCOOR' upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 might form RCH2OH and R'OH, but that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. For example, if A and B are esters such as gamma or delta lactones. When reduced, they would form diols, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves, but that can't be because the products are also ketones. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketals or other protecting groups that upon reduction form the ketone. Or maybe they're secondary alcohols that are oxidized to ketones. But the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3, which are reducing agents, not oxidizing.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are not reductions but something else. Oh wait! Wait, wait a minute, perhaps the reducing agents are being used in a different context. For example, in the reduction of epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening them. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the product structure again. The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with an oxygen. The substituents are ethyl at position 4 and a ketone at position 2.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reductants are opening them. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketones, but that doesn't seem to make sense because the product is a ketone.

Wait, another approach: the two reactions produce enantiomers. The first reaction gives (R), the second gives (S). So, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration.

Wait, but in that case, the starting materials (A and B) would have to have different configurations, leading to different products. So, looking at the options, the starting materials are different enantiomers, perhaps.

Looking at the options provided:

Options A and B have A and B as the same compound. Options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers.

So, if A and B are different, then their reaction with different reducing agents would lead to different products (R and S), perhaps.

Now, the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. Are they different in terms of how they affect the stereochemistry?

Wait, LiBH4 is a hydride donor that typically provides the hydride from the less substituted boron in hydroboration, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this case, the reactions are reductions. Wait, perhaps in the case of ketones, the reduction would not change the configuration because ketones are planar.

Wait, but if the starting material has a chiral center, then the reduction could lead to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, no, because ketones are trigonal planar; reducing a ketone would give a secondary alcohol which would have a new chiral center. So, the configuration of that alcohol would depend on the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, which is a planar structure, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester with a chiral center, then upon reduction, the configuration might be retained or inverted.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents are converting them into ketones. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then upon reduction, it becomes RCH2OH and R'OH, but that would form an alcohol, not a ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal. But the product is a ketone, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals, and upon reduction, they form the ketone. But that doesn't make sense either because reducing a hemiacetal would break the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with an additional substituent, and the reducing agents are removing or adding something to form the product.

Wait, I'm really not getting this. Maybe I should think about the reactions' mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to their corresponding alcohols. For example, a ketone R2C=O would become R2CH(OH) after reduction.

But in this problem, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a more oxidized group, such as an ester, which upon reduction forms the ketone.

Wait, but how? Let's think: An ester, RCOOR', when reduced with LiBH4, usually becomes RCH2OH and R'OH. That would produce an alcohol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are amides. But again, reducing an amide typically gives a primary amine, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a reduction of a nitrile. But that would form an amine.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them to form diols, which then dehydrate to form the ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, which could have been formed from the reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone. If you have a lactone (cyclic ester), reducing it would break the ring. For example, a five-membered lactone would reduce to a diol, but that wouldn't give a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides that, upon ring-opening with a reducing agent, form the ketone. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a neighboring oxygen, and the reduction leads to a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the stereoselectivity. The product has (R) and (S) configurations, which suggests that the starting material has a chiral center that influences the product.

So, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a chiral center, and upon treatment with LiBH4 or BH3, it forms the corresponding ketone with the opposite configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism. Maybe the reagents add in different ways, leading to different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents open them in different ways, leading to different configurations.

Another angle: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, BH3 is usually used in hydroboration reactions, which involve the addition of boron to alkenes, not reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is used to reduce esters to alcohols, but maybe in certain conditions, it can do something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketals, and the reagents are cleaving them. For example, if a ketal is treated with an acid, it would hydrolyze back to a ketone. But LiBH4 is a reducing agent, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When epoxides are treated with a reducing agent, perhaps they undergo ring-opening via a hydride attack. But the hydride would attack the less substituted oxygen, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think. If the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agent (like BH3) donates a hydride, opening the epoxide to form an alcohol.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be an alcohol, not a ketone. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers, and the reagents are used in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma or delta lactones (cyclic esters). When reduced, the ester groups are converted into alcohols, forming a diol. But that again doesn't produce a ketone.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look at the options provided.

The options give A and B as either the same compound or different. The product in both cases is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but with opposite configurations (R and S).

So, perhaps A and B are different in their configuration, leading to the different R and S products.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

B) Both (R).

C) A is S, B is R.

D) A is R, B is S.

So, the starting materials are either the same (A and B same) or different (C and D).

The key is to figure out whether the same starting material would give the same product or different products when treated with different reagents.

Wait, but the products are enantiomers. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, but the reaction is a reduction. So, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product configuration.

Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, and the product is also a ketone, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the starting materials are something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ketone. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', upon reduction, it becomes RCH2OH and R'OH. But that would give an alcohol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. For example, an ester with a ketone group adjacent. When reduced, it could form a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps it's formed via a ring-opening reaction of a cyclic ester (lactone) followed by a reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are gamma-butyrolactones or similar. When treated with a reducing agent, the lactone ring opens, and perhaps a ketone is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, form diols, which then lose water to form the ketone.

Wait, that's a possibility. For example, epoxide ring-opening leading to a diol, which upon dehydration forms a ketone. But how would the reducing agents influence that?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. When treated with an acid, they would hydrolyze back to the ketone, but LiBH4 is a reducing agent, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, and the reduction leads to cleavage, but I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. For example, an ester with a ketone group adjacent. So, the structure would be something like R-C(=O)-COOR'. When reduced, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol, but again, that would be an alcohol, not a ketone.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the product structure again. It's a six-membered ring with an oxygen (tetrahydropyran), a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms the ketone. No, because LiBH4 is a reducing agent, it reduces ketones to alcohols, not forms them.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ketone via some mechanism I'm not familiar with.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction leads to the formation of an alcohol, which then is oxidized to form the ketone. But oxidation would require an oxidizing agent, not a reducing one.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given and the configurations.

The product is a cyclic ketone with substituents. The configuration (R or S) depends on the starting material's configuration and the reaction conditions.

Assuming that the starting material is a chiral ester, and the reduction leads to the ketone with the opposite configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. Do they approach the carbonyl group from the same face, leading to different stereochemistry?

Wait, in the case of ketone reduction, when you have a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl group, the hydride attack can lead to retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the mechanism.

For example, in a planar carbonyl group, the hydride could approach from either side, but if the starting material is chiral, the configuration may influence the approach.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism. Maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ketone.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers. So, if A is (S) and B is (R), or vice versa, then their reactions with different reagents would form the (R) and (S) products, respectively.

But why would different reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) lead to different configurations when the same starting material is used? Or perhaps, if the starting materials are different enantiomers, the same reagent would produce different products.

Wait, maybe the reagents have different selectivities in how they approach the carbonyl group, leading to different configurations.

If the starting material has a chiral center that influences the approach of the reducing agent, then using different reagents could lead to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents lead to different stereochemistry when the same starting material is used because of their different mechanisms.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups via a two-step mechanism: initial formation of an oxonium ion intermediate, followed by hydride attack. But wait, that's for epoxide reductions. For ketones, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide which is then protonated.

In that case, the hydride attack would be from the less hindered side. So if the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center nearby, the hydride attack would be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the resulting alcohol.

Wait, no, because the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and the reducing agents are reducing the ester to form the ketone with a specific configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting too stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible starting materials in the options.

The options give the starting materials as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid in either S or R configuration.

So, the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 has an isobutoxy and an oxo group (a ketone). Position 3 has an ethyl group.

So, the structure would be something like:

CH2CH2C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 (but wait, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no, isobutoxy is OCH(CH3)CH2CH2? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, isobutoxy is OCH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but the substituents are on the same carbon as the oxo group. So, the structure is pentanoic acid with at position 5: oxo (so a ketone) and isobutoxy. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me draw it mentally.

Pentanoic acid is CH3(CH2)3COOH. So, substituents on the 5th carbon (the carboxylic acid carbon is the 5th, I think). Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the carboxylic acid is on the fifth carbon. So, a 5-oxo group would be on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid. But wait, that's impossible because the carboxylic acid is COOH. So, perhaps the oxo group is on the fourth carbon.

Wait, the options say 5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-COOH? No, because that would be on the third carbon.

Wait, wait. The formula for 5-oxopentanoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CH(CO)COOH. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, 5-oxo would be on the fifth carbon, which is the same as the carboxylic acid. So, that can't be. So perhaps it's 4-oxopentanoic acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH2?) → Wait, the substituents are ethyl at position 3, and at position 5 (the COOH carbon?), an isobutoxy and an oxo group.

Wait, maybe it's structured as:

COOH (C5)

|

C4=O

|

C3=CH2CH3

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps it's a pentanoic acid where the COOH is on C5, C4 is a carbonyl (oxo), and C3 has an ethyl group. Also, C5 has an isobutoxy group attached? Or perhaps it's on C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH(Ethyl)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2, but that might not fit.

Anyway, perhaps the key point is that the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with an oxo group and an isobutoxy group.

So, when these are treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester group (if present) is reduced. Wait, the starting materials are acids, not esters, so that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters. Wait, the options list them as pentanoic acid derivatives, so they're acids, not esters.

So, how does a carboxylic acid get reduced? LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they're not usually reduced by LiBH4. LiAlH4 can reduce them to alcohols, but LiBH4 generally can't.

Hmm, this is getting more confusing.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto acids. So, a pentanoic acid with a ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

In that case, the structure would be something like CH2-C(=O)-CH2-COOH. But wait, the options specify 5-oxo, so the COOH is on C5, and the oxo is also on C5. That can't be because the COOH is a -COOH group, which is already a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, but the options say pentanoic acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are not being reduced but are undergoing some kind of elimination. But the question says they're treated with reducing agents.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think about the reaction again.

The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with substituents: ethyl at position 4, and a ketone at position 2.

So, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms the ketone via elimination.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the reagents. Alternatively, the starting material is a cyclic ether with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the ketone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to a ketone.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the configuration.

If the starting materials are enantiomers (A is R, B is S), then when treated with different reagents, they would produce different enantiomers (R and S products).

Looking at the options, option D has A as (R) and B as (S). So, if A is R and B is S, then treating them with different reagents would perhaps produce different products.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product, then the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.

But why would different reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) lead to different configurations when the starting material is the same? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different stereochemistry in the product.

If the starting material is chiral, then the hydride could attack from either face, leading to retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the reagent.

Wait, in ketone reductions, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side. If the starting material has a chiral center, the approach of the hydride would be influenced by that, leading to a specific configuration in the resulting alcohol.

But since the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting material is a secondary alcohol, which upon oxidation forms the ketone. But then the reagents would be oxidizing, not reducing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via elimination of a leaving group. For example, the starting material could be a diol, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, it loses water to form the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a glycol, and the reagent is causing an oxidation to form the ketone. But again, oxidation would require an oxidizing agent, not a reducing agent.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the options. Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must be enantiomers as well. So, options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers.

Now, the question is, which option is correct? Option C: A is S, B is R. Option D: A is R, B is S.

Which of these would lead to the correct products? The first reaction (with LiBH4) gives R, and the second (with BH3) gives S.

Assuming that the reagents cause the configuration to invert or retain, perhaps the correct assignment is option D: A is R, B is S.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. So, maybe it's more selective in how it approaches the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material directly translates to the product's configuration because the same face is attacked by the hydride.

But I'm not certain. Given that, I'll have to make a best guess.

Since the product configurations are R and S for the two reactions, and the starting materials are different, the correct option is either C or D.

If A is S and B is R, which option would produce R and S products?

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, so if the starting material is R, the product is R, and S gives S. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite happens because the reduction leads to inversion.

Wait, but in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration is determined by the hydride approach. If the starting material is a ketone with a certain configuration, the hydride attack from the less hindered side would lead to a specific configuration in the alcohol.

But again, the product is a ketone, which confuses me.

I think I'll have to go with option D: A is R, B is S. Because when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, they would produce R and S products, respectively.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to analyze the role of the reducing agents, the stereochemistry of the products, and the relationship between the starting materials and the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The two reactions yield enantiomers, (R) and (S), indicating that the stereochemistry of the starting materials influences the stereochemistry of the products.

2. **Reducing Agents**: 
   - **LiBH4** is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. However, in this context, it likely facilitates the formation of the ketone product from the starting material.
   - **BH3** is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, but here it may play a role in the reduction process, potentially influencing the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Starting Materials**: The options provided for the starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product because the reducing agents attack from specific faces, leading to either the (R) or (S) configuration in the product.

4. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This would result in identical products, which contradicts the formation of enantiomeric (R) and (S) products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Similar to Option A, this would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This setup allows for the formation of enantiomeric products, depending on the stereochemical influence of the reducing agents.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This also allows for the formation of enantiomeric products, but the stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and products must be considered.

5. **Stereochemical Relationship**: The stereochemistry of the starting material directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. If A is (R) and B is (S), the reactions with LiBH4 and BH3 would produce the (R) and (S) products, respectively. This matches the given products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (A) and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (B), as they lead to the formation of the enantiomeric products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively.

Answer: D
