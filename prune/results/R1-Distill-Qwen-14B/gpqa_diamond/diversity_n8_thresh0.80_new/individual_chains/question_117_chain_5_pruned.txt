Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being chiral, meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image. Chiral molecules are optically active, so they can rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each pairing some of them.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations. But wait, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality, especially if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. The positions here are 6,6' having nitro groups and 2,2' having carboxylate groups. So the substituents are in positions that are symmetric or not? Let me visualize it. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', and the carboxylates at 2 and 2'. Wait, the numbering might make them symmetrical. So if the substituents are in positions that are mirror images, then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. But if the arrangement leads to two different groups on each ring, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the central bond can have E or Z configurations, but that's for alkenes. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but optical isomerism in biphenyls would require that the molecule is not meso and has a plane of symmetry or not. Alternatively, if the substituents on the two rings are such that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it will have optical isomers. So in this case, if each ring has substituents that make the whole molecule chiral, then yes. Since the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2', which are symmetric positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but perhaps the nitro groups are on one ring, and the carboxylate on the other. Or wait, is the structure such that each ring has both a nitro and a carboxylate group? No, the name says 6,6'-dinitro, so each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and 6', and 2,2' have the carboxylate. So each ring has a nitro and carboxylate at opposite positions. Hmm, if that's the case, then the two rings might be mirror images of each other. So for the biphenyl, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents are symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of chirality or a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself isn't chiral, but if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the whole molecule could be chiral. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think of whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If
