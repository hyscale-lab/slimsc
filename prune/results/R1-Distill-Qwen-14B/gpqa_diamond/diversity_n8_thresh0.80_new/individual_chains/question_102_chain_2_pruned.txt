Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and mouse models. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So bicistronic means two ORFs in one vector, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is upstream of an IRES regulatory element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. So the ligand would be translated first, then the receptor because the IRES drives the second round of translation.

Wait, but in the construct, the ligand is first, then the stop in a loxP cassette, then the receptor with IRES, and then a stop in another cassette. Oh, right, so the vector is set up such that using Cre recombinase would delete the stop cassettes, allowing for expression of both ligand and receptor.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. But when visualizing under confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is the green fluorescent protein, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or is not fluorescent.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect expression in the mouse model? Unless the construct isn't expressed in the right cells.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so maybe no fluorescence. But why would they not see any signal? Maybe the GFP isn't being made. Or perhaps the construct isn't being expressed at all.

C) Missing enhancer. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed. But I thought CBA is a constitutive promoter, so maybe enhancer isn't the issue here.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly spliced, the eGFP might not be expressed, or a premature stop codon could truncate the protein. So the fusion might not be functional.

Wait, but how does this relate to the expression in the mouse? The construct is in a bicistronic vector, so the ligand and receptor are co-expressed when Cre is present.

They used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So if the Cre is under SOX10, it should be active in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes or other glial cells.

Wait, but in the question, they transfected the vector into primary astrocytes. The Western blot was done after transfection, but the mouse model is homozygous. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. So the construct would be activated in neural crest cells, which in the mouse would lead to expression of both ligand and receptor.

But in the offspring, when they look under the confocal, no green. So the eGFP isn't lighting up. So the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, or not properly.

Looking at the construct setup: the ligand is at 5', with a stop cassette between ligand and mCherry. The receptor is after IRES, with a stop cassette between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, the vector is designed so that with Cre, the loxP sites are removed. So if Cre is active, the stop cassettes are deleted. So when Cre is present, the ligand and receptor should be expressed. So in the mouse model, SOX10-Cre
