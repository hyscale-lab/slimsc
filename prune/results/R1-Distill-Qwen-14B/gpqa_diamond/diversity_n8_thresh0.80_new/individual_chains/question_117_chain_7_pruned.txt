Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. I remember that this usually happens because of chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements in the molecule.

The question gives four different organic moieties and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Biphenyl compounds can have different conformations. Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule needs a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are on different positions, maybe it's chiral. In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. The molecule is symmetrical if the substituents are mirrored, but wait, it's 6,6' and 2,2', so on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents in positions that are across from each other. Hmm, but the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', so the arrangement might lead to a lack of a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a chiral center or a plane that makes it non-superimposable. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a biphenyl with restricted rotation leading to cis and trans isomerism. Wait, but here the substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. So each benzene ring has two substituents: one nitro at 6 and one carboxylate at 2. So each ring has substituents opposite each other. But the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', so perhaps each ring has substituents in such a way that the whole molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Or maybe it's more about the arrangement leading to a chiral molecule. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. Wait, if the two substituents on each ring are opposite each other, then each ring is symmetrical. So maybe the entire molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the substituents are on the same side or opposite, but in this case, if the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry, then no optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, maybe dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate has substituents that are symmetrical. So, if the substituents are on each ring in positions that mirror each other, then the molecule would be symmetrical, so no optical isomers. Alternatively, if the arrangement leads to lack of symmetry, then it can have optical isomers. I'm not entirely sure about this one yet. I'll come back to it after looking at
