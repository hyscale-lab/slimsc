Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for energy, I think each astronaut's energy should be considered as their relativistic energy, and then sum them up.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the relative speed. So one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), what's the speed of the second astronaut?

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is v = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, no, I think it's (u - v) divided by (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, actually, I might be mixing up the terms. Let me get it straight.

The velocity u is the speed of the second astronaut in the lab frame, and v is the speed of the first astronaut. So from the first astronaut's frame (the one moving at speed v = 0.6c), the speed of the second astronaut (who's moving at u = 0.5c in the same direction) would be?

Wait, but wait a second. If both are moving in the same direction, from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving slower. Wait, but the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c, and the first is at 0.6c. So from the first's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Because when you're in a frame moving at speed v, another object moving at speed u in the same direction in the lab frame would have a speed relative to you of (u - v)/(1
