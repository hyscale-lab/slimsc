Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C, and they give the three Ka values for H₃PO₄ as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are four different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a solution with both a weak acid and its conjugate base, it's a buffer solution. So I think I need to consider the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. But wait, what's the exact situation here with these two salts?

Let me think. KH₂PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation in water should give H2PO4^- and K+ ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, would give 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate ions are HPO4^3-? Or wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it's in various forms. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, it can lose protons to form H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, but in this solution, we have KH2PO4 (so H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which gives HPO4^2-). So the phosphate species in solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the orthophosphate ion concentration. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the fully protonated form, which is a weak acid. But in solution, H3PO4 exists in different forms. So in this solution, perhaps the orthophosphate (H3PO4) isn't present, but its conjugate bases are. Unless the solution is buffered such that it's a certain pH where H3PO4 is significant.

But wait, looking at the given salts, the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? No, wait. Orthophosphate is usually H3PO4, but sometimes people refer to the HPO4^2- as the ortho phosphate ion. Wait, I should double-check that.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. Phosphate ions
