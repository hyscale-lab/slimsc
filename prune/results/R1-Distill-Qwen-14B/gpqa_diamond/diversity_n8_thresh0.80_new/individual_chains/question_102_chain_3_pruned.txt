Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they looked under the confocal microscope. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, the setup: They have a ligand-receptor pair that's supposed to be expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it can express two proteins from a single transcript. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, but I see that there are loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. The ligand is before mCherry, so there's a loxP-stop-loxP between them. The receptor and eGFP have a lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre is introduced, these stops would be excised, allowing the genes to be expressed.

They used a bicistronic vector with the ligand first, then the receptor. The vector uses internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) for the receptor. I remember that IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a second ribosome binding site, but the main point here is that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed.

They also made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means they're detecting the proteins correctly when they're expressed. So the issue isn't with the antibodies or the expression in general.

Now, the mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest cells. Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, enabling the expression of the ligand (under CBA) and the receptor (under IRES). 

But after the offspring are born, they don't see the green signal. Green is from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't being expressed, or something is wrong with its expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the problem here is expression in the same cell, or perhaps in a different cell. Wait, I'm not sure how that would affect the eGFP signal. If the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, perhaps it causes internalization or something, but I don't see how that would prevent eGFP from being expressed. The blot probably shows the receptor, though. Not sure.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct isn't properly trafficked to the cell surface, the eGFP wouldn't be visible under the microscope. eGFP is a fluorescent protein, so if it's stuck in the Golgi, it might not fluoresce, but the Western blot would show the protein. But in the question, after transfection, they used the antibodies on Western blot and saw signals. So if the eGFP is expressed, the blot would detect the receptor. But perhaps in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't properly expressed. Or maybe the construct is faulty.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong, constitutive promoter, I think. The receptor is under an IRES, which is after the ligand. So if the promoter is missing, the ligand wouldn't be expressed, but the Western blot after transfection showed signals, which suggests that expression was happening. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working correctly. But IRES should allow for translation of the second gene. Wait, but if the IRES is not functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But the vector design is bicistronic, so maybe the IRES is driving the receptor.

Wait, in the question, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end and is fused to eGFP. The ligand ORF is at the 5' and fused to mCherry. So the transcription would produce a single mRNA with the ligand ORF first, followed by the IRES, then the receptor ORF with eGFP. So the IRES should allow the receptor to be translated as a separate ORF.

Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So after the ligand's ORF, IRES, then the receptor ORF. So the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor's mRNA without the need for a new RBS. So the receptor should be expressed.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop codons are in place, and if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. For example, if the lox2272 cassette isn't correctly excised, the stop codon might be in frame, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, but the vector has a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor ORF is followed by the stop, then eGFP? Or is the stop within the receptor? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says: "Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette."

Ah, so the ligand ORF is before a stop (with loxP), and the receptor is before a stop (with lox2272). So when Cre is introduced, the loxP stops are excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 stops are excised, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they're breeding to SOX10-Cre mice, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So in these cells, the loxP and lox2272 cassettes are excised, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed correctly.

Why would that be? If the lox2272 cassette isn't properly excised, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. Or maybe the construct is not correctly designed.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector, so the mRNA is ligand, then IRES, then receptor. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor's IRES is after. So when Cre is active, it removes the lox2272 stop, allowing the receptor ORF to be expressed, with eGFP.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, perhaps the stop is in the wrong frame, causing the receptor to be truncated, but the stop is before eGFP. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly spliced.

Wait, another possibility is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop codon is in frame, preventing translation. Let's think: the receptor ORF is followed by a stop codon in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is not active, the stop is present, so the receptor isn't expressed (the stop is in frame, so the ribosome stops translation before eGFP). When Cre is active, the stop is excised, and the receptor followed by eGFP is expressed.

But maybe in the construct, the stop was in the same frame as the eGFP ORF. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is out of frame with the receptor, leading to a frameshift, making the eGFP not correctly expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion is in the wrong reading frame, leading to a non-functional eGFP.

So, if the stop is in the same frame as the eGFP, removing it would
