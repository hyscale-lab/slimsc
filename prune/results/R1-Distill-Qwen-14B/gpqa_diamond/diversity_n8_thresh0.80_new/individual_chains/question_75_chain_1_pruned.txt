Okay, so I've got this science question about transgenic mice and protein expression. Let me try to break it down.

So the person is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for GADD45G, with an added influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But they can't get the protein to overexpress. Hmm.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, I need to find out why the protein isn't being expressed properly. The options are A to D. Let's go through each possibility.

Option A: The antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, a missense would change an amino acid. But wait, the HA tag is presumably being added at the N-terminus. If the coding sequence has a mutation in the HA part, it might affect the tag. But if the HA is for affinity purification, maybe the construct isn't expressed because the tag is messed up, making the protein not bind to the antibody used for purification. But the question is about overexpression—maybe the protein is being expressed, but they can't detect it because the tag is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation affects the protein's stability or function, but in this case, the main issue is lack of overexpression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Ribosomes read the mRNA until they hit a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA). If the sequence has a stop codon early, the protein would be truncated. Let's look at the given DNA sequence. Let's find the stop codon in the mRNA.

The DNA is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. The DNA starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the mRNA starts with AUG. Let me scan for a stop codon in the mRNA. The mRNA is the same as the DNA except T becomes U. So let me look for the complementary sequences of UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, the mRNA is made from the template (negative) strand, which is complementary to the plus (coding) strand. Wait, no, wait: the plus strand is the same as the mRNA. Wait, no. The coding strand is the same as mRNA except T→U. So the given plus strand is the coding sequence, so the mRNA would be the same as this DNA except for T→U.

So looking through the sequence, I'll look for any occurrence of UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA. Let me scan the DNA for the complementary triplets:

Looking for the mRNA sequence, which is the same as the DNA but with T→U.

So let's look for any triplet that could form a stop codon in the mRNA. Let's see:

The DNA sequence is 5' ATG TACC CATAC GATGTT CCA GAT TAC G... etc. So the mRNA would be AUG AUCCG... Oh, wait, I might need to look for UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, another approach: the given plus strand DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same as this but with T→U.

So, in the mRNA, looking for UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for the triplet sequences:

1. ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So, the mRNA starts with AUG, which is the start.

Looking through each triplet:

Let me look for any occurrence of UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking at the end of the sequence: ...GAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is GAGTGA.

So in the mRNA, that would be GAGUGA. Wait, wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is same as plus strand, T→U.

Wait, the last part of DNA is ...CTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part of the DNA is ...GAGTGA. In mRNA, that is GAGUGA.

Wait, looking at the mRNA, looking for any UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, the sequence ends in ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would have ...GAGUGA. Wait, the last triplet is AGA in DNA, which becomes AGA in mRNA (since T→U only changes T to U). Wait, no. Let's see: the last part of the DNA is GAGTGA. So the mRNA would be GAG UGA.

Wait, the triplet is UGA. Oh! So the last codon in the mRNA is UGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, that's in the middle of the sequence.

Wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is same as plus, but T to U. So looking for the stop codons.

Wait, let me think about the entire mRNA. The sequence is 5' to 3' as the DNA is. So the mRNA is the same as the DNA, but T becomes U.

Looking for any UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Let me go through the DNA sequence and see if any triplet becomes a stop codon.

Looking for TAA (which would be UAA in mRNA), TAG (UAG), or TGA (UGA) in the DNA.

Wait, the DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GATGTT CCAGAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TCC CGG AAA GCAG CCAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGC GCC GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCG TGT CAG AGT CAG CCA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TAC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACA TCG ACA TAT GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCC GGC GGC GAC CTG CAT TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC T TGG AGA AGC T CGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Hmm, looking for TGA (which in mRNA is UGA).

Looking through the DNA for TGA triplets:

Looking at positions... let's see:

...CTGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTG
