Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and relative velocities. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. Alright, the question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. 

Wait, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. The formula I know is v = c/n, where v is the speed in the medium. Oh right, so in the glass, the speed of the light would normally be 1/n because c is 1 here. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So now I'm thinking about relative motion here.

So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, but in the same direction as the light beam. Hmm, wait, same direction as the beam? So if the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction, how does that affect the speed observed?

I think this is a problem involving relative velocity, perhaps using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but glass is a material, and unless v is a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects might not be necessary. But I'm not sure if the question expects a relativistic approach or a classical one.

Wait, in the case where the medium is moving, how does the speed of light in that medium change according to the observer? Let's think about it. The speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n, which is 1/n here. But the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the observer in the lab sees the light's speed as the sum of the medium's velocity and the speed of the light within the medium? Or is it more complicated?

Wait a second, in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the medium is moving with velocity v, and the light in that medium has velocity u (which is 1/n in the medium's frame), then from the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u + v? But wait, that would be u + v, but wait, the direction matters. Both the medium and the light are moving in the same direction. So the observer would perceive the light as moving at (1/n) + v?

But wait, that feels off because I think the speed of light is measured as c in any inertial frame, but wait, that's only in a vacuum. When the light is in a medium, its speed is lower. But then again, the medium is moving, so the lab frame would see the light's speed as the sum of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe it's not as straightforward because the medium's motion affects the light's speed. Hmm, perhaps I should model this using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the medium's frame is 1/n. So u is 1/n, and the medium is moving at velocity v. So the lab frame would see u' = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v)(1/n)/c²). But since c=1, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/(n)).

Wait, let's compute that. The denominator is 1 + (v/n) because c squared is 1. So the denominator is (n + v)/n. So the whole expression becomes ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/ (n + v).

Wait, wait, but the numerator is (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n. Then divided by (n + v)/n, which is the denominator after factoring. So ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). So the speed of light as observed would be (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches. Option B is 1, which would imply the speed is c regardless, which only holds in vacuum, right? So option B can't be correct. Option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v), which would only be the case if the direction of velocity was opposite. And option D is (1 -n v)/(n+v), which doesn't look right either.

Wait, but wait a second. The velocity addition formula applies when you're moving from one frame to another. But in this case, the light is in a medium which is moving. So is the correct approach to use the velocity addition formula? Because the medium is moving at v relative to the lab, and the light's speed in the medium is 1/n. So the lab would see the light's speed as (1/n + v)/(1 + (v)(1/n)).

Wait, but wait, no. When using the relativistic velocity addition formula, u is the velocity in the medium's frame. So the scenario is, the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the medium (glass) is u = 1/n in the same direction as v. So the lab would measure the speed u' as:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Substituting u = 1/n,

u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (v)(1/n)).

Let me compute this:

Denominator: 1 + v/n = (n + v)/n.

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

So dividing numerator by denominator, [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The light beam travels through the glass, which has an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer.

1. **Speed of light in the glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) in a vacuum.

2. **Relativistic velocity addition**: Since the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory frame, the speed of light observed in the laboratory frame can be calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv}
   \]
   Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplifying the expression**: The denominator \( 1 + \frac{v}{n} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{n + v}{n} \), and the numerator \( \frac{1}{n} + v \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{1 + nv}{n} \). Dividing these gives:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1 + nv}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Matching with the options**: The derived expression \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \) matches option A. The other options are incorrect because:
   - Option B (\( 1 \)) implies the speed of light is \( c \) in all frames, which is only true in a vacuum.
   - Option C (\( \frac{1 + nv}{n - v} \)) would apply if the glass were moving in the opposite direction.
   - Option D (\( \frac{1 - nv}{n + v} \)) does not match the correct relativistic calculation.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \).

Answer: A
