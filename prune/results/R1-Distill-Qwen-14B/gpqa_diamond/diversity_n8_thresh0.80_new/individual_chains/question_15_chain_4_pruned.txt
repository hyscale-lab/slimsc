Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

So the question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their host stars have the same radius, but the star for Planet_1 is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's host.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is related to the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. Oh right, the formula I remember is that the transit probability (p) is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a, but actually, no, I think more accurately it's (R_p / a) times (1/(1 - e²))^½, but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / a) divided by something else. Wait, maybe I should think about the geometry.

The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (or more precisely, the width where the planet can be in front of the star) to the area of the sky. But I think a simpler way is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but wait, no. Let me think again.

The probability of transit (p) is given by (R_p / a) * (1 / sin(i)), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But wait, if the orbit is randomly oriented, the average value of 1/sin(i) is 1/(sin i average). Hmm, no, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight.

The transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star's disk to the distance between the planet and the star in the plane of the sky. Oh wait, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the orbit in the plane. Wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, I remember a formula p ≈ (R_star + R_planet)/a * (something else), but perhaps I'm mixing it up
