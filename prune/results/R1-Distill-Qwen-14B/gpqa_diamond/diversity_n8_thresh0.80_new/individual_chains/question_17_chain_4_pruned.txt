Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me see what I remember about this.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I think I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. A high Kf means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is [Ca(EDTA)]^2-. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in solution. Because the complex doesn't dissociate much (since Kf is so large), the free [Ca²+] should be really low.

I think the formula to use here is the one that relates the concentration of the complex to the free ions. The formation constant equation is:

Kf = [Ca(EDTA)^2-] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I guess that's the concentration of the complex, let's call it C.

So [Ca(EDTA)]^2- = 0.02 M.

But what about [EDTA^4-]? Hmm, I think when EDTA is in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal. Oh, right! For EDTA, which is a polyprotic acid, at a certain pH (usually around 10), it exists mostly as the Y^4- form, which is the one that complexes with metal ions. So I can assume that [EDTA^4-] is approximately 1 M? Wait, no, wait a second. No, wait, the total concentration of EDTA species would be [Y^4-] plus all the protonated forms. But in the complex, the EDTA is already tied up as part of the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of
