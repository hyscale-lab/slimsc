Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard basis vectors for spin systems or something similar. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) as a column vector.

Wait, I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So I'll need to compute the expectation value of P_z squared and then subtract the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root of that.

But first, the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. That probably means that the state is expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. So maybe I can directly compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ from the state vector.

Wait, no. The state is given as a column vector, which I can consider as a ket vector in this basis. If the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, then the matrix elements of P_z are diagonal in this basis. Because when an operator is expressed in its eigenbasis, it's diagonal.

Looking at P_z's matrix: it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues, and the columns are the eigenvectors, perhaps? Wait, no, in matrix form, each column is the eigenvector multiplied by the eigenvalue? Or wait, no, the matrix is diagonal, so the columns are the eigenvectors scaled by their eigenvalues. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, if the basis is the eigenvectors, then the matrix should be diagonal, and each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for each basis vector.

So for P_z, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the first basis vector |1⟩ has eigenvalue ħ, |2⟩ has 0, and |3⟩ has -ħ.

The state vector is given as ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Let me represent this as |ψ⟩ = a|1⟩ + b|2⟩ + c|3⟩, where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Wait, but to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can just take the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute |a|^2 and |c|^2.

|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ → 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal with the squares of the eigenvalues.

So P_z² has diagonal elements (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|² * ħ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ħ².

Which is (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Now the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The state is given as a column vector in the P_z eigenbasis. So each component directly corresponds to the amplitude for that eigenstate. So calculating the expectation values as I did should be correct.

Yes, because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the amplitudes.

So the uncertainty is indeed ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle = a|1\rangle + b|2\rangle + c|3\rangle$, where the components of the state vector are $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ corresponding to the basis vectors $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively.

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
