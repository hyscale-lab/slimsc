Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch out the target molecule to visualize where each substituent is. So, the structure is benzene with three groups: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me number the positions. Let's say the nitro group is in position 3, the ethoxy in position 1, and the tert-butyl in position 2. Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering might vary based on substituents. Let me think about the substituents' relative positions.

Wait, wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering starts at the ethoxy group. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That forms a meta arrangement between nitro and ethoxy? No, wait, the positions are 1, 2, 3. Hmm, so ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the nitro is adjacent to ethoxy (positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent). So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. That's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, the order in which these substituents are added will determine their positions due to directing effects.

Now, benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. Each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Let's think about each substituent's effect:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH2CH3) is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group. It's an ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl group is a bulky, activating group (since alkyl groups are activating) and also an ortho/para director.
- Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So
