Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on plx.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (d) is inversely proportional to its parallax (p), so d = 1/p, right? But wait, isn't parallax measured in parsecs? Oh yeah, I think so. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. That makes sense. So the number of stars in a sphere of radius r would depend on r cubed, because volume scales as r^3.

So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. Let me think about how parallax relates to distance. Parallax p is inversely proportional to distance d, p = 1/d. So if I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us, the thickness of the shell would be a small change in d, say dd. The volume of that shell is 4πd² dd.

Wait, but in terms of parallax, since p = 1/d, then d =
