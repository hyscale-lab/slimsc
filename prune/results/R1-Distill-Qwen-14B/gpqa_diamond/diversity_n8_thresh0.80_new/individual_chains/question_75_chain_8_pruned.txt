Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a problem with overexpressing a protein in transgenic mice. They introduced a GADD45G construct with a HA tag, but it's not working. The given DNA sequence is the plus strand, so we're looking at the coding sequence.

Hmm, the main issue is that the protein isn't being expressed as expected. The options suggest possible reasons: maybe the HA tag has a mutation, the ribosome is stopping early, proteolysis is happening, or a tRNA issue.

Looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any stop codons that might cause premature termination. Because if the ribosome stops early, that would prevent the full protein from being made.

Wait, the sequence ends with ...TGA3'. Let me find where that is. Let me scan the sequence. Oh, I see a 'TGA' in there. Let me look again.

Looking through the sequence, I see '...TGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3' 

Wait, the very end part is 'GAGTGA'. Let me parse that. So, looking at the last few bases: 'CGAGTGA'. Breaking that down into codons. Each codon is three nucleotides.

Let me see: The last part is ...GAGTGA3. So that's in the DNA. Let's look at the coding sequence.

DNA is read in triplets, but the mRNA is the complement of the DNA (except T becomes U). So for the coding strand, the mRNA would be the same except T becomes U.

Wait, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA except for
