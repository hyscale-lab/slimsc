Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stumped, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and we're supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are some point groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. Hmm, point groups are part of molecular symmetry, so I need to figure out what molecule E is and then its symmetry.

Let me read through the reactions again to get a clear picture.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. What's a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? Hmm. Maybe something like sodium reacting with chlorine? No, that's 2:1. Wait, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something. Or perhaps it's a reaction to form a compound with a certain structure.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide? Or maybe a metal oxide? Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like a nitrate or something with a high oxidation state.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E. If E is dangerous, maybe it's a gas like chlorine or something else. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound, like ozone or something else.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's HNO3 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak). Hmm, but let's think about the first reaction again.

Wait, the first reaction: 8 equivalents of gas B. So maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2. If A is a metal or non-metal reacting with O2, for example, but 8 moles of O2 per mole of A seems high. Alternatively, maybe A is something like P reacting with O2 to form P4O10, but that's a 5:3 ratio. Wait, P4O10 is when P reacts with O2 in a 4:5 ratio, but that's not 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where each molecule of A requires 8 B molecules.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the products. When C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So perhaps C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, releases A and two acids. Maybe C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, another thought: If C is a nitrate, and when it reacts with water, it produces HNO3 (strong acid) and perhaps another acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, hydrolyzing to H2SO3 and another acid. But wait, C reacting with water gives A back. So A is probably a metal or something that can form multiple compounds.

Wait, maybe A is sodium (Na). If so, reacting with B, which could be O2. Sodium oxide maybe? But then sodium oxide is Na2O, which is produced by 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. Hmm, that's a high ratio. Maybe A is something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S), and B is O2. S + O2 forms SO2 or SO3. Wait, for SO3, the reaction is S + 3O2 → 2SO3. So that's 3 equivalents of O2 per S. The first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a gas like ozone (O3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be something like phosgene (but that's more of a carbonyl compound). Or perhaps E is something like chlorine dioxide, which is quite dangerous.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are gases. So if D is H2O (but that's a liquid at room temp), maybe not. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl? No, because B is a gas in the first reaction. Alternatively, D could be CO2 and B is H2? But not sure.

Wait, another angle: H is a solvent, and it's formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. So H could be something like H2O. Then D and B would be something that combines to make water. Like D is H2 and B is O2? But then H would be H2O. That's plausible. So D is H2 and B is O2. Then, reaction D + B → H would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the problem says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio, so 1 mole each. Wait, the equation would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit 1:1.

Wait, another possibility: D is CO2 and B is H2O. But H2O is a liquid at standard conditions. Maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl? They form NH4Cl, which is a solid, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol. But that would require D and B to be something that forms ethanol, like maybe C2H5OH. Hmm, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps D is HCl and B is NaOH. But no, B is a gas in the first reaction. So B must be a gas, like O2, Cl2, etc.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the hydrolysis of C. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So maybe C is a nitride, which upon hydrolysis gives a metal hydroxide, NH3 (but that's a base), which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which upon hydrolysis gives H2S (a weak acid) and another acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then when it reacts with water, maybe it's
