Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, I'll have to go through each step carefully because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions. 

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. But wait, since it's dibromoadamantane, the structure is a bit complex. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

Heating with KOH would deprotonate and eliminate HBr. The product would be an alkene. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is the carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination typically gives an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the product isn't just an elimination but perhaps a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH being a strong base, elimination is more likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's an E2 elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But then where would the carbonyl come from? Oh wait, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but an epoxide. But no, adding a base to a dihalide doesn't form an epoxide. Wait, wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. That suggests maybe an ester, ketone, or something similar. So maybe the reaction isn't a simple elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a ring-opening reaction under strong base. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a specific isomer. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but that would require two substitutions, which would be more complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe it's a double elimination, forming an alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene or perhaps an allene. Wait, but that still doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait another thought. Maybe the KOH isn't just causing elimination but perhaps a ring-opening. Adamantane is a highly strained structure? No, adamantane is actually quite stable because of its structure. So maybe not ring-opening. Wait, perhaps the product is cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit with the IR either.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the NMR data. The product 1 has an NMR with peaks at 4.79 (2H), which is probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) which is likely the adamantane structure, maybe as a bridge or something. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. But starting from a dihalide and using KOH, how would that happen? Maybe a substitution followed by elimination? Or perhaps the base is causing some kind of rearrangement, like a pinacol rearrangement? Wait, pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols, but we have dihalides.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with base and forms a carbene or some intermediate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Let's think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If KOH
