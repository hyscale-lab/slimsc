Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll probably have to calculate both values and pick the matching option.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of a solution, the concentration halves, right? Because the volume doubles. So the initial acetic acid concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acid, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a minute, when you dilute a weak acid, does it dissociate more? Oh right, but for the initial concentration, I think we can just calculate it as 0.025 M because dilution doesn't change the dissociation much in this context, unless there's a significant change in the strength. But I think for this problem, we can proceed with the diluted concentration.

Next, when titrating, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles first. Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Wait, wait, but we diluted it. So after dilution, the moles are still the same because we're just adding more solvent. So 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. After dilution to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M, but moles are still 0.001.

So for the titration, moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point: same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, the problem asks for two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of
