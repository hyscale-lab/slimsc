Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass is moving. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects move, it can affect the way we observe things like light. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact concepts here.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I think I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change things?

But wait, isn't this a case where the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the lab frame, and we're looking at the speed of light in that moving medium? I'm trying to recall whether the speed of light depends on the motion of the source or medium. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium?

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. So in the glass, the speed of light is c/n when the glass is at rest. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the speed as observed in the lab?

Wait, but the options don't have a simple c/n. Let me think about the situation. The glass is moving towards the observer, same
