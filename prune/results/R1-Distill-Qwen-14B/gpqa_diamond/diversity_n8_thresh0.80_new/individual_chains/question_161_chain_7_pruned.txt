Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a transmission electron microscope.

So, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps, and even with that, some gas particles remained. He determined the mean free path as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

But then, when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed to λ2. The temperature stayed the same, so that's not a variable here. Hmm, what affects the mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n * π * d² / 2), where n is the number density of the gas molecules and d is the collision diameter. So if n changes, λ changes. But why would n change when the electron beam is on?

Oh, wait. The electron beam is a stream of high-energy electrons. When they hit the gas molecules, they might cause the gas to ionize. Ionized gas particles would have a different behavior. I remember that in plasmas, the mean free path can be longer because the ions are more spaced out, or maybe it's different depending on the interactions.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, it can cause the gas to become ionized. So the gas is no longer in a neutral state. The ionized particles, which are charged, experience different forces. In a vacuum, charged particles can be influenced by electric fields, but if the electron beam itself is providing an electric field, perhaps the ions are accelerated or move away.

Wait, but in ultra-high vacuum conditions, even with some gas, the mean free path is already quite large. When you ionize the gas, the ions might have a longer mean free path because the electron beam could cause them to be more spaced out. Or maybe the ionization leads to more frequent collisions with the beam or other structures.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons. These electrons can cause the gas to become a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path for electrons is much longer because they are free to move, but how about the gas ions?

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to expand or change pressure. Wait,
