Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, okay, let's break this down. First, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. So I think I should calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. The number of moles would be Molarity × Volume. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol of acetic acid.

Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, because when you dilute, the concentration decreases. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Because acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (OH-) in a 1:1 ratio.

So the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, same as before. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10.00 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of that equivalence point volume.

So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, for the pH at 25% titration, I think we're dealing with a buffer solution. Because only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution will have some unreacted acetic acid and some acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

So, let's model this. The initial moles after dilution are 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. When we add 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So that's 0.25 mmol.

Since the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O. So the OH- will convert some CH3COOH into CH3COO^-.

So initial moles:
CH3COOH: 0.001 mol
CH3COO^-: 0

After adding 0.00025 mol of OH-:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol

But wait, the total volume now is the diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.736.

So pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) 

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.4771.

So pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.259. Hmm, that's around 4.26.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate [A-]/[HA]. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3. So log(1/3)= -0.4771.

So pH = pKa - 0.4771 ≈ 4.736 - 0.4771 = 4.2589, which is about 4.26. So that matches option A's first value.

Wait, but option D's first pH is 4.57. Maybe I'm missing something. Did I miss dilution in the calculation? Wait, wait. Let me double-check the moles.

Wait, the moles after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. I think that's correct. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, 0.1 M is 0.00025 mol OH-.

Yes, that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will be a solution of acetate ions in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution, so pH >7.

So when all 0.001 mol of acetic acid reacts with 0.001 mol of NaOH, the resulting solution is 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in the total volume of the diluted solution plus the NaOH added.

Wait, the total volume at equivalence point is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

We can set up the expression for Kb:
Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH-], Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-] ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 for the equivalence point. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D: 4.57;6.92

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. Let me recalculate Kb.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So for Kb = 5.405e-10, c = 0.02 M.

We can use the formula for a weak base:

pOH = (pKb - log c)/2 + ... Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Because 3.288e-6 is the [OH^-], right?

Wait, 1.081e-11, square root is approx 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ around 5.485.

So pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515.

Wait, that's about 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52. But earlier, I thought the first pH was 4.26, which is option A's first value. So that would make option A the correct one.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the equivalence point, I thought my first calculation gave pH ≈9, but that was a miscalculation. So the correct pH is around 8.52.

Wait, but wait, when I first thought I was getting 9, but after rechecking, it's 8.52. So that's option A.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the 25% titration, I thought the pH is around 4.26, which matches option A's first value. So the first part is 4.26, second is 8.52. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but why am I getting a different result when I thought the equivalence pH would be around 8.5?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation without the approximation.

Wait, let me try without assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me set up the equation x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let me use quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute each part:

(5.405e-10)^2 = approx (5.4e-10)^2 = 2.916e-19.

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So D = 2.916e-19 + 4.324e-11 → but wait, 4.324e-11 is much bigger than 2.9e-19, so D ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x = [-5.4e-10 + 6.575e-6 ] / 2 → since the other root would be negative, which we can ignore.

So x ≈ (6.575e-6 - 5.4e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈ 3.2875e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈3.2875e-6, which gives pOH≈5.485, pH≈8.515, which is 8.52. So that's correct.

So option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches both the 25% and equivalence point.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is: 4.26;8.52.

But earlier, when I calculated the 25% titration, I found the pH to be approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value. So yes, option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57;6.92.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the 25% titration pH was 4.26. So why is option D present? Am I missing something?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 20 * 0.05 / 1000 = 0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That seems correct.

Wait, when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M), that's 0.00025 mol of OH-.

So the moles of acetic acid and acetate are as I thought.

So, yes, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, I see that option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92. So perhaps I did a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution correctly. Let me check.

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log (n_A-/n_HA). Because when the solution is diluted, the ratio remains the same as the mole ratio, since both are diluted by the same factor.

Wait, but in the Henderson equation, since both species are diluted equally, the ratio [A-]/[HA] remains 1/3, so it's the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I calculated the concentrations incorrectly.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L → 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is -0.4771.

pKa is 4.736. So pH is 4.736 -0.4771 = 4.2589, which is 4.26.

So yes, that's correct. So option A's first value matches.

Thus, the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.040 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH required} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Concentration of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M}.
\]

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of this volume has been added:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Using the approximation:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
