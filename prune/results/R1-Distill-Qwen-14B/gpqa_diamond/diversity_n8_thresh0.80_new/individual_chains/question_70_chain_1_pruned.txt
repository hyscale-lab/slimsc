Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about molecular symmetry groups of a product E. Hmm, molecular symmetry... that's about the point group of a molecule, right? So I remember that different molecules have different symmetry elements, like axes, planes, etc., and based on that, they fall into certain point groups.

The problem gives a series of reactions, so I think I need to figure out what the compounds are first. Let me break down the reactions.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 8:1 for B to A. What's a red product that forms from a reaction of a solid and a gas? Wait, I'm thinking about transition metals. Maybe something like sulfur or lead? Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, the formation of a metal halide. Oh, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, what red compounds do I know? Maybe something like mercury(II) sulfide is red, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Oh! Wait, I'm thinking of lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown, not red. Maybe copper-based compounds? Copper(II) sulfate is blue. Hmm, maybe it's not metal-based.

Wait another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with a halogen. No, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium and B is chlorine. Wait, sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl, which is white, not red. Hmm.

Wait, bright red could be something like sulfur trioxide, but that's a liquid. Or maybe a metal sulfide. Oh, wait, maybe it's lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a polymer or a colored complex.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the next reaction. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So E is a gas or a dangerous compound. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is exposed to water, it produces a metal and two acids. That suggests that C is a metal oxide. Because metal oxides
