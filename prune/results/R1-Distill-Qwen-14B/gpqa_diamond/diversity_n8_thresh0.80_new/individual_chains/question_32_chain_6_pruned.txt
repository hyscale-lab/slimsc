Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, and X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then its mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they're usually referring to the kinetic energy each beam has. But I also think that sometimes the total energy (which includes rest mass energy) is considered. So I need to figure out what exactly is being asked here.

The problem states the speed is 0.96c. So I'll need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which depends on its rest mass and the speed. Then, perhaps the kinetic energy is what the collider provides.

Wait, the energy of the collider is the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy? I think for heavy ions, the energy is given as the total energy, but I'm not entirely sure. But given the options, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that it's the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, I think for particle colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy each particle has. Or wait, actually, in accelerators, the energy given to the particles is their kinetic energy. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma * m c², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c².

So the question is, what is the energy of RHIC? So I think that's the kinetic energy per nucleus. Or perhaps the total energy.

But let me think again. The problem says, what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So the speed is given, so I can compute gamma, then find the total energy, and then maybe subtract the rest mass energy to get the kinetic energy, which would be the energy provided by the collider.

Wait, the question wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps the total energy (gamma m c²) is what RHIC imparts.
