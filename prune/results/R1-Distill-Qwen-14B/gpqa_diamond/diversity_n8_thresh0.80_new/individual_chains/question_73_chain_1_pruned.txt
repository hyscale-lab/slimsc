Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, first I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds because of the way velocities add up in special relativity.

Oh right, because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use the classical velocity addition. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Let me recall. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relative velocity depends on the frame. Oh, wait, in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of one of them, what is the other's speed?

Wait, but the question is about the relative speed. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's the speed of B relative to A.

Wait, no, I think the formula is v_rel = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Because if we're finding the speed of B relative to A, since A is the observer, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A's 0.6c.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, then the relative velocity would actually be the difference in their speeds divided by (1 minus the product of their velocities over c²).

So, v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So v_rel is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving slower than A from A's perspective, so the speed is 0.1428c, or approximately 0.14c. So that would be one of the options. Looking at the options, option D and C have 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. So each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. Oh, but wait, the rest mass energy is mc². So astronaut A has mass 2m, so his energy is gamma_A * (2m)c². Similarly, astronaut B has energy gamma_B * (3m)c².

So I need to compute gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for A, v=0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So A's energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For B, v=0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈
