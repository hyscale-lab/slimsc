Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, so we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I think the masses might not directly affect the elemental ratios here because the question is about the photospheric composition. Maybe it's just a distractor.

The given data includes some abundance ratios using the EW method. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So that's the solar values.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so that's [Si/Star_2]_1 divided by [Si/Star_2]_2? Or wait, no, it's the ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Or maybe [Si/Star_2]_1 divided by [Si/Star_2]_2? Hmm, wait, no, actually, the problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's (n_Si in Star_1) divided by (n_Si in Star_2).

Wait, no. Wait, the [X/Y] notation usually represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio, and then the actual ratio is 10^[X/Y].

But let's think about what each star's abundance is.

First, let's calculate the solar abundances. For Fe, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, so the solar Fe/H is 0. But wait, the given data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 for the Sun. Wait, that means log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The given numbers are 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, Mg: log(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So the Sun's nFe is 3.16e-5 per H, nMg is 1e-5 per H.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 is 0. So Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun). So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So Star_1's Fe is same as Sun's.

But what about the other elements?

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1
