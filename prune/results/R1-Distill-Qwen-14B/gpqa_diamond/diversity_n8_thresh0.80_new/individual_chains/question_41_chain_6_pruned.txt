Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c / n. But wait, that's the speed of the light relative to the medium itself, right? So if the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame?

I think this has to do with relative motion and maybe the addition of velocities. Oh, right! This is probably a problem involving special relativity because we're dealing with velocities and the speed of light. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is less than c, but when the medium is moving, how does that combine?

I recall something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame relative to the new frame. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would be affected.

But wait, the light is already moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of the light relative to the glass is c/n, since that's how it's moving in the glass. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, we have to calculate the speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's speed in the glass is c/n, but in which direction? Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, perhaps the lab frame would see the light moving at v_glass + v_light_glass. But wait, that might not be correct because velocities don't just add up linearly in relativity, especially when dealing with the speed of light.

No, wait, according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, if an object is moving at u in a frame moving at v relative to the lab, then the object's speed in the
