Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and some properties. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are about which statement is correct regarding these matrices in the context of quantum mechanics.

First, I need to recall some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is unitary. Also, the exponential of a matrix (like e^X) is a key component in the time evolution.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.
Wait, the norm change. So, in quantum mechanics, the time evolution operator U should be unitary because it preserves the norm. If U is unitary, then for any vector v, ||Uv|| = ||v||. So e^X would be unitary only if X is Hermitian, because e^{iH} is unitary when H is Hermitian. So I need to check if X is Hermitian.

Looking at matrix X:
X = [i, -1, 2i;
     1, 0, 1;
     2i, -1, -i]

To check if X is Hermitian, X should equal its conjugate transpose (X†). Let me find X†.

The conjugate of X's elements:
First row: -i, -1, -2i
Second row: -1, 0, -1
Third row: -2i, -1, i

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate transpose swaps rows and columns and takes complex conjugates. Let me compute X†:

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† will have columns as rows of X's conjugate.

So X†:

Column 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Row 1 of X†: -i, 1, -2i

Wait, no. Wait, the (i,j) element of X† is the (j,i) element of X*, so let me compute each element.

X†[1,1] = X[1,1]* → (i)* = -i
X†[1,2] = X[2,1]* → 1 → 1
X†[1,3] = X[3,1]* → (2i)* = -2i
Similarly, X†[2,1] = X[1,2]* → (-1)* = -1
X†[2,2] = X[2,2]* → 0 → 0
X†[2,3] = X[3,2]* → (-1)* = -1
X†[3,1] = X[1,3]* → (2i)* = -2i
X†[3,2] = X[2,3]* → 1 → 1
X†[3,3] = X[3,3]* → (-i)* = i

Putting it together, X† is:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare with X:
X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is not equal to X. For example, X[1,1] is i, X†[1,1] is -i. So X is not Hermitian.

If X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. If e
