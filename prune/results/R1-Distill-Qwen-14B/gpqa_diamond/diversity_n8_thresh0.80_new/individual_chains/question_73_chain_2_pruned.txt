Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through it.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So, to find the relative speed, I probably need to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, is that right? I think that's the formula for when you have two velocities in the same direction. Let me recheck. Oh wait, no, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)) when adding velocities, but in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, maybe I should subtract the smaller from the larger. Wait no, wait. Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second? Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the relative speed between them. So which one is the reference frame? Because in relativity, the relative velocity depends on who's measuring.

Wait, the problem says "relative speed," which I think refers to the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So, for instance, what is the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame.

So, let me apply the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (the frame of astronaut 1?), and v is the velocity of the original frame relative to the new frame (so astronaut 2's speed from astronaut 1's perspective). Wait, maybe I should get that straight.

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So from astronaut 1's perspective,
