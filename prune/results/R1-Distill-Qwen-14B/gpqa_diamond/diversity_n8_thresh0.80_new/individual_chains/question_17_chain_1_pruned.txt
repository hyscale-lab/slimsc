Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions, like calcium. The stoichiometric complex here means that each Ca^2+ is bound by one EDTA^4- molecule, I think. So the complex is CaEDTA^(2-), because Ca is +2 and EDTA is -4? Wait, no, wait—EDTA has a charge of -4 when it's deprotonated. So when it binds Ca^2+, the complex would be neutral? Or maybe it's CaEDTA^2-? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, Ca^2+ is +2, EDTA^4- is -4. So when they combine, the charge would be (2+) + (4-) = 2-? So the complex would have a charge of 2-? Or am I getting this wrong? Maybe I should think about the dissociation.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K. I think the formation constant (Kf) is for the reaction where the complex forms. So the reaction would be:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or maybe Ca-EDTA^(2–), or CaEDTA²⁻? Not sure about the exact formula, but the charges should balance.)

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a large value, meaning the complex is very stable. So at equilibrium, most of the EDTA would be in the complex form.

But the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when the complex dissociates, it would release some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Wait, but since the complex is CaEDTA²–, when it dissociates, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the reaction would be:

CaEDTA²– ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So Kf = [CaEDTA²–]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4–]) = 5e10.

Wait, but in this case, we are looking at the dissociation of the complex into ions. So the dissociation constant Kd would be the inverse of Kf. Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the equilibrium expression for the dissociation is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4–] / [CaEDTA²–] = 2e-11.

But the solution starts with 0.02 M of the complex. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium as x. Since EDTA^4– is a ligand, but if the solution is at ideal pH (which I think means that all the EDTA is in the deprotonated form, so [EDTA^4–] is not affected by other protons), perhaps we can ignore activity coefficients.

Wait, but if the complex dissociates, for every mole of complex that dissociates, it produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4–. So if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, let's say that at equilibrium, it's 0.02 - x. But if x is very small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Let me check if that's valid.

Given that Kd is 2e-11, which is very small. So the dissociation is not favored; very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, x should be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA²–] ≈ 0.02 M.

So then, the equilibrium expression becomes:

Kd ≈ [Ca²+][EDTA^4–] / 0.02 = 2e-11.

But wait, [EDTA^4–] is tricky. Because in solution, the EDTA can exist in different protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think implies that the pH is such that EDTA is mostly in its deprotonated form, EDTA^4–. So I can assume that [EDTA^4–] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration. Or wait, no, because some of the EDTA is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex as the only source of EDTA. So the total EDTA is in two forms: as the free EDTA^4– and as the complex CaEDTA²–. But wait, the complex is CaEDTA²–, so each complex contains one EDTA^4–. So the total EDTA is [EDTA^4–] + [CaEDTA²–] = [EDTA_total].

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, which is CaEDTA²–. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²– is 0.02 M. The EDTA comes only from this complex, because the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So, perhaps, the total EDTA is 0.02 M, but this includes both the free EDTA^4– and the EDTA bound in the complex.

So, [EDTA^4–] = (total EDTA) – [CaEDTA²–] = (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 M, since x is very small. Hmm, but wait, no: the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA^4– and the EDTA in the complex. So,

Total EDTA (EDTA_total) = [EDTA^4–] + [CaEDTA²–].

But the problem says that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So [CaEDTA²–] = 0.02 M initially. But upon dissociation, some of that dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4–.

Wait
