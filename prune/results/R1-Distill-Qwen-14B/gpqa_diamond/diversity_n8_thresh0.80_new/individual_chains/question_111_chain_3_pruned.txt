Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them to the options given.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which makes me think of elimination reactions, possibly E2 mechanisms. But wait, another possibility is that this could be a conjugate addition or some kind of cycloaddition. Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So when a ketone reacts with such a compound in the presence of a strong base, it's likely a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. Or perhaps it's an enolate formation followed by some kind of addition.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has a ketone at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. The cyclohexanone ring is substituted with an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl at 6. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1, an ethyl at C2, and methyl groups at C6 and also another methyl perhaps? Wait, 2-ethyl would be an ethyl substituent on C2, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups on C2 and C6. So wait, the structure is a cyclohexanone (C1=O), C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one: so at position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group attached. So that's a geminal di-substitution on C2. So C2 has two methyl groups and an ethyl? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl would be a single substituent (ethyl) on C2. 2,6-dimethyl would mean a methyl on C2 and another on C6. So perhaps the structure is cyc
