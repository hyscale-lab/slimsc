Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that the Pi-plus is stationary and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The masses given are Pi-plus is 139.6 MeV/c², and the mu-plus is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, and what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So when solving, I can probably ignore their rest mass, right?

So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the final momentum vectors of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Now, the question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles. Oh wait, right! The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So KE = (total E) - (m c²).

But wait, the total energy comes from the decay. So the initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the Pi-plus because it's at rest. So total energy is 139.6 MeV.

The total energy of the products must equal this, because energy is conserved. But wait, the neutrino has almost no rest mass, so its total energy is approximately its kinetic energy, right? Or maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think. The energy of each particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the muon, its energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass. For the neutrino, since m is negligible, E ≈ pc.

Since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are the same. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (so neutrino has same p but opposite direction).

So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
And for the neutrino: E_nu ≈ p c (since m_nu is negligible)

The sum of these energies should equal the initial energy, which is the rest mass of the pion: 139.6 MeV.

So: sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6

Hmm, this looks like an equation with one variable, p c. Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

I need to solve for x.

Let me rearrange this. Let me move x to the other side:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

So the equation becomes:

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

Cancel x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x

Let me compute the squares:

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49. Wait that can't be right because 105^2 is 11025, so 105.7^2 should be a bit higher. Let me compute it precisely.

105.7 * 105.7:

100 *100 = 10000
100*5.7 = 570
5.7*100 = 570
5.7*5.7 = 32.49
So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² where a=100, b=5.7.

So 10000 + 2*(100*5.7) + 5.7² = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV². So that's correct.

Similarly, 139.6^2 is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that.

139.6^2: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600. But since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So going back to the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Wait, where did 279.2 come from? Because 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So rearrange to find x:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute the right side: 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's see:

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= 8315.67 (because 19488 - 11172 = 8316, and 0.16-0.49 is -0.33, so 8315.67?)

So 279.2 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So let's compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is 60.33 higher than 8315.67.

So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784 ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Hmm, so x is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p = x / c. But in units where c=1, it's just x=29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the equation, x is equal to p*c. So p = x / c, but in the equation, x is in units of MeV, since p is in MeV/c, so x = p*c would be in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the units. Let me think. Let me consider that in natural units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c they become MeV. So perhaps.

But regardless, I think I can proceed with the numbers.

So x is about 29.78 MeV/c * c = 29.78 MeV. Wait, no, no, wait, no. Wait, x is p*c. So if x is in MeV, and p is in MeV/c, then x = p*c → units of MeV.

So with x being p*c, and we've got x ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, no, 8315.67 / 279.2 is about 29.78, correct. So x is approximately 29.78 MeV. So p*c = 29.78 MeV.

Now, let's find E_mu and E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = sqrt
