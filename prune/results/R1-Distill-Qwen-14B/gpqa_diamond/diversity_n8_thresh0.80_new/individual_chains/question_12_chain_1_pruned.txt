Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it through again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest initially, and we're told the rest masses of the pion and the muon. The options are A to D, each giving two energies, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. After the decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta, meaning their magnitudes are the same. 

Wait, but neutrinos are neutral and super light, right? Oh, but in some cases, like the pion decay, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So maybe I can approximate it as having zero rest mass? Or should I consider its actual mass? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume the neutrino is massless. That would make the problem easier.

So, to approach this, I should probably use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of those energies will be their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is much smaller, so maybe it's negligible? Or perhaps in this problem, the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero. Let me think. The pion's mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. So if the neutrino has negligible mass, then the available energy would be about (139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9 MeV. But wait, that's the rest mass difference. But since the pion is at rest, the decay products must have kinetic energy as well.

Wait, no, in the decay, the pion's energy is all its rest mass since it's at rest. So the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies
