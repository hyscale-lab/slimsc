Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to find out what compound X was from the options. 

Hmm, wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a base, maybe used for elimination reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, it's a reagent used for epoxide ring-opening, but I think more about the conditions. Wait, when epoxides are treated with certain bases, they can form different structures. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for some kind of rearrangement?

Wait, but the product is the result after reaction with this compound. Wait, usually 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used as a strong, bulky base. It's often involved in elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes or in the Hofmann elimination. Or maybe it's used in epoxide ring-opening under certain conditions. Hmm.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at that data. So the product doesn't have a formula given, but the starting material is C11H12O. Wait, but when you react with 1,4-diazabicyclo... which I think is a base, perhaps in a deprotonation. Or maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Alternatively, if the starting material is an epoxide, treatment with a base could cause ring-opening, but with what reagent?

Wait, let me think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR shows: 

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

And the 13C NMR has: 21.3 (s), 28.4 (s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 which is quite a high shift. That's usually a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. But wait, another possibility is an epoxide, but wait, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm, so 197 isn't that. So maybe a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product has a ketone or something like that.

Alternatively, wait, maybe an aldehyde? But 197 is more towards a ketone. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Like maybe two CH3 groups. Also, the aromatic region has four doublets and a couple more. Let me think: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). So that's like a para-substituted aromatic system with two substituents.

Wait, putting it together, maybe the product is an acyclic compound with a ketone and some methyl groups, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a styryl compound. Styryl implies a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. So, perhaps the starting material was an epoxide, and under basic conditions, it opened to form a diol, but then maybe underwent elimination to form a styryl structure.

But wait, what's the starting material? The options are all epoxides. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane (epoxide) with a 4-methylstyryl group. Structure would be a three-membered epoxide ring, with one oxygen, and attached to that is a styryl group which is a benzene ring with a vinyl group, and a methyl at the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the epoxide is
