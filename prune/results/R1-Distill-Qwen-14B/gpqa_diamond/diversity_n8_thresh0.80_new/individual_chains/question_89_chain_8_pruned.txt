Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to work through. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Let me start by figuring out each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. When you heat it with KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. But wait, dibromides usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so where would the double bond form? The positions are 1 and 3. Elimination would likely occur between these two positions, forming an allene (two adjacent double bonds?) or maybe a single double bond. Hmm.

Wait, when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) eliminate, they form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromo might not be vicinal. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane-like rings. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads, I think. So, when KOH is added, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene? Wait, no, the structure might have more than one bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicyclic compound.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it might undergo a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. So product 1 would be a diene, perhaps 1,3-adamantadiene.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound, maybe a ketone. Hmm, wait, but KOH as a base usually leads to elimination, not oxidation. Unless there's some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, maybe I got the first reaction wrong. Another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a Hofmann elimination, but that typically requires a strong base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder type reaction but with KOH as a base.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must be a ketone or an ester or something with a carbonyl group. So maybe the initial reaction is a ring-opening or some kind of oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's more likely that the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone. Or maybe a double elimination with formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Saytzeff elimination. Or maybe the di-bromide is treated with a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes
