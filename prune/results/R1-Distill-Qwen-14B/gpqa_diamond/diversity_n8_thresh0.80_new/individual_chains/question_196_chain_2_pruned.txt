Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says it's a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. And they're asking for the maximum speed, v_max, considering the relativistic effects since the speed of light is given as c.

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is achieved at the equilibrium position when the potential energy is fully converted into kinetic energy. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since this is relativistic, I guess we need to use the relativistic equations of motion or energy.

In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest mass energy and the potential energy, but wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (1/2)mv² classically. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, so the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) in the classical case is constant. But in relativity, I'm not sure if that's the case. Oh, but the problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because v is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy, plus the potential energy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential, and at x=0, all is kinetic.

So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Wait, no, I'm mixing up things. Because in the relativistic oscillator, the system's energy isn't just the sum of KE and PE as in classical mechanics. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the conservation of energy.

At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At x=0, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But wait, wait, in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at x=0 is (1/2)mv_max², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's non-relativistic.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². So the kinetic energy when the oscillator is at x=0 is the total energy minus the rest energy. Let me think.

Wait, the total mechanical energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the potential energy at maximum amplitude. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential is zero, so the energy is all kinetic,
