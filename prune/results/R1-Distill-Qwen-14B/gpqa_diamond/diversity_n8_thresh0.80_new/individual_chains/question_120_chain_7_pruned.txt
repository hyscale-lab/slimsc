Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density in space is the same everywhere. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy terms. Parallax, right. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance based on parallax is distance = 1 / plx, where plx is measured in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of, say, 0.1 parsecs, it's 10 parsecs away.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Oh, wait, so they want to know how the number of stars in a given slice of parallax changes as parallax changes.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is constant. Let's think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So in a certain volume, the number of stars is proportional to the volume.

But parallax relates to distance. So let's think about how the volume relates to parallax. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, right? So plx = 1/d. So a small plx means a large distance, and a large plx means a nearby star.

Wait, but how does volume depend on distance? Well, the volume of a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and you multiply by dr for the thickness.

So if I want the number of stars in a small range of parallax, I need to relate that to the volume. Let's say I take a thin shell between distance r and r + dr. The volume is 4π r² dr. But how does this relate to parallax?

Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr is the change in r corresponding to a change in plx. Let's compute dr in terms of d(plx). So plx = 1/r => r = 1/plx. Take derivative: dr = - (1/(plx)^2) d(plx). So d(plx) = - (plx)^2 dr. Hmm, but since plx is positive, and dr is positive (as r increases,
