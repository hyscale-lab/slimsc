Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I'm thinking is, okay, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Right? Because volume doubles, so concentration is original divided by 2.

Wait, wait. The initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 mL of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL or 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles. Then 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the next part is thinking about the titration process. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm. So first, let's figure out what's happening at 25% titration. I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me get the moles of acetic acid first.

The diluted solution is 0.025 M in acetic acid, and the volume is 0.04 L (40 mL). So moles of acetic acid = concentration * volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So, 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 25% of that is neutralized. So 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have reacted with NaOH. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025.

Wait, but how much NaOH solution is that? The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. But maybe the volume isn't needed right now.

So after the reaction, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) produced will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume now is the original 40 mL plus the NaOH added. At 25% titration, we added 2.5 mL, so total volume is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations now are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

But wait, maybe I should think about the buffer solution. Since we're only 25% into the titration, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) or wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So let's compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85)=0.267, so 0.267 -5 = 4.733. Wait, no: log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85)+log(1e-5)= 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately.

So in the Henderson equation, [A^-] is 0.00025 mol /0.0425 L = approx 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's roughly 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is pH 4.26; option D is 4.57. So that takes care of the first part.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. When we titrate 25% of the acetic acid, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1/3, right? Because for every 1 mole of acetic acid, 1/4 is neutralized, so [A^-] is 0.25, [HA] is 0.75. So the ratio is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3. So log(1/3)= -0.477. So pH is pKa - 0.477 → about 4.73 -0.477=4.253, which is about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dilution part. Let me recheck.

Original acetic acid: 20 mL of 0.05 M. Moles: 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 mL water, volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, moles reacted =
