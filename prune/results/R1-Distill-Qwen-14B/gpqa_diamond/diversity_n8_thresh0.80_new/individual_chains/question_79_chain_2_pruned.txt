Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound X from its NMR data after a reaction. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out which of the four options is correct.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Diels-Alder reaction. It's a diene, specifically a cyclic diene called a norbornene derivative. So when this reagent is used with another dienophile, it forms a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents, right? So the reaction here is a Diels-Alder reaction between compound X and the diene.

Wait, but wait. The structure of compound X might be an epoxide. Because the product from a Diels-Alder reaction with an epoxide as the dienophile would form a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe X is the dienophile, and the Diels-Alder forms a new six-membered ring.

Hmm, but looking at the options, all of them have an oxirane ring, which is an epoxide. So perhaps the Diels-Alder is between the epoxide (as dienophile) and the norbornene. Wait, no, more accurately, the norbornene is the diene, and the epoxide is the dienophile. So the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure with the epoxide oxygen now connected into the new ring.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at that.

The product's 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR shows:
- 21.3 (s)
- 28.4 (s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Wait, the 197.7 in 13C NMR is a carbonyl? Wait, no, 197 is more like a carbonyl group, but that's a high chemical shift. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide carbon. Wait, epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70 ppm. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's a carbonyl from a ketone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken, but maybe it's an aromatic carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the structures of the options to see which one would fit.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

So all are epoxides with styryl groups attached. Styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached, right?

Wait, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction converts the epoxide into a six-membered ring. Let me think about that. When an epoxide (oxirane) reacts in a Diels-Alder
