Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is often measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ). 

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to figure out the reaction when they're all mixed together. Wait, but waitâ€”how do they react? Because HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So maybe they all react with each other. Or perhaps, some might not react because they're in excess.

Let me think. The acids are HCl and H2SO4. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it's diprotic. So in aqueous solution, it first dissociates into H+ and HSO4-, and then the HSO4- can dissociate further into another H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base to form water.

But wait, how much H+ and OH- are present? I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, for HCl: 
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.
Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.
Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4.
This is a diprotic acid, so each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait a minute, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other in a 1:
