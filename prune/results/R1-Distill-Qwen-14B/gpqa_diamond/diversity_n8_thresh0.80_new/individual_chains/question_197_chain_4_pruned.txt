Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, A to D.

First, I'll start by looking at the spectral data provided.

The IR data shows strong peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the options don't seem to have amines, maybe it's O-H. Then there are peaks at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretches.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a broad peak might suggest some exchange, like in a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, another possibility is an acidic proton, like from a -COOH group. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals around 10-12 ppm. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, which would fit a para-disubstituted benzene. So maybe something like p-xylene or similar.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 2-3 ppm range. Maybe a CH next to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methylene next to something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet for two protons. Maybe part of a chain, like a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three protons. That's probably a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂ or something else. Wait, let me think. A doublet with 3H suggests it's attached to a CH group because the splitting comes from the neighboring group. Like in an isopropyl group, maybe.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons. That's usually a terminal CH3 in an alkyl chain, like an ethyl group or something longer.

Putting this together, maybe the aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is an ethyl group, considering the triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, ethyl group would have a triplet for the CH2 next to the CH3. But in the given NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which fits that. So perhaps a longer chain, but let's think more.

Wait
