Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to choose the correct kinetic energies from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum come into play. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That makes sense because their vector sum has to be zero.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very small (but non-zero) mass. Oh, but in many cases, especially in beta decay, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible. So maybe here, we can treat the neutrino as massless? Or at least, it's a common approximation. So the muon has mass 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino's mass is much smaller, so maybe we can ignore it for this problem.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's not moving. So energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. Or is it? Hmm, actually, the neutrino's energy is its total energy, which is kinetic plus rest mass energy. But since its rest mass is so tiny, maybe we can approximate its energy as just kinetic. Or maybe we should think differently.

Wait, no. The muon has both rest mass and kinetic energy. The pion's rest energy is all the energy available. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino must equal the rest energy of the pion.

So, the energy of the muon is its rest mass plus kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = K_nu, since m_nu is approximately zero.

So, energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

But wait, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. Let me denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

The energy of the muon is given by E_mu² = (p c)² c² + (m_mu c²)². Wait, no. Wait, the energy of a particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Right.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + (m_mu c²)^2 )

And E_nu = p c, since for a massless particle, E = pc.

So, putting it all together:

m_pi c² = sqrt( p² c² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Once I have p, I can find the kinetic energies of
