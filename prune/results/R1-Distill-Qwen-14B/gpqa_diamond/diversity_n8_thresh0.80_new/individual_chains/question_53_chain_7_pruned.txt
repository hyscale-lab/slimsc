Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, aromatic ring meaning it's something like benzene, right? Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The substituents could be groups attached to the benzene ring in two positions.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the IR peak for that would be around 1740 cm^-1 typically. Ester groups also have an -O- group and an -R-O-CO-O-R structure, but wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-R. So the presence of an ester suggests that one of the substituents on the benzene ring is an ester group, maybe something like OCOOR or similar.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break this down. The signals are categorized as two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups.

Hmm. So aromatic protons, vinyl protons, and methyl groups. Let's think about each part.

First, the aromatic-H part: two signals. That suggests that the two substituents on the benzene ring are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to be split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring might have two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. Wait, no, di-substituted benzene rings have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. If they are meta, maybe more splitting. Wait, wait, but di-substituted can be either para, ortho, or meta. Wait, but in the case of two substituents on benzene, the number of unique aromatic protons depends on their positions.

Wait, for di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if both substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets—like maybe two doublets. Or wait, no. Let me think: if substituents are para, the ring has two sets of two equivalent protons each, so that's two signals in the NMR. So that matches the two aromatic-H signals. So perhaps the substituents are in para positions.

Now, the substituents: one of them is an ester. Let's think about the other substituent. Wait, the problem says it's a di-substituted ring, so two substituents. One is an ester group, but what's the other? Well, let's look at the NMR signals.

There are two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds. So maybe one of the substituents is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH2 group or something else. But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Also,
