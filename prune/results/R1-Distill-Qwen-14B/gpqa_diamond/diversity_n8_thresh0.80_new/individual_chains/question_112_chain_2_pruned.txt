Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, first, maybe I should normalize this state because probabilities require it.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. The general way is to compute the inner product of the state with itself. Let me write that out.

The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 -i). So, to compute the normalization, I need |a|^2 + |b|^2. 

Calculating |a|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Oh wait, (1+i) times (1-i) is (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) → 1 -i +i -i². Since i² is -1, it becomes 1 + 1=2.

Similarly, |b|²: (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² → 4 +1=5. Because i² is -1, so 4 +1 is 5.

So the total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the given operator A. The matrix representation of A is A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, else 0. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, for a two-level system, the matrix would have 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0   ]

I think this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A would be the same, because scaling doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

Wait, but the problem says to find the probability of measuring the system in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are equal superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Let me write |+x> and |−x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, actually, the eigenstates for σ_x (and hence A) are:

For eigenvalue +1: (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
For eigenvalue -1: (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

But our operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 because A = (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

But the problem is about finding the probabilities, so perhaps it's sufficient to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> and find the coefficients.

So let me write |alpha> as a linear combination
