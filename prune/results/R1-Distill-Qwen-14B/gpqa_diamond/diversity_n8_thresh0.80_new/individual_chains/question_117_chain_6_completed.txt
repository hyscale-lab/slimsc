Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the given compounds can exhibit this.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

First, the compounds are numbered 1 to 4, and the options are combinations of these.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond. I think if the substituents on each phenyl ring are such that the whole molecule isn't symmetrical, the biphenyl might have some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have what's called a meso form or maybe some kind of cis-trans isomerism. Oh wait, optical isomerism is about chirality. So for the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So in this compound, there are nitro groups on each phenyl at position 6, and the other substituents are at positions 2. Let me visualize: each phenyl has a nitro at 6, which is para to the methyl ester. Wait, but are the two phenyl rings mirror images of each other? Or are they arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system allows for different configurations. If the two phenyl groups are connected in such a way that they can rotate around the single bond, but perhaps the substituents make the molecule chiral. Like if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. So maybe compound 1 has optical isomerism.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is something like CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl ester, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3CO(OH)CH2OCH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is HOCH2-COOCH3 attached to another CH3? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the carbon chain is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me imagine the structure. The central carbon (second carbon) has OH, COOCH3, CH3, and what else? Wait, the second carbon is connected to the third carbon, which is the COOCH3. So the four groups around the central carbon are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the first carbon, which is CH3). Wait no, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
4. and what's the fourth? Wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3) from the first carbon,
- an OH group,
- a carbonyl group (which is connected to OCH3),
- and the third carbon, which is a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, because the second carbon is CH(OH), and the third is COOCH3. So, the groups on the second carbon are:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and the C3 (which is the same as the COOCH3, so maybe that's just the same as the COOCH3 group? No, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)-? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the second carbon has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the third carbon (which is a carbonyl group). So for the second carbon, the four groups are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent carbon (which is part of the COO group).

Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is part of the COOCH3, but the second carbon is CH, so the groups are: CH3 (from the first C), OH, COOCH3, and the third C (which is like a carbonyl). Wait, no, the third C is the carbonyl, so perhaps in that case, the second C is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the third C (which is C=O).

Wait, but the third C is double-bonded to O, so it can't be connected to the second C beyond that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the central carbon (the second carbon) and whether it has four different groups.

If the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-, then the four groups around the second carbon are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent CH2 (if any?), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the hydroxy is on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, which is then connected to a COOCH3 group. So the three carbons are:

C1: CH3-

C2: -C(OH)-

C3: -COOCH3.

So the second carbon is connected to:

- C1 (CH3- group),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and C3 (the next carbon, which is a carbonyl group). Wait, but the C3 is part of the COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group. So the groups on C2 are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the C3, which is a carbonyl. But wait, the C3 is connected via a single bond to C2. So the group on C2 would be the C3, which is connected to O (double bond). So perhaps the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (C3). But the adjacent carbon is a carbonyl, but in terms of substituents, maybe that's considered as a carbonyl group. So the four groups around C2:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and a CH2COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think: the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOH, but since it's an ester, the COOH becomes a COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the middle one) has:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and the adjacent C (which is C3, which is connected to the carbonyl group). Wait, but in that case, the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the C3 (which is part of COOCH3). So, wait, does C2 have four different groups attached? Let me list them:

Group 1: CH3 (from C1).

Group 2: OH.

Group 3: COOCH3.

Group 4: The adjacent C3, which is connected to the carbonyl. But since the C3 is part of the COOCH3 group, perhaps it's considered the same as group 3? Hmm, no, because the adjacent C3 is connected to C2 but also to the carbonyl. So maybe the groups on C2 are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent C (which is connected to the carbonyl group). But wait, the adjacent C is the same as the C in the COOCH3. So perhaps the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH2 group? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the four substituents on C2 are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let me think: The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- and the adjacent carbon (from the right, which is the carbonyl carbon). Wait, but the carbonyl is double-bonded, so the adjacent carbon is the one with the O. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, the OH is on the same carbon as the ester group. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group? No, wait, it's a three-carbon chain. So C1: CH3-, C2: -CHOH-, C3: -COOCH3.

So C2 (the middle carbon) is connected to:

- C1 (CH3),

- OH,

- C3 (which is a carbonyl group),

- and the adjacent C (which is from the C3's COOCH3 group). But wait, that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent C (which is part of the COOCH3). Hmm, but maybe that's not four different groups. Because the adjacent C is part of the same group as COOCH3. So perhaps C2 has three substituents: CH3, OH, and the rest being a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to determine whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups, then it's chiral. Let's list the groups on C2:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and the adjacent carbon (which is the C of the COOCH3). But the adjacent C is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so perhaps that doesn't count as a substituent. Hmm, maybe the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another group, which is a single bond to the next carbon, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, but the next carbon is connected via a single bond to the C2, but it's part of the COOCH3 group. So, maybe the four groups are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and the adjacent CH2 group? No, that can't be because the chain is only three carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the groups are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen. But wait, in the structure, is there a hydrogen on C2? The formula is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, each carbon chain is:

C1: CH3-,

C2: -CH(OH)-,

C3: -COOCH3.

So C2 has:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from C3),

- and another CH (from C3's COOCH3? Or is that a single bond to C3, which is a carbonyl carbon?).

Wait, perhaps the C2 is connected to:

- C1 (CH3),

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another C (C3) which is a carbonyl group.

But the carbonyl is a double bond, so maybe the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent C, which is part of the carbonyl group. But that's a double bond, so maybe the substituent is the same as the COOCH3 group. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the four substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and a hydrogen. If that's the case, then the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That would make four different groups, so the molecule is chiral. So compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but in the structure I'm thinking, C2 is -CH(OH)-, so it's connected to C1 (CH3), OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Because in CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the middle carbon is CH(OH), so the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That's four different groups, so yes, it has a chiral center. So compound 2 is capable of optical isomerism.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ar)C(O)(Ar), where Ar is aryl (like phenyl). The structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. So the carbonyl is in the center. Now, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups: two aryl groups and the oxygen. Wait, but wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's only bonded to two R groups (two aryl groups), and the double bond. So the carbonyl carbon has two substituents: each aryl group is connected to the same carbon. So the molecule is symmetric around the ketone group. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and can't exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. The dimethyl ester would have two methyl groups attached to the two double-bonded carbons. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is the cis isomer, so the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3) connected via a double bond. Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH with both COOCH3 groups on the same side.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3
O

No, more accurately, it's:

     O
     ||
O=C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3
     O

Wait, no, fumarate is the cis isomer, so both COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not right because fumarate has a double bond. So it's actually:

CH2=CH with each CH2 replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, but in the trans configuration, the groups would be opposite, but in fumarate (cis), the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side.

But how does this relate to optical activity? Well, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some form of stereoisomerism like in allenes or other structures. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is achiral but has geometric isomerism.

Wait, but fumarate itself is an ester of maleic acid, which is the cis isomer. Wait, but does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's see. The central double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of these carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's (if it's cis, then both COOCH3 groups are on the same side). Wait, no, the structure is more like:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and another substituent. Wait, no, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. No, wait, the structure is (Z)-butenedioate, so it's:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH, each with a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In the cis configuration. So each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. But wait, wait. Let me get the structure right. Fumarate (cis-butenedioic acid) has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in the middle, so it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → actually, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. The ester would be where the -OH of the acid are replaced with OCH3. So the structure would be:

OCH3
   \
O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3
   /
   O

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen? Or perhaps each is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, that can't be. Wait, in fumarate, the two middle carbons are double-bonded, and each is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each of these carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So each of these carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached, which would make them each have two identical groups. So, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, which are same. So each of these carbons has two identical substituents (the COOCH3 groups), a double bond (so only three substituents in total). Wait, no, each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. So for each carbon in the double bond in dimethyl fumarate, substituents are:

- COOCH3,

- another COOCH3 (since it's cis, both are on the same side),

and the double bond. So each carbon has two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second: can a molecule without a chiral center exhibit optical isomerism due to some other form of stereoisomerism, like in allenes? Or perhaps through some other arrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate, in its cis configuration, would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait another moment: if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (like two COOCH3 groups), then the molecule is symmetrical. So the molecule isn't chiral either.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me rethink. If a molecule has a double bond with identical substituents on each carbon, it can't be chiral. For example, in an allene, if both ends are the same, it's not chiral. So in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely confident. Could there be another possibility?

Wait, no. Because in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So each of those carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, not chiral. Therefore, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, no, because in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same on each end. So the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of the molecule being a meso compound? Like tartaric acid, which has two chiral centers but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, there are no chiral centers because the central carbons are each bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3). So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so now compiling the results:

Compound 1: I'm not entirely sure, but I think it might have a chiral center or some form of stereoisomerism leading to optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Yes, it has a chiral center, so optical isomerism is possible.

Compound 3: No, because it's symmetric and has no chiral centers.

Compound 4: No, because it's symmetrical and has no chiral centers.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 1 might have a chiral center. Let me reevaluate compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So the structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and methyl ester groups (from the dicarboxylate) at 2 positions on each ring.

Wait, the formula is dimethyl, so each of the two carboxylate groups is a methyl ester. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a methyl ester (from the carboxylate) at position 2.

Now, the question is about stereoisomerism. Since the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, there can be rotation about that bond. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that their positions relative to each other create a chiral center, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the arrangement around the central single bond can lead to different isomers, but whether that leads to optical isomerism depends on whether the molecule is chiral.

So, if the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2 positions. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is para to position 2). So, each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate (as methyl ester) at 2. So, the two benzene rings are connected in a way that the substituents are in specific positions.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the two benzene rings can rotate around the central bond. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

But wait, in this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetrical? Because each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 6 and 2, respectively. So, for each ring, substituents are arranged in a way that might make the overall molecule symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But if the substituents cause the molecule to lack symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images of each other, then the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the central bond. If the substituents on each ring are placed symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral. So, in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So, for each ring, the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond. So, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when substituents are on adjacent positions, the molecule can lack a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the substituents are on the same positions (2 and 6) on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, hence, not chiral.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the ester groups are OMe, but those are on the benzene rings. The central bond is single, so the substituents are on the benzene rings. So, unless the central bond itself is a chiral center, which it isn't because it's a single bond and not a carbon, there are no chiral centers. Unless the arrangement around the central bond leads to a situation where the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider whether the molecule is symmetrical. If the two benzene rings are mirror images, then the molecule is achiral. But if the substituents on each ring prevent that, then the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about that. Another thought: if the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule have a non-superimposable mirror image. But given that each ring has the same substituents at the same positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, to sum up:

Compound 1: Not chiral, no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Chiral, yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So looking at the options:

The question asks which of the compounds show optical isomerism.

So, which options have compounds that exhibit optical isomerism?

Only compound 2 does.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me see:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no, 2 is yes.

Wait, so according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, which would mean none of the options exactly match. But that can't be right because the options must include the correct ones.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The two rings are connected by a single bond. Now, in such a structure, the substituents on each ring are in positions that are para to each other. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to each other. So, the two rings are mirror images of each other across the central bond. Thus, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility arises if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry. But in this case, they are arranged symmetrically, so the molecule is not chiral.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, none of the options A, B, C, or D say only 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no, 2 is yes.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake with another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each of the two carbons in the double bond, with both ester groups on the same side.

But wait, how does this affect the possibility of the molecule being chiral? For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on the double bond are such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it's chiral.

In the case of fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen (if I'm not mistaken). Wait, no: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So, it's actually CH2=CH, each with a COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would mean each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group on each end. So the structure would be:

     O
     ||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
     O

So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each carbon has one COOCH3 and another substituent. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, that can't be because that would require four substituents on each carbon. So, perhaps each carbon has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. But that doesn't make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, the correct structure would be each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and two H's, with a double bond between them. So, the structure is:

H2C(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that would imply each carbon has three substituents, which isn't possible. Alternatively, each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one H, making the structure:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

No, that's not right. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's better to consider that dimethyl fumarate is the cis diasteromer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, wait: actually, dimethyl maleate is the trans isomer, and dimethyl fumarate is the cis. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

In the cis configuration, both COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. Now, does this create a chiral molecule?

Wait, no because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3 and another group), but wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, each carbon is connected to one COOCH3 group and two H's, with a double bond. So, the structure would be:

H
|
C=C
| \
H   O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioate. So:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a CH2(COOCH3) group on each end. So each carbon has:

- two CH2(COOCH3) groups,

- a double bond,

- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that's not possible. Each carbon can have four bonds. So, each carbon in the double bond has:

- one CH2(COOCH3) group,

- another CH2(COOCH3) group,

- and two H's.

Wait, that would make each carbon have four substituents, but if they're part of a double bond, each would have two substituents and two H's. So the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups and two H's, making them each have four substituents.

But in reality, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=CH with each CH2 replaced by COOCH3. So the full structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In this case, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon has two identical substituents (COOCH3).

But wait, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two H's, which would make each carbon have four substituents. So each carbon would have:

- two COOCH3,

- two H's.

In this scenario, each carbon has two identical substituents (COOCH3), and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: if the substituents on each carbon are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options, none of them have only compound 2. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1, 2 and4 → 2 is correct, 1 and 4 are not. So A would be incorrect.

B) 3 and4 → No.

C) 2 and3 → 2 is correct, 3 is not.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is not correct, 2 is.

So, none of the options say only 2. Did I make a mistake in evaluating compound 1?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions.

Now, the biphenyl structure can have different configurations. If the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans), but in this case, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, leading to a symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of 6,6'-dinitro, the nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond, leading to a chiral arrangement. Wait, no, because each ring has a nitro group at 6, which is the same position relative to the connecting bond. So, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to chirality.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct approach is to conclude that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but according to the options, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism, but optical isomerism is about chirality. So, back to the compounds.

Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, the correct answer would be only compound 2. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B) 3 and4 → No.

C)2 and3 → No.

D)1 and2 → 2 is correct, 1 is not.

So, none of the options A-D include only 2. That's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (Z)-butenedioate. So, each ester group is on the same side of the double bond.

Now, in this structure, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? Or perhaps each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think: the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a CH2(COOCH3) group. So each carbon in the double bond has:

- two CH2(COOCH3) groups,

- a double bond.

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps each carbon has:

- one CH2(COOCH3) group,

- another CH2(COOCH3) group,

- a double bond,

- and another substituent, which would be a hydrogen.

Wait, that makes each carbon have four substituents:

- CH2(COOCH3),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- double bond,

- and H.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to add up. Each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents plus the double bond. So, perhaps each carbon has:

- two CH2(COOCH3) groups,

- a double bond.

No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon has:

- one CH2(COOCH3),

- a double bond,

- and two H's.

In that case, each carbon is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3), which would mean each carbon has two CH2(COOCH3) groups, a double bond, and two H's. But that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

In this structure, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two O-C-OCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical substituents (the O-C-OCH3 groups) and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical groups, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include an option with only 2, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: are there any cases where a molecule without a chiral center can exhibit optical isomerism?

Yes, in some cases, such as when the molecule has a plane of symmetry but is not superimposable on its mirror image. Wait, but that's not possible. No, a molecule without a chiral center can't exhibit optical isomerism. So, perhaps I'm correct that only compound 2 does.

But then, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I thought compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the biphenyl in compound 1 has a chiral axis. No, a chiral axis would make the molecule not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach. The question is which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. The correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me consider the positions again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, on each ring, the substituents are at the para positions. So, when the two rings are connected, the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical fashion. Thus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 does.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: perhaps it has a chiral center.

Wait, no. The structure has two carbonyl groups, and each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical groups (COOCH3) and two H's. Therefore, each carbon is not a chiral center because it's bonded to two identical groups. Hence, no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) is incorrect, and the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me check: could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is actually a diastereomer. No, without a chiral center, it can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different form of stereoisomerism, like being a meso compound. But in that case, it would be achiral.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a decision based on my analysis.

So, according to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options have this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A says 1, 2, and 4. I thought 1 and 4 are not correct, but perhaps one of them is.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me try to think differently. Suppose the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, the substituents are in positions that are para to each other on each ring. Now, when the two rings are connected by a single bond, the substituents could be arranged in a way that the entire molecule is not symmetrical.

For example, if the nitro groups on each ring are on the same side of the central bond, and the ester groups are on the opposite side, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but each ring has the nitro and ester in para positions, so when connected, the substituents are arranged in a way that they mirror each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But maybe it's not the case. Suppose the two rings are connected such that the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. In that case, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, which would make the arrangement symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but according to the options, that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But I don't think it does.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, making it achiral. Yes, that's possible. So, no optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in compound 4, the substituents are arranged differently. Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the two COOCH3 groups are on different sides, making it a trans configuration, which would be maleate, not fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is cis.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the cis isomer, so both COOCH3 groups are on the same side. So, in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the analysis.

Wait, another approach: looking for which options have compounds that can have optical isomerism.

Compound 2 definitely can. Now, perhaps compound 4 can as well. Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer but not a chiral center. Wait, no, without a chiral center, it can't be optically active.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think: perhaps the positions of the substituents on the biphenyl make the molecule not symmetrical, thus chiral.

Suppose the two nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond, and the ester groups are also on the same side. Then, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and be chiral.

In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Thus, perhaps compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in this case, the correct compounds are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I thought compound 4 doesn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another angle.

The question asks which show optical isomerism. So, which compounds have chiral centers.

Compound 2: has a chiral center, yes.

Compound 1: if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it would have a chiral center. For example, if the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

So, if the substituents on the two rings are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. So, compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 and 2 are correct. What about compound 4? No, I think it's not.

Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, the correct answer would be option D.

But earlier, I thought compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, another way: the biphenyl group can have a chiral arrangement. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a methyl ester at para positions. So, when connected, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the molecule unsymmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, but that's not the case here.

I'm getting stuck again. I think I need to make a decision based on the information I have.

So, the conclusion is:

Compound 2 has a chiral center → optical isomerism.

Compounds 1, 3, and 4 do not.

So, the correct answer should be only compound 2. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct compounds are 2 only. But the options don't include that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering geometric isomerism as optical isomerism, but that's not accurate. Optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometric isomerism.

Hmm. I think I'll have to settle on the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't include that, I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. In dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical groups, making the molecule symmetrical. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct compound is 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, 1 and 4 are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the cis isomer. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In the cis configuration. Now, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I think my conclusion remains that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I thought 1 and 4 are not correct.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time. Based on my analysis, compound 2 is the only one that exhibits optical isomerism. So, looking for which option includes 2 but not the others.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

Option D includes 1 and 2 → 2 is correct, 1 is not.

So, none of the options perfectly match.

But perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option A) 1,2,4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not certain.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism that lead to optical activity.

---

### **Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at position 6 and methyl ester groups at position 2 on each ring. The substituents on each ring are in para positions, and the molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on both rings. This symmetry ensures that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (C3). Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is capable of optical isomerism. Therefore, **compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 3: Benzophenone**

Benzophenone has the structure (Ar)C(O)(Ar), where Ar is an aryl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical aryl groups. This lack of asymmetry and the absence of any chiral centers make the molecule achiral. Therefore, **compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**

Dimethyl fumarate is the cis isomer of butenedioate, with the structure:

```
    O
    ||
O-C-OCH3
    \
      C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
```

In this molecule, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H). This symmetry ensures that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **compound 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: No optical isomerism (symmetric molecule).
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).
- **Compound 3**: No optical isomerism (symmetric molecule).
- **Compound 4**: No optical isomerism (symmetric molecule).

Among the options provided, **only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism**. However, none of the options explicitly match this conclusion. Based on the analysis, the closest option is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, but this includes compounds (1 and 4) that do not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this discrepancy, **A is selected as the answer**.

**Answer: A**
