The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Energy Difference Calculation**:  \n   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Using the relation \\( E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\), the energy difference is calculated as:  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta E = \\frac{12400 \\, \\text{eV\u00b7\u00c5}}{1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}} \\approx 8.57 \\, \\text{eV}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Boltzmann Equation**:  \n   The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right),\n   \\]  \n   where \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\( T \\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{6000}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{5500}} = \\exp\\left(\\Delta E \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)\\right).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Temperature Difference and Exponent**:  \n   The temperature difference term is calculated as:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000152 \\, \\text{K}^{-1}.\n   \\]  \n   The term \\( \\Delta E / k \\) is computed as:  \n   \\[\n   \\Delta E / k = \\frac{8.57 \\, \\text{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}} \\approx 99450 \\, \\text{K}.\n   \\]  \n   Multiplying these gives the exponent:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Exponent} = 99450 \\cdot 0.0000152 \\approx 1.5045.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Factor**:  \n   The factor is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\exp(1.5045) \\approx 4.5.\n   \\]\n\nAnswer: C"
