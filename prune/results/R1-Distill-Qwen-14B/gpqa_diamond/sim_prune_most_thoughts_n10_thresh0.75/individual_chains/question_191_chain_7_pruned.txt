Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound, and I need to determine the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. Hmm, let me think.

First, the starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Wait, let me draw that structure in my mind. So it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2), but wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2... Wait, no. Let me think of the structure. The substituent is at position 5 on the cyclohexane ring, and it's prop-1-en-2-yl. So the group is CH(CH2?) with a double bond. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)=? Oh, no. Wait, sorry, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see. Prop-1-en-2-yl group would be a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the group is CH2-C(CH2?) Wait, no. Let me think: the formula for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but
