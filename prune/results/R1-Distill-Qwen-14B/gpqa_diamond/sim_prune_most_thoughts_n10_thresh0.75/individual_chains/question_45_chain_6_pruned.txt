Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out each step.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the quantum number. Oh wait, the problem defines E as π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² E.

So E_n = n² * E.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Since they're spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, the quantum state depends only on the principal quantum number n, but since they are fermions, each can have a different spin. Oh wait, wait, spin-1/2 allows for two possible spin states. So for each n, we can have two fermions with opposite spins.

So the setup is that each energy level can hold two particles. Because for each n, you can have spin up and down. So for the ground state, we'll fill up the lowest energy levels with two particles each until we have four.

Let me think about the filling order. The ground state (lowest energy) would have the lowest possible n's, each holding two particles.

So the first energy level is n=1. That can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more, but wait, we have four particles. So n=1 and n=2 each hold two particles. So the energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. Each particle is in a specific state. But in the ground state, all the lowest possible states are filled. So for four particles, we'll have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and two in n=2 (each with opposite spins). Because each n can hold two.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, four particles, each with spin 1/2. So each n can have two particles
