Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction involves a different compound and some reagent treatment, followed by an acidic workup. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is asking how many peaks the chemist will observe in each chromatogram.

First, I need to understand each reaction and what products they form. Then, I'll think about the HPLC separations to determine the number of peaks.

Let me start with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH, followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. It's Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a powerful enough to reduce ketones, esters, amides, etc.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain. Let's draw it mentally. The ketone is on carbon 3, and there's a methoxy group on carbon 5. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3, but with a methoxy on carbon 5. So the positions are:

1 2 3 4 5 6
CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(=O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this compound, it's 5-methoxy, so the fifth carbon has a methoxy group. So, position 5 is the fifth from the first carbon.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, Reaction I is reducing this ketone. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, the ketone (at C3) will be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product after reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait a second, LAH is a strong reducing agent. For ketones, it would reduce them to secondary alcohols. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

After the acidic workup, I think that any excess reagents would be quenched, and any possible elimination reactions (if any) would be considered. But in this case, since we're just reducing a ketone, there's no elimination involved. So the product is a single secondary alcohol.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5? Or where is the stereocenter? Let me think: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is a ketone on C3, with a methoxy on C5. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)CH3.

Wait, actually, wait: the structure would have the methoxy on the fifth carbon. So the compound is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, the formula is hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is on C3. The compound is a six-carbon chain, with the ketone at C3. The 5-methoxy means that on C5, there's a methoxy group attached.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3
