Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Let's think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, the dot product implies that we're summing over the components. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, right? And n is a unit vector, so the sum of the squares of its components is 1.

Wait, what's the Pauli matrices' structure? Oh right, each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So σ · n is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by the components in each direction. But wait, the overall operator is multiplied by ε, which has the dimension of energy. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix.

Eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian... I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way here because the Pauli matrices have specific properties.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are traceless, and their square is the identity matrix. Because each Pauli matrix squared is I (the 2x2 identity matrix). So (σ · n)^2 would be (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)^2. Let me expand that.

Expanding the square: σ_x² n_x² + σ_y² n_y² + σ_z² n_z² + cross terms. But each σ_i squared is I, so the first three terms become (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So that's I.

What about the cross terms? They would involve terms like σ_x σ_y n_x n_y and so on. But wait, when you square a vector sum of terms, each cross term is 2 times the sum of the products. So, for example, 2σ_x σ_y n_x n_y + 2σ_x σ_z n_x n_z + 2σ_y σ_z n_y n_z.

But wait, I'm trying to find (σ · n)^2. Let me think: I can write it as (n · σ)(n · σ) = n · (σ · (n · σ))?
