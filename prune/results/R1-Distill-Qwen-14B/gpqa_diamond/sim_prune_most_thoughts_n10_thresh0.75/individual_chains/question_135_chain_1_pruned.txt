Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I need to figure out which decay channels are allowed based on the given Lagrangian and the mass of the boson. Let's think this through step by step.

The problem states that the interaction Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation might be a bit confusing. Oh right, I think the ψ_f(y) are fermion fields, and X is the boson field. So the term λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y) is probably the interaction term because when you expand it, you get terms involving X interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion pairs the X can decay into. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because in particle physics, the boson can't decay into particles whose combined mass is higher than its own. So for each possible decay channel, I'll have to check the masses of the fermion pairs.

Looking at the options, the possible decay products are various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses to check.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's recall their masses (approximate, in GeV):

Quarks:
- Up and Down (u and d): very light, about 2-5 MeV each. So for a pair, it's negligible compared to 6 GeV.
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV.
- Charm (c): around 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV.
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So any decay into top quarks is impossible because 2*m_t is way larger than 6 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV. Pair is negligible.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV. Pair would be 0.2 GeV, which is way under 6.
- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV. Pair would be about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, what about the quark pairs? Let me think: For a boson to decay into a quark-antiquark pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the boson's mass.

So for each option, let's check the decay possibilities.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So m_b *2 is 9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar would not be allowed kinematically. So option A is incorrect because it includes b bbar which is not allowed.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV <=6. So c cbar is allowed.

Tau is 1.77*2=3.54 GeV, allowed.

mu is 0.1*2=0.2 GeV, allowed.

e is even smaller. So all these are allowed. But what about the other quarks? s is about 0.1 GeV; 2*s is 0.2, which is allowed.

But wait, the other option C includes t tbar, which is impossible, so C is out.

So looking at the options, let's see which ones are allowed.

Wait, the problem also gives the interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term is proportional to X ψ_f ψ_f, which suggests that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → f fbar would be allowed for any fermion f that X couples to.

But wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again.

Wait, perhaps the term is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y). So the interaction is between X and a pair of fermions ψ_f. So, in other words, X can decay into any fermion
