Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. They dehydrated this acid to form an anhydride. Hmm, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. I remember that when you dehydrate a diacid, especially with a cis double bond, it forms an anhydride. The structure would probably have the two carboxylic acid groups connected through the double bond. So maybe it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, because if the alkene is cis, the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH wouldn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's more like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a single bond. Oh, wait, no. Maybe it's HOOC-CH2CH=CH-COOH, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's all single bonds. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis double bond somewhere in the chain. For example, maybe it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. No, wait, the starting point is a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in the chain. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's without a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. Hmm, maybe I should think about the product first.

The anhydride formed has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm. High upfield, but wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons. Wait, but
