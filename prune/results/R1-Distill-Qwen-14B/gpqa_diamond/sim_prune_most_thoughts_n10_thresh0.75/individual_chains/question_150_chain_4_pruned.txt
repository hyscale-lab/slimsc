Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it describes a series of reactions and asks for the final product from the options provided.

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data. Once I know the structure, I can track how it changes with each reagent.

Let's start with the NMR data. The protons are given as:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

Hmm, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So, the compound likely has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other signals: the doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 suggest some aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a doublet of 2H, maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. The 6.51 is also a doublet, which could be another set of aromatic protons, perhaps adjacent or part of a conjugated system.

The 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. Broad usually indicates something like an -OH group, but wait, this is a singlet. Maybe it's not an -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substituent causing a shift.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's around where CH2 groups next to oxygen might appear. So maybe a CH2-O group or something similar.

So putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and some oxygen-containing groups.

Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, and no X.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5 degrees. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (another double bond, so 1), and possibly an amine or something else. Wait, but N is here—so maybe an amide or amine group. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, perhaps it's a benzene ring, a carbonyl (like an aldehyde), and another double bond.

Wait, the NMR has the aldehyde. So that's one group. Let me imagine a structure with a benzene ring, an aldehyde, and perhaps some substituents.

Wait, the aldehyde is a triplet. So it's coupled with two other protons. Aldehydes usually have a singlet because they're at the end. A triplet might suggest adjacent to a CH2 group. Oh! Like RCH2CHO. So the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2, so it's a triplet. That makes sense.

So, the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group. Like CH2CHO.

Looking at the NMR triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is the aldehyde. The adjacent CH2 would be next, but where? Let me check the 3.66 ppm, which is a doublet for 2H. So the CH2 next to the aldehyde is probably attached to something else, maybe an oxygen. So it's OCH2CHO.

Wait, but then the 3.66 ppm would be the OCH2. So the structure might be something like OCH2CH2CHO. But that's not adding up to the molecular formula.

Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count. If the structure is something like benzaldehyde derivatives.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has two benzene rings. Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are two doublets each for 2H. That might suggest two para-substituted benzene rings. For example, two phenyl groups attached in a way that their protons are split into doublets.

Also, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an -OCH2- group. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That suggests that each of those protons is next to one other proton. So maybe it's a -CH2- group where each CH2 is connected to another CH, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's less likely. Alternatively, a -CH2-O- group attached to something else.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose there's a central chain: perhaps a four-carbon chain with some substituents. The aldehyde is at one end. Then, the next carbon has a CH2 group, which is connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Then, perhaps the rest of the carbons have substituents.

Wait, considering the NMR data, the 6.27 ppm (2H) could be a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to something else, but that's a double bond. But then the 9.72 would be an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: maybe the compound is a phenyl group attached to a chain with an aldehyde and some oxygen-containing group.

Wait, looking at the options, the products are different aldehyde derivatives. So the starting material is perhaps an amine or a nitro compound, reacting through diazotization.

Wait, the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for making diazonium salts, typically from aromatic amines. Then, the second reagent is water, which under certain conditions can lead to hydrolysis. The third is aqueous KOH with heat—maybe a hydrolysis or elimination reaction.

So, perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group. Let me think about that.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the structure has an aromatic amine (like aniline), then the formula is C7H9N plus the rest. Wait, C8H9NO: so perhaps an aniline derivative with another group.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR again. The 9.72 ppm is an aldehyde. So maybe the starting material has an aldehyde and an amine group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an amino group which is going to be transformed.

Wait, the NMR doesn't show any
