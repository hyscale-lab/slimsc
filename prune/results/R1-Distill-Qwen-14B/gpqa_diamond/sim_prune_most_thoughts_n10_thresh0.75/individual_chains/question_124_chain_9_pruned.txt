Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, particles are being collided in a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced. These new particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, the original situation is Lorentz factor gamma = 20, and only 1/3 make it. We need to find a gamma where 2/3 make it.

Wait, I think it's related to the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. Because if they decay before reaching the walls, they won't be detected. So the problem must be about the particles' lifetime as observed from the lab frame. 

In high-energy physics, particles with a short lifetime (like certain mesons) can travel further than expected because of time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles are moving at a speed close to the speed of light, so their average speed is approximately c. So the distance they can travel before decaying is speed multiplied by lifetime. Which is approximately c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius, which is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, its gamma must be such that the product c * gamma * tau is at least 30 meters.

But wait, the initial situation says that with gamma = 20, only 1/3 of the particles reach the walls. That suggests that in that case, the average distance they travel is less than 30 meters, but 1/3 of them manage to do so. Or perhaps, it's about the time it takes for the detector to observe the decay products. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, since the particles are moving at speed v â‰ˆ c, their time to reach the wall is t = R / v
