Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, and when charges move, the fields change. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t. The field is generated at an earlier time tr, and the vector d is from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r. Oh right, because electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, so the field we see at time t is due to the charge's state at tr, where tr is t minus the time it took for the field to travel from there to here. So tr = t - (distance)/(c), but I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. So we need expressions for V and A at time t. The options involve different expressions, so I need to recall the correct formulas for potentials in this scenario.

I remember that the scalar potential V for a static charge is (q)/(4πε0 r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, this might change? Or does the static formula still hold for V? Wait, no, because when the charge moves, the potentials might depend on the motion.

Wait, no, wait. The scalar potential for a moving charge depends on the relative velocity. Because the electric and magnetic fields are affected by motion. Oh right, the scalar potential is still V = q/(4πε0 r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. Wait, but in this problem, r is the position of the observation point. Hmm, but the charge is moving, so the distance isn't just r. Oh, wait, the vector d is from the retarded position to r, so the distance is d, perhaps.

Wait, the problem says that d is the vector from the field generating point (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the length of d is the distance between them. So the distance is |d| = |r - s(tr)|, assuming s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

So for the scalar potential, V would be (q)/(4πε0 d), but wait, option B's V is like that. But wait, let me think again. 

Wait, when the charge is moving, the scalar potential at a distant point is still given by the static formula, because the scalar potential doesn't transform in a way that depends on motion. Or does it? No, wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge might have the same form as the static case but evaluated at the retarded position. So the scalar potential V would be (q)/(4πε0 d), where d is the distance between the charge at time tr and the observation point r.

But looking at the options, option B has V as (q)/(4πε0 r), which seems to be the static case where the charge is at the origin. But wait,
