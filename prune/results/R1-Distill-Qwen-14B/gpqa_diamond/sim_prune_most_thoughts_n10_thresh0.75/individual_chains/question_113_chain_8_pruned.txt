Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, the question gives me three main pieces of data: the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry results. The possible chemical formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more characteristic of an alcohol. Or maybe a ketone? No, ketones usually have a peak around 1700. Oh wait, the other peaks in FTIR are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, but could that be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in conjugated systems) or maybe another carbonyl group? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an amide, but I don't see any N in the formula, so probably not an amide. Hmm, but the options don't have N, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the other thing I remember is that a peak around 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. Like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. But wait, the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond somewhere. So maybe it's an enone or something with a conjugated system.

Looking at the H NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH- or similar. So the compound has a double bond, probably adjacent to something else, maybe near an oxygen. So maybe an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond nearby. Or maybe a diene, but I'm not sure.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. Well, 45 could be (CH₂O)₂, but wait, that's 45? Let me calculate. CH₂O is 30 (12+2+16). Oh wait, 45 is 30 plus 15? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is the mass number. So the fragment could be something like (CH3)CO, which is 59? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's the CH₂O group with some addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43. Close, but not 45. Wait, 45 is 45 amu. Let me think of possible fragments.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+, which is (45). Let me calculate: (CH3)2CO is (2*(15) for CH3) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 30 + 12 +16= 58? No, that's not right. Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a formula of C3H6O. The molecular weight is 58. So that fragment would be 58, but the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2O plus something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a carbonyl group with a methyl and another group. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)CO+ which is 43 (12*2 + 1*5 +16= 24 +5 +16=45? Wait, wait, (CH3)CO+ would be (12*2) + (1*3) +16 +1 (from the + charge?), no, wait. Let me do this more carefully.

The molecular formula of (CH3)CO+ would be C2H3O. Molecular weight: (2*12) + (3*1) + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. But the fragment is at 45. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO?), but that's similar to the above. Alternatively, maybe a fragment with a CH2 group and an O. Wait, perhaps a methyl group and
