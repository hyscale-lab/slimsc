Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals a mass number of 6. So nucleus X is Li-6.

I remember that relativistic energy calculations involve the gamma factor. The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, so gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The speed v here is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma formula. So v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me calculate that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me make sure I did that right. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5714 is correct since 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1.

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Li has an atomic number of 3. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. The mass of a single nucleon is approximately the mass of a proton, which is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, for a more precise calculation, I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, I can calculate the mass of Li-6 using the individual masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Wait, but wait, the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Electrons are part of the atom, not the nucleus. So for the nucleus, the mass is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the approximate mass of a Li-6 nucleus in MeV/c².

The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². Neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that.

3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV/c²
3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV/c²
Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV/c²

Wait, but that's the sum of individual nucleon masses. However, the actual mass of the nucleus is less due to binding energy. But for such a problem, unless stated otherwise, I think we're supposed to use the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, ignoring the binding energy. Or wait, perhaps the question expects us to use the atomic mass, but considering that the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 electrons... Wait no, because the nucleus doesn't include the electrons. So maybe the approach is to take m = 6 * m_nucleon, but what
