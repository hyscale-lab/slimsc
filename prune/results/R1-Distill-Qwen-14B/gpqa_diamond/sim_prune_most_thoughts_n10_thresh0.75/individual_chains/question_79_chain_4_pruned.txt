Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify what compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes through the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Wait, no, wait. Or is it used in ring-opening reactions? Oh wait, no—maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, no, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's used in the Hofmann elimination, but in this context, maybe it's acting as a base in an epoxide ring-opening? Or perhaps it's involved in some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the reaction conditions include a nonpolar solvent and high temperature (403 K is about 130°C). So nonpolar solvent might mean that the reaction is not acid-catalyzed since polar solvents like water or alcohols are more typical for acid conditions. So maybe it's a base-induced reaction. What reactions involve bases like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane?

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used acid in some reactions? No, wait, no, that's more like H2SO4 or something. Oh, wait, wait, no, the base part: 1,4-diaza... is a base because it can accept protons. So maybe it's used in deprotonation steps.

But the reaction is with compound X. The product's NMR is given, which includes both 1H and 13C NMR data. So the product must have a different structure than X. So, what's the transformation happening here?

Let me think about the options. The options for compound X are four epoxides, perhaps? Because the product has an epoxide structure, maybe?

Wait, the starting material is compound X, and the product is derived from X. So what could X be?

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

That's an oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group substituted at the 2 position, and the styryl group has a methyl at the para position.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So the oxirane has a substituent which is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl. The structure would be something like a substituted cyclopropane ring with a double bond.

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

So the oxirane ring has a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group (vinyl benzene) at position 3.

D) 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, that's the same as option A? Or different. Wait, 2-styrylepoxide would have the styryl group attached to the epoxide's oxygen? No, wait, no. Styryl is a vinyl benzene group. So 2-styrylepoxide is an epoxide with a styryl group attached to one of the oxygen's carbon atoms—probably the 2-position.

Wait, but let me get this straight. Styryl is an arylvinyl group. So in 2-styrylepoxy, the epoxide is between two carbons, say C1 and C2. The C2 is attached to a phenyl group via a double bond (C=C-Ph).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what each option's structure would look like.

Let me think about the product's NMR. The product's 1H NMR shows:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), so a singlet for 3H, probably a methyl attached to something deshielded, maybe a carbonyl or an electronegative atom.

Another singlet at δ2.31 (3H, s), another methyl. So two methyl groups as singlets. Wait, but the molecular formula of compound X is C11H12O. So, the product would have the same formula? Or is it different? Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo... but I'm not sure of the stoichiometry. Wait, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation, so X is a diene or something, and the product is an epoxide.

Wait, no, in the options, all are epoxides. So perhaps X is an epoxide, but the product is something else. Or maybe X is a diene that is epoxidized into an epoxide.

Wait, the problem says that the theoretical NMR of the resulting product is given. So X is reacting to form another compound, which is the product. So the product is not an epoxide? Or is it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the product's NMR data:

1H NMR signals:

- 2.28 (3H, s): probably a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Or perhaps attached to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl adjacent to an aromatic ring but in a symmetric position.

- 2.31 (3H, s): another methyl group, possibly in a similar environment.

Then, aromatic signals:

6.75 (1H, d): could be a proton adjacent to a substituent on an aromatic ring.

7.08 (2H, d): possibly two protons that are equivalent, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene.

7.68 (1H, d): another proton in an aromatic environment.

7.71 (2H, d): two equivalent protons, perhaps adjacent to substituents.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the integration is 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe the aromatic region has a pattern of two doublets
