Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6. Because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ⁶Li.

Now, I need to find the energy of the collider. Wait, energy in particle physics usually refers to kinetic energy or total energy? Hmm, in colliders, it's usually the kinetic energy that's given, but sometimes problems refer to total energy, so I'll need to clarify.

The speed given is 0.96c. So beta (β) is 0.96, and gamma (γ) is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute that first. Let's calculate β²: 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but wait: 0.28 is 0.28, so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So gamma is roughly 3.5714.

Now, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ * m₀ * c². Wait, but wait, what's m₀ here? It's the rest mass of the nucleus.

So I need to find the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². Since ⁶Li has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait, actually, the binding energy of the nucleus would cause the actual rest mass to be slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons. But I think for this problem, they might be ignoring the binding energy and just using the sum of individual nucleon masses. Or maybe I'm supposed to use the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, another approach: look up the exact rest mass of ⁶Li. I'm not sure if I can do that, but perhaps I can approximate. Wait, I remember that the mass of a deuteron (²H) is about 1875 MeV/c², but that might not help here. Another way: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.
