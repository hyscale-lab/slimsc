Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1 / (distance in parsecs). Or wait, wait, let me think again. Oh, right, the formula is distance in parsecs (d) = 1 / parallax (plx). So if plx increases, the distance decreases, because if plx is bigger, the star is closer.

So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that means plx is inversely proportional to d. So plx = 1/d. Therefore, 1/plx would be d. Let me substitute that into the equation.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 → which is N ∝ d^5. Wait, wait, wait. Let me do the algebra right. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So 1/(plx)^5 = (1/plx)^5 = (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Oh, so N increases as d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, because when we count stars, we're looking at how many there are in a certain volume. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the number of stars varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So does that mean that for a given parallax (i.e., a specific distance), the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5?

I think I should model this as the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance. Because when you look at the sky, you can consider stars in thin shells of distance. So the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr would depend on the density of stars at radius r multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, but the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r (distance), then 1/plx is r. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, does that make sense in terms of volume? Because the volume of a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in the shell is proportional to r^5, that would imply a density that increases with r^3, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying things by considering that the number of stars in a unit range of distance (per unit r) would depend on how the density changes. Let me think.

If the number of stars (N) in a given region (like a unit of solid angle) is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5 (since plx =1/r), then for each shell at radius r, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, the number of stars per unit volume would be the number density, which is N divided by the volume of the shell.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the number of stars per
