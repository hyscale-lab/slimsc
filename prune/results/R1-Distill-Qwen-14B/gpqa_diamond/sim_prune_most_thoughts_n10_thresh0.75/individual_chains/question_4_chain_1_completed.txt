Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. So how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall them. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law for electricity. The second is about the curl of the electric field, Faraday's law of induction. The third is Gauss's law for magnetism, and the fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition for displacement current.

In our world, the magnetic field's divergence is zero. That comes from the third equation, ∇·B = 0. This is because magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if in this parallel universe, they do have isolated poles, that equation must change. Because if you have monopoles, the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore.

Wait, but the question says Maxwell's equations look different. So which equations are different? Let me think. The third equation is definitely different because it's about the divergence of B. But are there others? Let me check the other equations.

The first equation is about the divergence of E, which relates to charge density. That probably stays the same if only magnetic monopoles are introduced. The second equation is about the curl of E, which is related to changing magnetic fields. That also might not change because the existence of monopoles wouldn't directly affect the relationship there. Unless... wait, no, Faraday's law is more about the induced electric fields due to changing B fields. If B's divergence isn't zero, does that affect Faraday's law? Hmm, maybe not directly.

Wait, but Maxwell's equations might get an additional term if magnetic monopoles exist. I remember that if magnetic monopoles exist, there would be a dual to Gauss's law for magnetism. So perhaps the fourth equation, Ampère's law, would also change. Because in our equations, the curl of B is μ₀ times (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). But if there's a magnetic current or something, maybe the curl of B would have another term.

Oh right, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So ∇·B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. That changes the third equation.

But what about Ampère's law? In the standard equations, the curl of H is J + ∂D/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, maybe there would be a magnetic current density term on the right side. So perhaps the fourth equation would have a term for the divergence of E or something else? Wait, no, ∇×B would include a term related to the magnetic current.

Wait, let me think. Without monopoles, ∇·B =0. But with monopoles, ∇·B = rho_m. Also, in Ampère's law, the curl of B would have a term involving the magnetic current density. So the fourth equation would change. So which equations are modified?

So our universe: Maxwell's equations have:

1. ∇·E = rho/epsilon_0

2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

3. ∇·B =0

4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

In a universe with monopoles, equation 3 would become ∇·B = rho_m (where rho_m is the magnetic charge density). And equation 4, which is Ampère's law, would also change. Because in Ampère's law, the curl of B would have a term for the magnetic current. So equation 4 would become ∇×B = mu_0 (J_m + epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t ), perhaps? Or something along those lines. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Alternatively, I've read that if magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So the divergence of E would relate to electric charge, divergence of B to magnetic charge, the curl of E relates to the time derivative of B, and the curl of B relates to the electric current plus the time derivative of E (as before) plus any magnetic current terms.

Wait, I think the modified equations would be:

∇·E = rho_e / epsilon_0

∇·B = rho_m / mu_0

∇×E = -∂B/∂t

∇×B = mu_0 ( J_e + epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + J_m )

Wait, maybe not exactly. Another thought: the existence of magnetic monopoles would add terms to the Ampère-Maxwell law. So the fourth equation would have a term for the magnetic current density, similar to how the displacement current accounts for the time derivative of E.

So in this scenario, both the third equation (divergence of B) and the fourth equation (curl of B) change. Because in the third, it's no longer zero, and in the fourth, you have an additional term related to magnetic current.

So looking back at the question, the options are about which equations are different. The options are:

A) divergence of B.

B) circulation of E and divergence of B.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.

So just equation 3.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

So equations 2 and 3.

Option C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.

Wait, flux is about divergence, not curl. Hmm, perhaps this is about Faraday's law (which is curl E) and Ampère's law (curl B). So if both change, then option D would be about divergence and curl of B. Let me look.

Option D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.

Ah, that's equations 3 and 4. Because equation 3 is divergence of B, and equation 4 is curl of B.

Wait, but equation 4 is about the curl of B, which in our universe is related to J and ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would have an additional term, perhaps a term involving the magnetic current. So both equation 3 and equation 4 would change.

So the question is, which equations are different? The answer would be the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field, which is option D.

Wait, but in the question, the options are multiple. Let me recap:

Option D says: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.

So equations 3 and 4.

Yes, because both the divergence of B (equation 3) and curl of B (equation 4) change when magnetic monopoles exist.


In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from their standard form in our universe. In our universe, the third equation, ∇·B = 0, holds because magnetic monopoles are not observed. If magnetic monopoles exist, this equation would change to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Additionally, the fourth equation, which relates the curl of B to the current densities, would also change. Specifically, the curl of B would include a term involving the magnetic current density, making the equation symmetric to the form of the third equation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This refers only to the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B). While this equation does change, the fourth equation (∇×B) also changes, so this option is incomplete.
- **Option B**: This refers to the circulation of the electric field (∇×E) and the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B). The circulation of the electric field remains unchanged, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: This refers to the circulation of the magnetic field (∇×B) and the flux of the electric field. The flux of the electric field is related to Gauss's law for electricity, which remains unchanged, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: This refers to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field (∇·B and ∇×B). Both of these equations change in the presence of magnetic monopoles, making this the correct option.

Thus, the equations related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field are the ones that differ in this scenario.
