Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, right? The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps, so the pressure is really low. Even with that, some gas particles remained, and he measured the mean free path as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that from my studies.

Now, when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed a change in the mean free path to λ2. The temperature stayed the same, so that shouldn't affect the mean free path. Wait, what affects the mean free path? Oh, right, it's related to pressure, molecular diameter, and temperature. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure hasn't changed because the pumps are running, right? So the pressure is still the same as before when he measured λ1. So why did λ change?

Oh, maybe because the electron beam is causing some effect. Like, when the beam is on, it could be ionizing the gas molecules or something. If the gas particles get charged, they might interact differently with the electron beam. But how does that affect their movement?

Wait, if the gas molecules are charged, they might start scattering more or less. Or perhaps the electron beam is causing them to move in ways that change their effective cross-section for collisions.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the chamber walls or other structures, thus changing the mean free path. But wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the density of gas particles. If the beam somehow affects the distribution or movement of the gas, maybe the effective pressure changes, but the actual pressure doesn't.

Wait, but the pressure is the same because the vacuum pumps are maintaining it. Hmm. Another thought: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. So, if pressure P is the same, λ should remain the same. But Mike is seeing a change. So maybe there's another factor.

Wait
