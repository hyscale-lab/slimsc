Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let's try to work through it step by step.

The setup is that they've done an experiment with white lupine and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants—so each gene is not functional—and also double mutants. The idea is to figure out how these genes interact, especially since one of them is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

The data given is about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100% resistance. The mutants have varying percentages: g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests a possible epistatic relationship. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if g1g2 has 0% resistance, same as g2, that might mean G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of a non-functional G2 is masking the effect of G1.

Looking at the data:

- g2 alone has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the fungus at all. That suggests G2 is really important. Maybe it's a transcription factor, as stated in the question, since it's acting upstream.

- Now, the double mutants: 

g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's the same as just G2 being knocked out. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Because the phenotype of the double mutant matches the single mutant of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So when G2 and G3 are both knocked out, it's same as just G2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

What about g1g3? That's 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So the double mutant is more susceptible than either single. That suggests an additive effect, maybe? Or perhaps the genes are in the same pathway but not epistatic to each other.

Wait, but when two genes are in the same pathway and their disruption leads to a more severe phenotype, that's additive. So if G1 and G3 work in the same pathway and their products contribute additively, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone.

Alternatively, if they were redundant (like backup genes), their knockout together would be worse. But redundancy usually implies that each can compensate for the other. So when both are gone, the effect is more severe.

In the question, it's stated that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. Since g2 is completely lost, and in double mutants with g1 and g3, the resistance drops to 0%, it suggests that G2 is that transcription factor.

So let's think about each gene's role:

G2 is likely the transcription factor because when it's knocked out, resistance is 0. Also, in the double mutants with G2 and another gene, the resistance is also 0, meaning G2's function is upstream. So G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and G3.

Wait, no, actually, since the double mutants have 0, which is same as G2, that means that without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, the resistance is gone. So G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So G2's product is required for the function of G1 and G3.

So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, perhaps. Because if that's the case, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of both G1 and G3.

But let's look at the single mutants:

g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, the plant is less resistant than wild-type but not completely susceptible. So maybe G1 is part of a redundant pathway, or it contributes to a subset of the resistance mechanisms.

g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is halved compared to wild-type.

Now, when you have g1g3, their resistance is 10%—so way lower than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's much worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their function is additive. Because, in the presence of G2 (the transcription factor), both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance. So if both are knocked out, their combined absence leads to a more severe phenotype.

Wait, but why doesn't the double mutant g1g3 have 25% (which is 75% minus 50%? No, that's not additive percentages. Let's think about it differently. The wild-type is 100. So if each gene contributes a certain amount:

Wild-type: 100.

g1: 75. So G1 contributes 25.

g3: 50. So G3 contributes 50.

But when both are knocked out (g1g3), it's 10. So that's much less than the sum of 75 + 50 = 125, but that's not the right way to add. Maybe they are acting in parallel pathways. So the total resistance is the sum of the individual contributions, but each can't exceed 100.

So, if G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable both, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the mutants without G2, like g1 or g3, their resistance is lower but not zero. Because G2 is still present but not functional in g1 and g3? Wait, no. Wait, in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is functional. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in g1, G2 is present but G1 is not. So G3 would be expressed. So in g1, G3 is functional.

But in g1, the resistance is 75%—so with G3 present, why isn't it 50% (the level of g3)? Because G3 gives 50%, as in g3.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. So in the wild-type, both G1 and G3 are functional. G1 contributes 25 (from g1: 75, so 100-75=25), and G3 contributes 50 (from g3: 50, so 100-50=50). So total is 75 from G1 and G3? Wait that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the two genes contribute to the same pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of two separate pathways that contribute to the same phenotype. So when you knock out G1, you lose 25% of the resistance, and when you knock out G3, you lose 50%. So together, you lose 75%, giving 25% resistance. But the observed resistance in g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than that. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. That would explain why in any mutant that includes G2 being knocked out (g1g2, g2g3, g2g1g3), the resistance is 0.

In the single mutants, g1 is 75%, which suggests that G1 is not required for full resistance. Or maybe G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So, in g1, G3 is still present, which contributes 50% resistance. Wait, but g1 is 75%—so higher than G3's 50%. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G2 is not a transcription factor for G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for both, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is present and functional. So G3 should be expressed, which would give 50% resistance. But g1 is 75%. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of each gene's effect. The wild-type is 100% resistance.

g1: 75% ⇒ So without G1, resistance is 75%. So G1 contributes 25% to the resistance.

g2: 0% ⇒ Without G2, no resistance. So G2 is absolutely essential.

g3: 50% ⇒ Without G3, resistance is 50% ⇒ G3 contributes 50%.

Now, looking at double mutants.

g1g2: 0% ⇒ same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the presence of a non-functional G2, the phenotype is the same as when G2 is alone. So the presence of G1 doesn't matter if G2 is not working. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g1g3: 10% ⇒ lower than either single, which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute additively. Because 75 (g1) + 50 (g3) would be 125, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of both G1 and G3 leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. So their contributions are additive but in the same pathway. So without both, you lose 25 + 50 = 75, giving 25% resistance. But wait, the observed is 10%. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe there's an interaction beyond simple addition.

g2g3: 0% ⇒ same as g2. So G2 is epistatic over G3 as well.

So, this suggests that G2 is the transcription factor, and both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

Wait, but why is g1 75% and g3 50%? Because in their absence, some other gene (maybe G2 is still present in g1 and g3) is providing the remaining resistance.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. But in the single mutants, g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 50% (from G3). But the data says g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates another gene or a different pathway. But the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others, which fits with G2.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2. So if G1 is knocked out, the other pathway (G3) is still active, providing 50% resistance. But the data says g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%—so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G2 is required for G1, but G3 is not. So in g1, G3 is still active. If G3 contributes 50%, and G1 contributes another 25%, then without G1, you have 50% (from G3). But the data for g1 is 75%, so that's not matching.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try another angle. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream of both.

So G2's function is upstream, and both G1 and G3 are downstream. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't contribute anything, hence 0% resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1: G2 is present, so G2 is active. So G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 50% (from g3), but the data says 75%. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the model is that G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3. So in g1, G3 is still expressed (since G2 is present). So the resistance should be same as in g3. But in reality, it's higher. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe it's not a direct regulation. Perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant system. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

But the options mention things like transcription factors, pleiotropy, epistasis, and gene redundancy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But in our data, G2 is the one that is epistatic. So if G2 is epistatic towards G1, which would fit the data.

But the question states that at least one is a TF. So if G2 is a TF, then that fits.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in our data, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, gene redundancy would imply that both G1 and G3 can perform the same function. So if you knock out both, the effect is worse than either single.

Wait, in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that fits with redundancy. If G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

But then why is g1 75% and g3 50%? Because in g1, G3 is present but may not be fully functional, or perhaps each contributes a certain amount.

Wait, another thought: if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their products work in parallel, then the loss of each contributes a part to the overall resistance. So perhaps the total resistance is G1 + G3.

But in the data, g1 is 75%→ so without G1, G3 is 75% (but that's higher than the g3's 50%). Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps without G2, the pathway is not functional. So G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3.

In the single mutants:

- g2: 0% → G2 is knocked out, so neither G1 nor G3 is expressed.

- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, giving 50% resistance. But the data says g1 is 75%—so that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF for a different gene, not G1 and G3. Because in that case, knocking out G2 would disable that other gene, but G1 and G3 are in a different pathway.

But the data shows that when G2 is knocked out (in g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, which suggests that G2's pathway is the only way to get resistance.

So maybe G2 is a TF for a gene that is necessary for resistance. But the other genes (G1 and G3) are not involved in the same pathway.

Wait, but in that case, why would the double mutants g1g3 be 10%? That's a very low resistance, but not 0. Maybe they contribute to a minor pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, but each gene also has a separate function. So if G2 is absent, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if G1 is absent, G3 is expressed (from G2's TF activity), giving 50% (as in g3). But g1 is 75%, which is higher than 50%, so that doesn't fit.

This is getting complicated. Let's think about the options.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, G2 is a TF, which might mean it's activating another gene, but perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant. If they are redundant, knocking both out would cause a more severe phenotype than either alone.

In our data:

g1: 75%

g3: 50%

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either. So that fits redundancy. So the two genes contribute to the same function, and without both, the phenotype is worse.

But why is g1 75% and g3 50%? Since they are redundant, knocking either out should have the same effect, but here they're different. So that might not fit.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But how does that apply here?

Alternatively, maybe G2 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their loss leads to the same phenotype. But in the data, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, so they don't have the same effect. So maybe not pleiotropy.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in our data, G2 is epistatic towards both G1 and G3. So option C doesn't fit.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would imply they're co-regulated. But I don't see how that directly affects the data.

Wait, same promoter—so knocking out G1 would also affect G3? But in the data, g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%. So they are expressed independently. So that's probably not the case.

So, let's go back. The key points from the data:

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is same as g2.

- G1 and G3 have additive effects. Because when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, worse than either alone.

So, G2 is a transcription factor which is upstream of both G1 and G3, meaning G2's product is required for the expression of G1 and G3. So when G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 are expressed. 

In the single mutants:

- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance should be same as g3, 50%. But the data says 75%. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps G2 isn't the TF for G1 and G3. Maybe G2 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that controls another gene, say X, which is necessary for the resistance. So without G2, X isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. G1 and G3 may be part of a different pathway that only partially contributes to resistance.

In this scenario:

- g2: no X → 0%

- g1: X is present → so some resistance, but lower than wild-type. Maybe G1 is part of a separate pathway that adds to the resistance. So without G1, the resistance is 75% (so X is providing 75%, perhaps.)

- Similarly, g3: X is present, providing 100% normally, but without G3, it's 50%. So G3's pathway contributes 50% of the resistance.

But if X is responsible for 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), that doesn't make sense because X's effect should be the same regardless of G1 or G3.

Alternatively, perhaps X's pathway is 100%, and G1 and G3 are part of a separate pathway that contributes to the resistance. So without G2, the X pathway is gone, leading to 0%. But with G2, X is active, and G1 and G3 may add to the resistance.

But then, in the wild-type, with both X and G1/G3 active, the resistance is 100%.

But in g1, which has a non-functional G1, X is still active, so resistance is 100% minus G1's contribution. But the data says g1 is 75%, which suggests that G1 contributes 25% when X is active. Similarly, g3 is 50%, meaning G3 contributes 50% when X is active.

So when G1 is knocked out, the resistance drops to 75% because G3 is still providing 50% (but why isn't it 100% -25% =75%)? Hmm.

Wait, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy implies that each can compensate for the other. So knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. Which is what's happening in g1g3 (10% vs 50% and 75%). So that fits.

But the question is about epistasis. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of the double mutant should match the single mutant of G1. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both, so that doesn't fit. So maybe D is incorrect.

Wait, no. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, it means that G1's function is upstream of G3. So in the absence of G1, the function of G3 doesn't matter. So if G1 is knocked out, the resistance should be same as when both are knocked out.

But in the data, g1 is 75%, and g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit. So D is probably not correct.

Back to the idea that G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. So in the wild-type, both are expressed, giving 100% resistance.

In g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But then why is resistance 75%? If G3's function is 50%, then without G1, the resistance should be 50% (as in g3), but it's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor for a different gene, say Y. And Y is required for both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, Y isn't produced, so G1 and G3 can't function. So in g1, Y is present, so G3 works, giving 50%, but the data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor for G1. So G1 is expressed only if G2 is present. G3 is expressed regardless of G2. So in g2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But that would mean g3 should have 50% resistance as before. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, giving 50%, but the data says 75%. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: perhaps G2 is a TF for a gene that produces a component required for both G1 and G3 to function. So, without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. But with G2, all three genes function.

In the single mutants:

- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed (since G2 is required for G3?), but data says g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's move to the options again and see which one aligns best.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is epistatic to G1, then in a double mutant of G1 and G2 (g1g2), the resistance is same as g2 (0%). Which matches the data.

G1 is the TF. So G1 is upstream of G2 and G3. But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is same as when G2 is knocked out, so that would mean G2's function is essential. But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G2 and G3 are not expressed. But in the data, g1 is 75%, so that would mean G2 and G3 are not expressed, but the resistance is 75%—that doesn't make sense.

So option A is probably wrong.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1 (75%), but data says 10%. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy → g1g3 is worse than either, which fits.

But epistatic: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in g1g3, the resistance should match g1. But data is 10%, which is worse than either. So doesn't fit.

So perhaps none of the options are perfect, but let's think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier about g1g3. Let's think about what the double mutants tell us.

g1g3: 10% resistance.

Which is much lower than either single mutant. So without both G1 and G3, the resistance is much worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 contribute additively to the same pathway. So the total resistance is additive of their individual contributions.

So if G1 provides 25% (from g1: 75%) and G3 provides 50% (from g3: 50%), then together without both, you lose 25 +50 =75%, so resistance is 25%. But the observed is 10%, which is lower. So perhaps there's a synergistic effect, or maybe a more complex interaction.

But in any case, the key point is that the double mutant is worse than either single, which suggests additive or synergistic effects.

Now, looking at the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Which would mean that each can perform the same function. In that case, the loss of both would not have a more severe phenotype than the loss of one. But in the data, the double mutant is worse, so redundancy might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways. So without both, the plant has no resistance.

Wait, but if they are in parallel pathways, each contributes a certain level.

In g1: 75% (so G3 is providing 75% of the resistance?)

In g3: 50% (so G1 is providing 50%? Or G3 is providing 50%.)

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the same resistance mechanism. So the total resistance is the sum of both.

So in the wild-type, with both, 100% resistance.

g1: only G3 is active, giving 50% → but the data says 75%. Doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor for G1, which in turn is a TF for G3. So G2 → G1 → G3.

In that case, without G2 (g2), G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But why would g1 have 75% resistance? Because G3 is providing 75% of the function.

In g3, G2 and G1 are present, so G3 isn't expressed. But the data says g3 is 50%—so that doesn't fit.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to match the options.

The data indicates:

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are additive in their effects.

Which option reflects this?

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy doesn't fit the additive model. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, which is correct.

But in option A, G1 is the TF, which doesn't fit with G2 being epistatic. Because if G1 is TF, G2 would be downstream, so G2 wouldn't be epistatic.

Wait, if G1 is the TF, and G2 is downstream, then a double mutant of G1 and G2 would have the same phenotype as G2. Because without G1, G2 is not expressed. So that's what the data shows in g1g2: 0%, same as g2.

But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G2 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance should be 0%, but the data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

So option A can't be correct.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: the presence of G2's function is required for any resistance. So G2 is the first step. Without G2, nothing works.

In the single mutants:

- g2: 0% (no G2, no resistance)

- g1: G2 is present, so G2 works. So the resistance is due to G2's function. But why is it 75%? Maybe G1 contributes to the pathway that G2 is controlling.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF for a gene that contributes to the resistance. And G1 and G3 are in a parallel pathway.

Wait, perhaps G2's pathway provides 75% resistance, and G1's pathway provides 25%. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G2's pathway is the major one (75%), and G1 and G3 are in a minor, additive pathway.

But I'm not making much progress. Let's think about the options again.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either. But in this case, since G2 is the TF, and if G2 is required for G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But that can't be because in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either.

Wait, no. If G2 is the TF, then in g1g3, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 should be expressed.

But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps G2 is not a TF for them.

Wait, but the question states that at least one is a TF acting upstream of others. So G2 is the likely candidate.

In that case, G2 is the TF for both G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 should be expressed. But in the data, resistance is 10%, which is almost no resistance. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of the options again.

Only option D says G2 is the TF, which fits with G2 being epistatic. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%—so worse than either, which fits with additive or redundant genes.

But the key is epistasis and which gene is epistatic to others.

Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (as in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are same as g2), that suggests G2 is upstream.

So the correct option is D or A?

Wait, let's read the options again.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream of G1. Because epistasis is when a downstream gene masks the effect of an upstream gene.

Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic to G1, that means G2 is downstream. Because the phenotype of the double mutant (g1g2) would match the single mutant with the downstream gene (g2).

So in option A, G1 is upstream (TF), G2 is downstream, and G2 is epistatic to G1. Which fits with the data, because in g1g2, the resistance is same as g2.

But in this scenario, in g1, G2 is present, so the resistance should be same as wild-type. But data says g1 is 75%—so that doesn't fit.

So option A can't be correct.

Therefore, the only option left that has G2 as TF is option D.

Wait, but option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.

Redundancy would mean that knocking both out gives a worse phenotype than either alone, which matches the data (g1g3 is 10%).

So, in option D:

- G2 is the TF, so G1 and G3 are downstream.

- G1 and G3 are redundant.

- G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 should match g1. But data says it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding epistasis here. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the presence of a non-functional G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype should be same as the g1 mutant. But in our data, the double mutant is worse—so that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the epistatic relationship is the other way around. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the double mutant would match g3. But data doesn't say that either.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are additive, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But that doesn't fit the epistasis part.

Option D might not fit. The only option that has G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic is option D or possibly none.

Wait, looking again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in this case, G1 being epistatic would mean that the phenotype of the double mutant is same as G1, but it's worse than both. So this isn't matching.

Wait, maybe I've been getting epistasis backwards. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the function of G3 depends on G1. So without G1, G3 can't function. So in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G1.

But in the data, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either, so that's not matching.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The data suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 contribute additively. 

Looking at the options, the only option that has G2 as TF and G2 being epistatic is option A, but that has G1 as TF, which doesn't fit.

Wait, no. Option D has G2 as TF.

So in option D, G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But the data doesn't fit that.

So perhaps the correct option is option D, despite the epistasis part not matching perfectly. Or perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, another angle. If G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, and G2 is a TF, then in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So in g2, resistance is 0%.

But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So resistance would be same as g3, which is 50%, but data says g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Unless G1 has another function. Maybe G1 is part of a different pathway that also contributes.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2. Maybe G2 is a TF for a different gene, which in turn affects G1 and G3.

But I'm not making progress. I'll have to pick based on the data. The key points are:

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 contribute additively.

The only option that has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic is option D, but I'm not sure about the rest.

Alternatively, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, which fits the data. But in option A, G1 is the TF, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in epistasis direction.

If G2 is epistatic to G1, that means G2 is downstream of G1. So G2's function is required for G1 to function. So in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G2.

Which fits the data.

But if G1 is the TF, then in g1, G2 and G3 are not expressed. But data says g1 is 75%, so that can't be.

So, I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

But the data doesn't fit perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the single mutants, their resistance should be similar. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit redundancy.

Hmm. I think the correct option is D, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for another angle. The fact that the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both. So G2 is the downstream gene. Wait, no, epistatic means it's downstream.

Wait, if G2 is downstream, then G2's function is required for G1 and G3 to function. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. So in the double mutants, resistance is same as G2.

Which fits.

In that case, G2 is epistatic towards G1 and G3, meaning it's downstream. So the correct option would be one where G2 is downstream, and the TF is upstream.

But the question says that one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 might be the TF.

Wait, no. If G2 is downstream, and the TF is upstream, perhaps G2 is the TF.

Wait, no, if G2 is downstream, and the TF is upstream, then the TF would be for G2.

But the data suggests G2 is the TF.

I think I'm going in circles. The only option that fits is option D, but I'm not sure. So I'll go with option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The resistance data for single and double mutants provides insights into their functional relationships:

1. **Single Mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (G1 contributes partially).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (G2 is essential for resistance).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (G3 contributes to resistance).  

2. **Double Mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G3).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive or synergistic effects between G1 and G3).  

### Key Observations:
- **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**: The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both show 0% resistance, matching the phenotype of g2. This indicates that G2 is downstream and essential for the function of G1 and G3.  
- **G1 and G3 contribute additively**: The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). This suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but rather contribute to the same pathway in an additive manner.  

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor (TF), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - This is inconsistent because G2 being epistatic to G1 implies G2 is downstream, but G1 being the TF would require G2 to be expressed in g1, which is not the case (g1 has 75% resistance).  

- **Option B**: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - This is incorrect because G1 and G3 do not share the same promoter (their single mutants have different resistance levels). Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than g1.  

- **Option C**: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - This is incorrect because G1 is not epistatic to G3. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than g1, which contradicts the idea of G1 being epistatic.  

- **Option D**: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - This partially fits. G2 as the TF aligns with its role as a critical upstream regulator. However, G1 and G3 do not show redundancy because their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than g1.  

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. However, none of the options perfectly align with the observed data. If forced to choose, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, even though the redundancy and epistasis claims are not fully supported.
