Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

The question consists of three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products based on the reactants and conditions given. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically an enolate, and the electrophile is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, I need to determine which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate, which acts as a nucleophile. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl; it's the Michael acceptor.

So in the reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me draw this out mentally. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate from malonate would attack the CH2 part (beta carbon) of the acrylate. 

When the enolate attacks, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond, and the oxygen will have a negative charge, which is stabilized by resonance. Then, the product would undergo protonation, probably in the work-up step.

Wait, but what's the structure after the attack? Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH-. The enolate would be the conjugate base, so when it attacks the acrylate, which is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, the attack would be at the beta carbon (the CH2 part). So the CH2 would become a new CH group connected to the malonate part.

Wait, maybe I should think about the regiochemistry here. The Michael addition typically adds the nucleophile to the less substituted position because the enolate is a strong base and tends to attack the less hindered carbon. But in this case, the acrylate has a p-tolyl group on the alpha position, so the structure is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: numbering starts from the carbonyl. So for acrylate, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon? That can't be right. Oh wait, no, I think maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. That makes sense for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and
