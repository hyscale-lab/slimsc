Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let me read the question again. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so the electron is moving to the right (since it's from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). Both are on the same line, so their initial motion is along the horizontal axis towards each other.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, their annihilation should produce gamma rays or high-energy photons. But the question says both photons have the same energy. So each photon has half the energy of the combined system.

Wait, but wait. The total energy and momentum must be conserved here. Because in any collision, momentum and energy are conserved. So initially, we can calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. Then, after the collision, the photons' energies and directions must match those totals.

Right, so let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the rest masses. The electron and positron have the same mass, right? The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, since they're moving, their energies are higher due to their Lorentz factors.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given. For the electron, gamma_e = 4. For the positron, gamma_p = 2.

So the total energy of the electron is gamma_e * m_e c², and similarly for the positron. But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum will be opposite in direction.

Momentum is a vector, so I need to consider the signs.

Electron's velocity is to the right (let's say positive x-direction), and the positron's velocity is to the left (negative x-direction).

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e in the positive x-direction. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p in the negative x-direction.

Wait, but velocity is related to gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

But maybe it's easier to calculate the momentum in terms of gamma. Because momentum p = gamma * m * v, but v can be expressed in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, since p = gamma * m_e * v, and v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Wait, perhaps an easier way is to express the momentum as p = gamma * m_e * c² / (c²) * v? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: p = (gamma m_e v) = (gamma m_e c) * (v/c). But v/c can
