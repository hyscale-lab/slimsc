Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a planet with Earth's radius orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, biggerâ€”2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have and still show both transit and occultation events. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when a planet transits its star, it passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some light. For occultation, it's the opposite: the planet moves behind the star from our view, so the planet's light (if it emits any) is blocked. But wait, planets don't emit much light, so occultation is when the planet is hidden by the star. But I think the key here is about the orbital periods and their alignment.

Wait, wait. Both planets have to transit and occultate. So for a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. So the orbital periods must be such that the two events can happen at the same time from our line of sight.

Wait, no, the question is about the second planet exhibiting both events. Because the first planet is already given, perhaps the second planet's period has to be such that its orbit allows both events when observed from Earth.

Wait, maybe the question is about how the orbital periods of the two planets relate. Because if they're in the same orbital plane and transit, their orbital periods must be such that their orbits are synchronized in a way that the second planet can sometimes be in front (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit? No, wait, that's more about whether a planet can have moons. Maybe it's about orbital stability. But the question is specifically about transit and occultation events, so maybe it's about whether the second planet's orbit is within the star's habitable zone or something else? No, I don't think so.

Wait, another thought. For
