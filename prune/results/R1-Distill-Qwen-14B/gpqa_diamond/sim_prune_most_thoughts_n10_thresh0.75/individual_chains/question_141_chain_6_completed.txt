Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d—does that mean the bromine is in the para position? Or wait, the numbering might be off. Let me get this clear. Benzene has six positions. If it's 1-bromo-2-d, I think the bromine is on position 1, and there's a deuterium (d) on position 2. Or maybe it's a typo and the structure is 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, wait, the way it's written, it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo, 2-deutero benzene. So the molecule has a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially with halobenzenes, NaNH2 might facilitate elimination or some kind of substitution.

Wait, when you have a halobenzene treated with a strong base like NaNH2, especially in a polar aprotic solvent like ammonia, I think it's about elimination. Like, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond—a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, like a benzene ring with a CH2 group turning into CH2Br, but wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the benzene ring. So the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Structure-wise, the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So the ring has Br at C1, D at C2. The other positions are H.

When NaNH2 is used, which is a strong base, it likely abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the Br. Wait, but in benzene, the adjacent positions are meta and para? No, wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for C1 with Br, the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. But in this case, C2 has a D, so it's deuterated. So the H that can be abstracted would be from C6 or perhaps C3 or C4? Wait no, wait. Wait, let me number the benzene properly. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is Br, so positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So the adjacent to position 1 are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, so the H that's adjacent to Br is at position 6. But wait, position 6 is next to position 1 and 5. So in 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the only available adjacent H is at position 6.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So it would abstract a proton alpha to the leaving group. Since the Br is a good leaving group, the base would take a proton beta to the Br, leading to elimination—like an E2 mechanism. So the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond with the Br.

Wait, but in aromatic rings, elimination usually forms an alkyne or something else? No, wait, wait. Wait, in benzene rings, when you have a leaving group like Br, and a strong base abstracts a proton adjacent to it, you get a ring contraction or expansion? Or maybe it forms a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already fully conjugated.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the reaction of bromobenzene with a strong base. Oh wait, I think this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond and HBr elimination. So, benzene with Br in position 1, and the adjacent H removed, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C2 has a D, which is a deuterium. Oh wait, but if the base abstracts a proton, which is on C6, then the adjacent to Br, but C6 is next to C1 and C5. So abstracting a H from C6 would lead to a double bond between C1 and C6, but wait, that's adjacent to Br. So wait, eliminating HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Let me draw this. Benzene ring: position 1 has Br, position 2 has D, and the others (3,4,5,6) have H. If the base takes a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), then elimination of HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and the Br is gone. But wait, where does the double bond form? Let me think. When the H is abstracted from C6, and the Br leaves, the electrons from C1 would form the double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but wait, isn't that just creating a ring with a double bond in a different position? But wait, benzene is all conjugated, so maybe this doesn't change the ring's structure.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with aliphatic elimination. In aliphatic systems, E2 leads to the formation of an alkene. But in aromatic rings, maybe this leads to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction or other aromatic substitution reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of aromatic nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, you usually need activating groups. Bromine is a deactivating group, so nucleophilic substitution on bromobenzene is unlikely without a strong activating group present.

Wait, but wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia. I think that in such conditions, NaNH2 can act as a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzyn intermediate. Benzyn is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring, but I'm not too familiar with the details.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene treated with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think in such conditions, the base abstracts a proton beta to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond (like a vinyl group) as an elimination product.

Wait, but let me think about the possible elimination. The H must be abstracted from a position adjacent to the Br. So the only available H is at position 6 (since position 2 has a D). So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, then the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but wait, how does that affect the ring structure?

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Adding another double bond would require the ring to become non-aromatic, but that's not possible. So maybe elimination isn't the right way to think.

Wait, another possibility: the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Benzyn (or didehydrobenzene) is a highly strained cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in some cases, elimination can lead to the formation of a triple bond, but in benzene, that's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Since the solvent is ammonia, maybe the deuterium is involved. Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the D is on position 2, and the solvent is liquid NH3, perhaps the D can be abstracted. But wait, D is a heavier isotope and less likely to be abstracted as easily as H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation to form a new substituent. Let me think about the possible products. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then elimination of HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the benzene ring can't have a four-membered ring, maybe that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta elimination. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: when a halobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it undergoes elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but I don't think that's possible in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group. But that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. The bromide leaves, and an amide ion acts as a nucleophile, but in that case, you'd get an amination product. But in that case, what would be the structure? The amide ion (NH2^-) would attack the benzene ring where the Br was, leading to a substitution product. But wait, aromatic nucleophilic substitution usually requires activating groups, and Br is a meta director, which is deactivating. So SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) requires electron-withdrawing groups, but Br is an electron-withdrawing group via induction but is ortho/para directing. Wait, but without an activating group, SNAr is not feasible. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but even if SNAr were possible, the product would be an aminobenzene. But the solvent is ammonia, so maybe the product would be benzene with NH2 group where Br was. But I'm not sure if that's possible under these conditions.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If SNAr happens, you would get 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But wait, the solvent is ammonia—NaNH2 in NH3. So perhaps the amide ion (NH2^-) substitutes the Br. But considering the conditions, would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to the formation of a triple bond. For example, benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would be a very strained structure, so that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The question is, how many organic products are formed? So perhaps multiple products are possible if there are multiple positions where the base can abstract a proton.

But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the only available proton adjacent to Br is at position 6. So the base can only abstract that H, leading to one elimination product. Wait, but in the benzene ring, after elimination, how many isomers would form?

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a diene or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring structure, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this: when bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in NH3, it typically undergoes elimination to form benzene with a double bond, but that's not possible as benzene is already a ring of six carbons with three double bonds. So maybe the product is a benzyn intermediate, which is a highly unstable diradical, and then perhaps it can undergo further reactions.

Alternatively, under these conditions, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzyne (a triple bond in the ring). Wait, benzyne is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene, but that would imply a triple bond. I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but if the reaction forms benzyne, then perhaps it's a diradical that can form various products.

Wait, but benzyne is a transient species that can undergo various reactions, such as trapping with dienophiles or other nucleophiles. But in this problem, the solvent is condensed ammonia, so perhaps the benzyne can react with the amide ion (NH2^-) to form different products.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If elimination occurs, you get benzyne. Benzyne is a very reactive intermediate. But in this case, perhaps the benzyne can undergo ring expansion or contraction, but that's probably not feasible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo dimerization, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium and an amino group. But that seems like a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, so it will abstract a proton. The H must be adjacent to the Br to facilitate elimination. So the H is at position 6. When the base abstracts that H, the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But benzene is already a conjugated system, so this would form a cyclohexa-1,2-diene, right? Wait, that's not possible because benzene is fully aromatic, so adding another double bond would disrupt that.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts, but I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe the ring becomes non-aromatic, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a vinyl group. So, if the Br is at position 1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, but C2 has a D. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but the D is still there. Wait, but that would mean the structure is CH2=CH with D on C2. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new substituent. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6. But how does that change the structure? It's the same as the original benzene, just with a different arrangement of double bonds. But that doesn't change the molecule's identity, so it would still be considered the same product.

Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2, perhaps there are different possible regioisomers? Or maybe not. Because the ring is symmetric, the position of the double bond might not lead to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but via substitution. If the Br is replaced by an amide group, then the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But I'm not sure if the conditions favor that.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, in ammonia solvent, the amide ion (NH2^-) is a good nucleophile. So in SNAr, the amide would substitute the bromide. But aromatic nucleophilic substitution requires that the ring is activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene is deactivated, so SNAr is unlikely without a strong activating group. So substitution probably doesn't occur here.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about what the options are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So perhaps the reaction produces multiple products based on where the elimination occurs.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. So the elimination would only occur there, leading to a single product. But wait, wait. Because the ring is symmetric, perhaps the elimination could form the same product regardless of which H is abstracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diradical that can form different products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as a substitution. Let's say the Br is replaced by an amide group. But as I thought earlier, SNAr is unlikely because Br is a deactivating group. Without activating groups, the ring won't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily.

Wait, but if the solvent is ammonia, and the base is strong, maybe the reaction proceeds through a different mechanism. Another possibility is that the deuterium is involved in some way, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think that NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's more likely to abstract protons, leading to elimination. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond. But in benzene, all double bonds are delocalized, so adding another double bond isn't possible. So perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, which is called benzyne. If that's the case, then benzyne can react in different ways. But in the given reaction, the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps benzyne can capture an amide ion (NH2^-) in some fashion.

Wait, when benzyne is formed, it's a very reactive species. It can undergo various reactions, such as trapping with nucleophiles or coupling reactions. But under the conditions of ammonia and NaNH2, perhaps the benzyne can react further.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can dimerize, but that's not the case here as the question is about the product formed from the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to benzyne, which can then react with the amide ion. But in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, so the benzyne would have the D at position 2 and the triple bond between positions 1 and 2? Or between 1 and 6?

Wait, no. Wait, if the H is abstracted from position 6, then the Br leaves, forming a double bond between 1 and 6. But in that case, the ring would have a double bond between 1 and 6, which is adjacent to the D at 2. So how would that affect the structure? Maybe the benzyne forms a triple bond between 1 and 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of possible products. If the reaction leads to the formation of benzyne, which is a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, then the product would have the triple bond in a specific position. But considering the starting material, the only position available for elimination is between 1 and 6, but that's a meta position.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a single product because there's only one possible site for elimination. So the product would be a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products due to different sites of elimination. But in this case, the only possible site is position 6. So the product would be a single compound.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure is such that the Br is at position 1, D at 2. The possible H's adjacent to Br are only at position 6. So the elimination would happen there, leading to a single product.

So the number of possible organic products is 1. So the answer would be B)1.

But wait, another thought: could the base abstract a hydrogen from another position, leading to a different product? Like, maybe an ortho hydrogen or something else. But in this case, the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. So no, there's only one way the elimination can happen.

So the only product formed is the elimination product. So the number of products is 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and in such conditions, it typically abstracts a proton adjacent to the leaving group (Br) to facilitate elimination. 

In this case, the bromine is at position 1, and the only available proton adjacent to the bromine is at position 6 (since position 2 has a deuterium, which is not abstracted under these conditions). The base abstracts the proton at position 6, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single elimination product.

The benzene ring remains aromatic, and the double bond formed does not lead to any structural isomerism because the aromaticity of benzene ensures that the double bonds are delocalized. Since there is only one possible site for elimination (position 6), the reaction produces a single organic product.

Thus, the number of possible organic products formed in this reaction is **1**.

Answer: B
