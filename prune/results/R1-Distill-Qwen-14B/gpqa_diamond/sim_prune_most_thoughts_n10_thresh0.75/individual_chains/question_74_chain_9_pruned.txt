Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me think this through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So the initial setup is that the decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes. That probably relates to the half-life or something. Oh right, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. So the probability of decay isn't linear over time, right?

The formula I remember is the decay law: N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt). But since the question is about probabilities, maybe I should think in terms of the cumulative probability of decay up to time t.

The decay probability P(t) is 1 - e^(-λt). So, when the problem says the probability is 32% within 100 minutes, that's P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural logs: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but maybe I can calculate λ first. Let's compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... let's see, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe around -0.3857? Hmm, more accurately, using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, maybe approximate. Wait, maybe I can recall that ln(2) is about 0.693, and ln(0.5) is -0.693. Alternatively, I can just proceed symbolically.

So λ is ln(1/0.68) / 100. Because e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100.

Wait, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.4706
