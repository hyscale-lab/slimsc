Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with numbers 1, 3, 5, 0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (sometimes called the degree of unsaturation) is a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the index. The formula for calculating it is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But wait, the starting material doesn't have any N or X, so maybe that part won't come into play here.

First, I need to figure out what the reaction does. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of alkyl chlorides, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI is more commonly used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, no, wait. Wait, the Wolff-Kishner uses ammonia and heat with a base to remove carbonyl groups, but that's for ketones or aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to reduce carbonyl groups. Wait, no, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let's try to draw its structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3. So the ring is cyclohexene, meaning one double bond. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the substituents are at positions 2 and
