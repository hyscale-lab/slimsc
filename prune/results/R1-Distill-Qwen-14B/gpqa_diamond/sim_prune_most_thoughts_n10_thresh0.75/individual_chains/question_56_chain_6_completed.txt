Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I remember from my studies that electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. The question is about a specific decay process from the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the possible routes and the corresponding probabilities.

Wait, dipole transitions. Right, in the hydrogen atom, when an electron makes a transition, it's a dipole transition if it emits or absorbs a photon. The selection rules for dipole transitions determine which transitions are allowed. I think the main selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The starting state is |3,0,0⟩. So, n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, n=1, l=0, m=0. So, the electron is going from the third energy level (n=3) to the first (n=1), but wait, that's a big jump. But the problem states it's via two dipole transitions, so it's not a direct transition. It must go through an intermediate state.

So, the first transition is from n=3 to some higher or lower n, but wait, actually, since it's decaying, the energy should decrease. So, from n=3 to maybe n=2, because going from n=3 to n=1 would require a larger energy change, which might not be a dipole transition in a single step. But the question says it's via two steps.

So the first step is from |3,0,0⟩ to some state |n', l', m'⟩, and the second step from there to |1,0,0⟩. Both transitions must obey the selection rules.

Let me think about the selection rules again. For dipole transitions, Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by any integer, but in practice, transitions are between adjacent or nearby levels because of the energy differences.

The starting state has l=0 (s orbital). So, in the first transition, l must change by ±1. So from l=0, the next possible l is 1. Because if l can be -1, but l can't be negative, so only l=1 is allowed.

So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. So the first intermediate state is |n',1,m'⟩.

Wait, but the starting state is |3,0,0⟩. So, the n from 3 could go to 2 or 4? Well, since it's decaying, probably to a lower energy state, so n=2.

So after the first transition, the state would be |2,1,m'⟩. What are the possible m' values? Since m can change by 0, ±1. The starting m is 0, so m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Then, from that intermediate state, the second transition must take it to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if that's possible.

The intermediate state is |2,1,m'⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So, what's the change in l? From 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, which is allowed. What about m? From m' to 0. So the change in m would be Δm = -m', because 0 - m' = -m'. So Δm must be 0, ±1. So, -m' must be 0, ±1.

Wait, let's see. For the second transition, m' can be -1, 0, or +1.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1, -1⟩. Then, Δm would be 0 - (-1) = +1. Which is allowed, since Δm = ±1.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1, 0⟩. Then, Δm is 0 -0 = 0. Allowed.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1, +1⟩. Then, Δm is 0 -1 = -1. Allowed.

So all three cases would allow the transition to the final state.

Wait, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are given, so let me look at them.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: The transition route isn't written clearly, but it looks like it might be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3.

Wait, but the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex),". So the options A, B, C, D each have a specific route and a probability.

I need to determine which transition is possible and what's the probability.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. How does the probability come into play here? The selection rules determine allowed transitions, but what about the probabilities?

Wait, I think the key here is to figure out which transitions are possible and then perhaps calculate the probability based on the possible paths.

But wait, the question is asking about the transition route and the corresponding probability, so perhaps each option is a possible route, and the probability is given. I need to determine which option correctly describes the possible route(s) and the correct probability.

Wait, but if all three intermediate states are possible (m=-1,0, +1), then there are three possible routes. So the probabilities might be the sum of the probabilities of each route.

But the options only consider a single intermediate state each. So perhaps each option is a possible route, but not all of them are allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps not all m values are allowed. Let me think about the dipole transition matrix elements.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_{1m}, where Y are the spherical harmonics.

The matrix element ⟨n', l', m'| r |n, l, m⟩ is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m ±1, 0.

But in our case, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so l=0, m=0.

After first transition, l becomes 1, m can be ±1 or 0.

So, the possible m values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

Then, from each of these, the second transition is to |1,0,0⟩.

So, for each intermediate state, the transition to the final state must have m changing from m' to 0, which is Δm = -m'.

Which, as I determined earlier, is allowed for any m' = -1, 0, +1.

So, all three intermediate states are allowed.

Therefore, the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

So, the probabilities for each path would be (probability of first transition to |2,1,m⟩) multiplied by (probability of second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩).

But I'm not sure about the actual probabilities. Maybe each m has an equal probability? Or do they differ based on selection rules or other factors like the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients?

Alternatively, perhaps the intermediate state must have the same m as the initial state or something. Wait, no, the m can change by 0, ±1.

But in the initial state, m=0. So the first transition can go to m' = -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition has to get m back to 0.

So, for the intermediate state |2,1, m'⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ must have m' → 0, which requires a Δm = -m'.

So, each of the three possible intermediate states is allowed.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the transition probabilities.

However, without knowing the actual probabilities of each transition (which would require knowing the matrix elements), perhaps the question is more about the possible routes rather than the exact probability.

Wait, but the options are each giving a specific route and a probability. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the only allowed transition is when m changes by 0 in each step? Or maybe there's another consideration.

Wait, another factor: parity. The parity of the state is (-1)^l. The initial state has l=0, parity even. The dipole operator has parity -1. So, after a dipole transition, the parity changes. So, let's see:

First transition: from l=0 (even parity) to l=1 (odd parity). Because dipole operator changes parity.

Second transition: l=1 to l=0. Because again, dipole operator changes parity. So the final state has l=0, even parity. So the overall parity change is even (even → odd → even), which is correct.

So parity is maintained, so that's okay.

But how does this affect the possible m transitions? Hmm, perhaps it doesn't.

Wait, maybe the selection rule applies to each transition. So for each step, in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, the allowed m' are m=0±1, so m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the initial m is 0, so for the first transition, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, in the second transition, from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, m'' must be 0.

So, for each m', the change from m' to 0 is allowed as Δm = -m' (so m can go from -1→0, 0→0, +1→0). So all three transitions are allowed.

Thus, there are three possible paths:

1. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

2. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

3. |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

So, each option is one of these paths, but the question is which one is the correct transition route and what is the probability.

Wait, but the options only show one path each. So perhaps the problem is which of these is the correct transition, considering the possible selection rules and the transition probabilities.

But how to determine which of these is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the decay isn't via two dipole transitions but via a different process, but the question says it is via two dipole transitions.

Wait, perhaps the possible transitions require that the sum of the changes in m is zero. For example, in the first transition, m changes by +1, then in the second, it changes by -1. Or something like that.

Wait, but each transition can have any m change as long as it's within 0, ±1. So, for the first transition, m can go from 0 to any m' = -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, m' can change to 0.

So, the total change in m is m' - 0 (from first transition) plus (0 - m') (from second) equals 0. So overall, m doesn't change. Which is correct because the initial and final m are zero.

But that doesn't tell us which path is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the probability is determined by the possible m transitions. Let's think about the selection rules in more depth.

The transition probability depends on the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states.

The dipole operator has components like rY_{1m} (in spherical harmonics), so the matrix element ⟨f| r |i⟩ is non-zero only if the angular momentum selection rules are satisfied, which we've already considered.

The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of this matrix element. The matrix element itself depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which relate the angular momenta of the initial and final states.

For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2, l=1, m'⟩, the matrix element would involve coupling l=0 (initial) and l=1 (dipole) to get l'=1.

Wait, the initial state has l=0, so when you apply the dipole operator (l=1), you can only get l'=1, since 0 +1 =1.

So, for the first transition, the possible m' are -1, 0, +1, as we said.

For the second transition, from l=1 to l=0, you need to apply another dipole operator (l=1). So, 1 +1 can go to l'=0. So, the possible transitions are l=1 → l=0 with Δl = -1.

The matrix element here would again depend on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

But without getting into the detailed Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, perhaps the number of possible m transitions will affect the probability. For each step, the number of possible m transitions would influence the overall probability.

Wait, but each step's transition probability depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩:

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m' | r |3,0,0⟩ would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m' = m ±1.

Wait, but Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1: since l=0 can only combine with l=1 to make l=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are:

For m = 0, the possible m' for the new state are m' = 1, 0, -1.

The coefficients are:

For m' = 1: ⟨1,1|0,0⟩⟨1,1| → coefficient is √( (1-0)(1+0+1) )^(1/2) ... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m' to get l=1, m_total.

In this case, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator has l=1, m= m', so the matrix element would be non-zero only if the sum of the angular momenta gives the final state.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the possible m transitions.

The initial state has m=0. The dipole operator has m components m' = -1, 0, +1. So, for the matrix element ⟨2,1,m'| r |3,0,0⟩, the only non-zero contributions are when m' equals the m of the dipole operator, which is -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps each transition (m=0→m'=-1, 0, +1) has a certain probability.

Similarly, for the second transition, each m' → m''=0 has certain probabilities.

But without knowing the exact coefficients, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible ways.

Wait, another approach: in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, how many possible m' are there? Three: -1, 0, +1.

Each has an equal probability? Or do the probabilities depend on some factors?

In reality, the transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements. For the first transition, the matrix elements for m' = -1, 0, +1 would be different.

Wait, for m=0, the dipole operator can cause transitions to m' = -1, 0, +1.

But the matrix elements would be largest for m'=0 because the operator's m=0 component (the polar component) would couple more strongly when the initial and final m are the same.

Wait, perhaps the transition probabilities for each m' are proportional to certain factors.

Let me think: when you have a transition from m=0 to m'=0, the matrix element would be non-zero and perhaps larger in magnitude than for m' = ±1.

Alternatively, the matrix elements for m' = ±1 would be zero because the initial m is 0, and the dipole operator's m=±1 components would require the initial m=0 to change by ±1, which would be allowed.

Wait, but why would the matrix element for m'=0 be larger? Because when the initial and final m are the same, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient may be larger.

Hmm, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m_initial ±1 or 0. But for the initial m=0, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps the transition probability for each m' is:

For m'=0: probability proportional to (some factor),

m'=1: another factor,

m'=-1: another.

But without exact values, it's tricky. But perhaps, in the first transition, the probability for m'=0 is higher than for m'=±1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for another approach: perhaps the possible transition from n=3 to n=2, l=1 has certain selection rules, and the allowed m' are all possible, but when considering the second transition from n=2 to n=1, only certain m' would allow the transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but earlier we saw that all three are allowed.

So, the probabilities would add up for each path.

But the options only consider one path each.

Wait, perhaps the question is which of these is possible, but the probability is given as an option.

Wait, the options give probabilities 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, or something else. So, perhaps the correct answer is that there are three possible paths, each with an equal chance, so the total probability would be the sum of their probabilities.

But each option gives a single route with a specific probability.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the transition must go through an intermediate state with m=0, leading to a probability of 1/3. Because there are three possible m states, each with a 1/3 probability.

But wait, that's assuming all paths are equally probable, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition with m=0 in the intermediate state occurs with a higher probability.

Wait, another thought: when the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, the m=0. The dipole operator can cause transitions where m changes by 0, +1, -1. So, the probability for each of these transitions would depend on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m= m') to get l=1 and m_total.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,m_total⟩ = |1, m'| comes from combining |0,0⟩ and |1, m_dipole⟩.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for each m' is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 and m'.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1:

For m_total =1: the coefficient is sqrt( ( (1(1+1) - (0(0+1) +1(1+1)) )) / (2(1+1)) )) ) ??? Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps for m_total =1, the coefficient is 1. For m=0, the coefficient is sqrt(2)/2. For m=-1, the coefficient is 0? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2= m' to get l=1, m_total = m'.

So for each m':

Case 1: m_total =1.

m' must be 1 (since 0 + m' =1 → m' =1). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this is 1.

Similarly, for m_total =0.

m' can be 1, 0, -1, but wait, no. Wait, the initial m is 0, so m' (from dipole) must be such that m' = m_total.

Wait, no. The dipole operator has m ranging from -1 to +1.

So, when combining |0,0⟩ and |1, m'⟩, you can get |1, m_total⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,1⟩ is √( ( ( (1)(1+1) - (0)(0+1) ) ) / (2*(1+1)) )) ) Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are:

For |1,1⟩: 1

For |1,0⟩: √(2)

For |1,-1⟩: 1

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 are as follows:

⟨1,m | 0,0 ; 1, m' ⟩.

For m=1:

Only possible if m' =1, since 0 + m' =1 → m'=1.

Coefficient is 1.

For m=0:

Possible when m' = 1 and m' = -1, summed in a certain way.

Wait, no. Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 (which can only contribute m=0) and l=1 (which can contribute m=-1, 0, +1) to get l=1.

The possible combinations:

To get m_total =1:

Only possible by adding m=0 (from l=0) and m'=1 (from l=1).

Coefficient: 1.

To get m_total=0:

Possible by adding m'=1 and m'=-1, but wait, no. Because to get m_total=0, you can have m'= +1 and m'= -1, but how?

Wait, no, the sum is 0 = m0 + m1, where m0 is from the first state and m1 from the second.

But since the first state is m0=0, m1 must be 0. So for m_total=0, you need m1=0.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, 0⟩ is √(2/3) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=0, l2=1, and L=1.

Wait, from what I recall, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=1, l1=0, l2=1 are as follows:

For M=1: the only way is l2=1, m=1. So coefficient is 1.

For M=0: combinations are l2=1, m=1 and m=-1. Wait, no. Wait, when you add l1=0 (m=0) and l2=1 (m=1), you can get M=1.

When you add l1=0 (m=0) and l2=1 (m=-1), you can get M=-1.

But to get M=0, you must have l1=0, m=0 and l2=1, m=0.

Wait, that's not possible because l2=1 has m=-1, 0, +1.

Wait, no, l2=1 can have m=0, so yes. So for M=0, the only way is l2=1, m=0.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,0⟩ is √( ( ( (1)(1+1) - (0)(0+1) ) ) / (2*(1+1)) )) ) Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are:

For M=1: 1

For M=0: √(2)

For M=-1: 1

But that doesn't seem right because the sum of squares would be 1^2 + (√2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 2 + 1 =4, which doesn't normalize to 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct coefficients are:

For M=1: 1

For M=0: 0

For M=-1: 1

But that can't be right because then you can't get M=0.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=0 and l2=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1=0 and l2=1 to get L=1 are:

- For M=1: the only possibility is l2=1, m=1. So coefficient is 1.

- For M=0: must be a combination of l2=1, m=1 and m=-1? Or is there another way?

Wait, no. Because l1=0, m1=0. So for M=0, l2 must have m=0.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for M=0 is √( (2)/3 ), because when you combine l=0 and l=1, the probability for M=0 is proportional to sqrt(2/3).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can find the exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Looking it up, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l1=0 (m1=0) and l2=1 (m2=m') to get L=1 and M=m_total.

The coefficients are:

For M=1: only possible if m2=1. Coefficient is 1.

For M=0: possible if m2=0. Coefficient is √(2/3).

For M=-1: only possible if m2=-1. Coefficient is 1.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the square of each should sum to 1.

Wait, 1^2 (for M=1) + (√(2/3))^2 (for M=0) + 1^2 (for M=-1) = 1 + (2/3) +1 = 2 + 2/3 = 8/3, which is more than 1. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about the correct way to compute the coefficients.

When you add two angular momenta, J1 and J2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are given by:

⟨ J, M | J1, m1; J2, m2 ⟩

For J1=0, m1=0; J2=1, m2 = m'.

We need to find the coefficients for J=1, M = m'.

Possible M values are -1, 0, +1.

For each M, the possible m2 values are:

M=1: m2=1 (since m1=0).

M=0: m2=0.

M=-1: m2=-1.

So the coefficients are:

⟨1, 1 | 0,0;1,1⟩ = 1

⟨1, 0 | 0,0;1,0⟩ = 1

⟨1, -1 | 0,0;1,-1⟩ = 1

Wait, but earlier I thought the coefficients might have different values, but perhaps this is correct.

In that case, all three transitions are equally probable for the first step.

So the probability for each m' in the first transition is 1/3.

Then, in the second transition, from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, each m' would allow a transition, but what's the probability for each?

Again, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would determine this.

For each intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩.

So, the matrix element for the second transition is ⟨1,0,0 | r |2,1,m'⟩.

Similarly to the first transition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would determine the probability.

The coefficient for the second transition is the same as the first, because the process is similar.

So, for each intermediate state, the probability of the second transition is 1/3.

Thus, the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But since there are three possible paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options have probabilities like 1/3, 1/4, etc.

Wait, but perhaps my assumption that each transition has a probability of 1/3 is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the first and second steps are the same as for the first step.

Wait, perhaps each step has a probability of 1, which isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't leading me anywhere. Let me think differently.

The problem is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions.

Each dipole transition can change m by 0, ±1. So, the first transition can go to m' = -1, 0, or +1 with equal probability, and the second transition must bring m back to 0.

If each transition's m change is independent, then the probabilities for each path would be:

For each transition, the change in m is a choice among three options. So, for the first transition, the probability for each m' is 1/3. Then, for the second transition, the probability to go from m' to 0 is 1/3 again, because there are three possible m''.

Wait, but in the second transition, m' must go to 0. So, for each m', the number of possible ways to reach 0 is 1.

But the second transition's m change depends on the intermediate m'.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the probabilities as the product of the individual transition probabilities.

So, for each possible intermediate m', the probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three intermediates, the total probability is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But the given options don't have 1/3 as a sum, but each option gives a single path with a probability. So maybe the question is not about the sum but about each possible route.

Wait, but the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So, each option is a possible route, but only one is correct.

But how to determine which transition is allowed.

Wait, perhaps only transitions where m changes by zero in each step are allowed, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules require that in each transition, the m can change by 0, ±1. So all three paths are allowed.

But the question is about which of the given options is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with 2/3.

Wait, but if each path has equal probability, then each would have a probability of 1/3.

But in that case, the sum would be 1, but each option only considers a single path.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the overall probability but about the probability of each specific path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is the one where the intermediate state has m=0, leading to a higher probability, so the total probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option A has m=0 in the intermediate state.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A, with probability 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of possible ways, leading the probability to be 1/3.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of possible dipole transitions from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two steps.

The number of possible paths would be the number of possible intermediates (three) multiplied by the number of possible second steps (one for each intermediate). So, three paths.

If the question is about the probability for each path, perhaps each path has a probability of 1/9, but the options don't list that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct probability is 1/3, which is the sum of all possible paths.

But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So perhaps the correct answer is that the total probability is 1/3, but looking at the options, only option A has a probability of 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps only one transition path is allowed, but that doesn't seem right since all three are possible.

Wait, another possibility: the change in m for each transition must be the same. For example, in the first transition, m changes by +1, then in the second, it changes by -1, leading to a net change of 0.

But that's just one possible path. But the question doesn't specify any such constraint.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the matrix elements for each possible transition.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which in turn depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient C(0,0;1,m' |1,m').

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=m' to get l=1, m_total = m'.

The coefficients are:

- For m' =1: C =1.

- For m' =0: C = √(2/3).

- For m' =-1: C =1.

So, the probabilities for each m' are:

P(m'=1) = (1)^2 = 1 → 1/ (1+2/3 +1) → Wait, no. Wait, the sum of squares is 1^2 + (√(2/3))^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 2/3 + 1 = 8/3. So each probability is (coefficient squared)/(8/3).

So,

P(m'=1) = (1)^2 / (8/3) ) = 3/8.

P(m'=0) = (2/3) / (8/3) ) = (2/3) * (3/8) ) = 2/8 = 1/4.

P(m'=-1) = (1)^2/(8/3) ) = 3/8.

Wait, so the probabilities for the first transition are:

m'=1: 3/8.

m'=0: 1/4.

m'=-1: 3/8.

Then, for each intermediate state, the second transition's probability.

For the second transition, from |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is again ⟨1,0,0 | r |2,1,m'⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this are the same as before, because the process is similar. So, the probability for each m' is the same as before.

Wait, no, the second transition's probability depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the reverse process. Or maybe it's the same.

So, for the second transition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would be the same as the first transition.

Thus, the probability for each second transition would be:

If the intermediate state is |2,1, m'⟩, then the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has a probability proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m' → 0.

But wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,0⟩ is √(2/3), as before.

Wait, perhaps the second transition's probability is the same as the first transition's, but it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability is 1, because once you're in the intermediate state, the transition to the final state is certain.

But that can't be right because the selection rules must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the second transition's probability is 1 for each m', so the overall probability for each path is (probability of first transition) * 1.

So, the total probabilities for each path are:

- Path 1: m'=1 → P=3/8.

- Path 2: m'=0 → P=1/4.

- Path 3: m'=-1 → P=3/8.

Thus, the total probability would be sum of these, which is 3/8 + 1/4 +3/8 = (3/8 + 2/8 +3/8 )= 8/8=1.

But the question gives options with specific probabilities for each path.

For example, option A's path has m'=0, which has a probability of 1/4.

So, the answer would be option A, with probability 1/4.

Wait, but in this case, the total probability for the path via m'=0 is 1/4.

But the question is about the transition route and the probability. So, if the correct route involves the m'=0 intermediate state, then option A is correct, with a probability of 1/4.

But wait, according to the first transition probabilities, the m'=0 path has a probability of 1/4. The second transition from m'=0 to 0 would have a probability of 1, so the total for that path is 1/4.

But in reality, the second transition's probability isn't necessarily 1.

Wait, perhaps for the second transition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the same as the first, meaning for each m', the transition probability is the same as the first.

So, for the second transition, the probability would be:

If the intermediate is |2,1, m'⟩, then the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has a probability of (C)^2, where C is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m' → 0.

Which, as before, is:

For m' =1: C=1, so P= (1)^2 / (sum over m'') ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with the matrix elements.

The transition probability for each path is:

P = (C1)^2 * (C2)^2,

where C1 is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the first transition and C2 for the second.

For the first transition, when m'=0, C1 = √(2/3).

For the second transition, from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the C2 is again √(2/3).

So, the probability for this path is (√(2/3))^2 * (√(2/3))^2 = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is (C)^2, so for each path, it's (C1^2) * (C2^2).

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the possible states after the first transition are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

The question is which transition is possible, and what the probability is.

The correct answer is that the transition must go through an intermediate state where the angular momentum selection rules are followed in both steps.

But all three are allowed.

Looking at the options, only options A, B, C, and D are given. The probabilities are 1/3, 1/4, etc.

But according to the first transition probabilities:

Only the m'=0 has a probability of 1/4. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, with probability 1/4.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the first transition to m'=0 has a probability of 1/4.

So, if the entire process goes through m'=0, the total probability would be 1/4.

But the problem asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. So, option A's route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

But according to my calculation, the first transition's probability to m'=0 is 1/4, and the second transition would have a probability of 1/4 as well, leading to 1/16 for the path. But this doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the only allowed transition is when m doesn't change (m=0 in both transitions), leading to a higher probability.

But I'm getting stuck and not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another way: The energy levels of the hydrogen atom are E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2.

So, from n=3 to n=1 is a big jump, requiring two steps: 3→2, and 2→1.

The selection rule for n is Δn = ±1 (but it can change by more in some cases, but in dipole transitions, it's restricted).

So, the decay must go through n=2.

Thus, the intermediate state must be n=2, l=1, m=0 (since the initial and final are l=0). So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

So, the possible intermediates are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Now, for each of these, the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ must be possible.

Which of these intermediates can transition to |1,0,0⟩?

The change in l is from 1 to 0, which is allowed (Δl= -1).

The change in m is from m' to 0, which is allowed as Δm= -m'.

So, all three intermediates are allowed.

Now, the question is about the transition route and the probability.

The options are A, B, C, D.

If all three are possible, but the question provides only one correct option, perhaps the correct answer is the one that includes the most probable route.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each intermediate is the same, so each option's probability is 1/3, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, because it involves m=0, which is the most probable.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, I can't be certain.

Wait, perhaps the probability is determined by the sum over all allowed paths.

If all three paths are allowed, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each path.

But the options don't give the sum; each option gives a single path with a probability.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is option A with probability 1/3.


The problem involves the decay of the hydrogen atom state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions dictate that \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). The decay must proceed through an intermediate state \(|n', l', m'\rangle\) that satisfies these rules.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: \(|3,0,0\rangle\) has \(n=3\), \(l=0\), and \(m=0\).
2. **Final State**: \(|1,0,0\rangle\) has \(n=1\), \(l=0\), and \(m=0\).
3. **Intermediate State**: The first transition must satisfy \(\Delta l = \pm 1\). Since \(l=0\) in the initial state, the intermediate state must have \(l=1\). Additionally, \(n\) decreases to 2 (as the decay is from \(n=3\) to \(n=1\) via two steps). Thus, the intermediate state is \(|2,1,m'\rangle\), where \(m'\) can be \(-1\), \(0\), or \(+1\) based on the \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\) rule.

4. **Second Transition**: From \(|2,1,m'\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\), the rules \(\Delta l = -1\) and \(\Delta m = -m'\) are satisfied for all three possible \(m'\) values (\(-1\), \(0\), \(+1\)).

5. **Transition Probabilities**:
   - The probability of each transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the overlap between the initial and final states.
   - For the first transition, the probabilities for \(m' = -1\), \(0\), and \(+1\) are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These probabilities are not equal and depend on the specific matrix elements.
   - For simplicity, the problem assumes equal probabilities for each intermediate state, leading to a total probability of \(1/3\) for the entire decay process.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/3\). This is consistent with the assumption of equal probabilities for each intermediate state.
   - **Option B**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). This suggests unequal probabilities but does not align with the assumption of equal probabilities.
   - **Option C**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,-1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). Similar to Option B, this assumes unequal probabilities.
   - **Option D**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(2/3\). This overestimates the probability for the \(m'=0\) path.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable assumption is that all three intermediate states are equally probable, leading to a total probability of \(1/3\) for the decay process. Among the options, Option A correctly describes the transition route and probability.
