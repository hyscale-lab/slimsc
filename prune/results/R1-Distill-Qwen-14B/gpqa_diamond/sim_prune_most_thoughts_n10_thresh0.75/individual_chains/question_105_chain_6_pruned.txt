Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's area that the spots cover. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing brightness variations that mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, if instead there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the planet's radius relative to the star?

So, I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth is the same as the brightness variation caused by the star's spots.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star's disk. But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't due to a single transit but due to spots covering part of the star's surface.

Wait, but wait. I think when spots are present, the brightness variation depends on how much of the star's surface is covered and the temperature difference. So when a spot comes into view as the star rotates, the observed brightness decreases because the spot is cooler and emits less light.

Let me think about the flux. The star's total flux without any spots is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR^2 σ T^4. But when part of the star is covered in spots, the observed flux changes.

The filling factor (f) is 20% for each hemisphere. Wait, the hemisphere is one side, so the total spot area is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But each hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total spot area would be 0.2 * (2πR²) ? Wait, no. Let's clarify. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So, for one hemisphere, the area
