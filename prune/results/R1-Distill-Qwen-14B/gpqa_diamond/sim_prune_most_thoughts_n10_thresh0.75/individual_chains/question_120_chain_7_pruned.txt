Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. Right, because d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, imagine we're looking at a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means that the number density in space is uniform. So, the number of stars depends on the volume. Because if they're spread out uniformly, the number you see in a certain volume is proportional to that volume.

Wait, but how does the volume change with distance? Let's think about a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², which in this case is 4πd². So the volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, in terms of parallax, since d = 1/plx, plx is inversely proportional to d. Let me substitute d with 1/plx. So d = 1/plx → dd = -d² dplx → because d is 1/plx, so dd = (1/plx²) (dplx), but I'll just note the negative sign as direction, but since we're talking about ranges, maybe the negative isn't an issue here.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)² * (dplx). So volume is proportional to (1/plx²) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the number density. If the number density n is constant (stars per unit volume), then the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) would be n multiplied by the volume element.

So, the number of stars N is n * (4π (1/plx^2) dplx). But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, it's N per dplx, which is proportional to 1/(plx²) times dplx. But wait, when considering how the number changes with plx, I think we're looking at the differential number per unit plx. So, the number per unit plx range (dplx) would be proportional to 1/(plx^2).

Wait, but let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell (at distance d) is proportional to the area of the shell times the thickness in terms of distance. But when expressing it in terms of parallax, which is 1/d, the thickness in plx space is dplx. So, how does the volume element in plx relate?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of differentials. The number of stars dN in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx would be the number density n times the volume between those two plx values.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx would be the integral over all distances from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx), but maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, for small dplx, I can approximate the volume as the surface area at distance d times the thickness in distance, which is dd.

So again, dV = 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitude, the negative can be ignored. So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, no, wait. Let me do it more carefully.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting into dV: 4π (d)^2 dd → 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). So, dV = -4π / plx^4 dplx. The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, so the volume is going down. But when considering absolute numbers, the volume's magnitude is 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in this volume is n * dV. So, dN = n * (4π / plx^4) dplx. So, the number per unit plx range (dplx) is dN/dplx = n * (4π / plx^4).

Wait, that would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you think about the number of stars per unit volume, if the number density is constant, then the number in a volume is proportional to volume. But in this case, the volume element in plx space is 1/plx^4. So, the number of stars per plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would suggest option A is correct.

But I thought earlier that the number per plx would be 1/plx^2, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me see another approach. The number of stars in a certain volume is n * Volume. The volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd is (4/3)π
