Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring... so the ring has two substituents. The ring itself is six-membered, so that's like benzene or something similar. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Hmm, let's count. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. Then the substituents add 2 more. So each substituent must be a single carbon group, or maybe one substituent is two carbons? Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

Wait, the substituents could be groups like -OCH3, but let's think about the IR. The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), so one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, like -X where X is Cl, Br, etc. So one substituent is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl group. 

So the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Wait, wait, but wait. If the substituent is a carbonyl, where would that be? For example, maybe a ketone group attached to the ring. So like a benzene ring with a ketone (C=O) and a halogen, say, in the ortho, meta, or para positions.

Wait, but the substituents could be such that one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, or maybe an ester), and another is a halogen. Alternatively, could the carbonyl be part of another group attached to the ring, like an alkoxy group with a ketone? Hmm.

Wait, but the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon. Like, one substituent is -CO-R, but wait, that might add more carbons. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, substituents like
