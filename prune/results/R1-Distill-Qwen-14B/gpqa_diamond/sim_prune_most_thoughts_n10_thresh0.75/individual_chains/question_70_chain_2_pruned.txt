Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves several reactions and the final part is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me parse the reactions given.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - So, the stoichiometry here is 1 mole of A reacting with 8 moles of B. That ratio suggests maybe a transition metal complex? Because metals often form complexes with ligands in specific ratios. Like, copper can form Cu with ammonia, but I'm not sure. Wait, bright red productâ€”maybe something like Cu, but let me think.

2. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - So C plus 2 D gives E. E is dangerous, so maybe a toxic gas? Or perhaps a strong acid? Or a highly reactive compound. Let me think about what C could be. 

3. Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G, where F is a strong acid and G a weak acid.
   - So, when C is treated with water, it hydrolyzes back into A plus two acids. One strong (like HCl maybe) and one weak (like acetic acid or something). This suggests that C might be a salt that's hydrolyzed in water. Wait, or perhaps an acid chloride? No, because that might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. Because when you hydrolyze metal chlorides, you can get different acids based on the hydrolysis.

Wait, but C reacts with D. Let me think about possible candidates. If C is something like Cu(NO3)2, for example. Let me think. Let's say A is copper metal. Then B could be nitric acid (HNO3), which is a gas in some concentrations. So reaction 1: Cu (solid) reacts with 8 HNO3 (gas) to form Cu(NO3)2 (maybe with some water?), forming a bright red product. Wait, copper nitrate is usually blue, but maybe when it's in a different form, it's red. Alternatively, maybe the product is CuO or something else. Alternatively, could it be a different metal?

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is sulfur. But sulfur is a solid. B could be something like oxygen or another gas. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. When C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids, F and G. So, C must be a compound that when water is added, breaks down into A and two acids.

Let me think about what kind of compounds decompose in water to form acids. Maybe a metal carbonate? No, because then you'd get CO2 and a metal hydroxide. Alternatively, maybe a metal sulfide reacting with water to produce H2S and a metal hydroxide. But then, the acids would be H2S (which is a weak acid) and perhaps another.

Wait,
