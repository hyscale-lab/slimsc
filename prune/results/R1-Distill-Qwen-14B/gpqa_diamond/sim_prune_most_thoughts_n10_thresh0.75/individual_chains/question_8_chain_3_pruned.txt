Okay, so I have this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The goal is to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the given data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup. They're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also some double mutants. The idea is to see how these genes interact in providing resistance.

The key point mentioned is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of another gene. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. That suggests that if one is a transcription factor, knocking it out might affect the expression of other downstream genes.

Now, looking at the results. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type), which is 100% resistant. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility. Let's list the data:

- g1 (single mutant): 75% resistance
- g2: 0% (so super susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3 (double mutant): 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So each single mutant's resistance is as follows. G2 knockout is completely susceptible (0%), which is the most severe. G3 is less severe but still worse than wild-type, and G1 is only partially affected.

Now, looking at the double mutants. When G2 is knocked out in combination with any other gene (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as G2 single mutant. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2, it implies that G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 is same as G2 single mutant.

What does that mean? It suggests that G2 is acting upstream of G1 and G3. Because if G2 is non-functional, then whatever G1 or G3 do downstream doesn't matterâ€”there's no pathway to resistance. So G2 is a transcription factor regulating perhaps G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about the other double mutants, like g1g3? That has 10% resistance. So neither G1 nor G3 alone is sufficient for any meaningful resistance. But why isn't the double mutant showing more susceptibility than either single?

Wait, the g1 single mutant is 75%, which is better than g3's 50% and g1g3's 10%. So combining G1 and G3 knockout makes it worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might function in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. Alternatively, maybe they have some redundant function.

But in the double mutants involving G2, like g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as G2 alone. So G2's function is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but from the data, G2 is epistatic towards both G1 and G3. So if G2 is epistatic, it would mean G2 is upstream. But this option suggests that G1 is a TF, which may not fit with our data. Because G2 knockout is the most severe.

Option B: G2 is a TF. So that aligns with our earlier thought. G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same upstream regions?), which would mean they're co-regulated. G3 is epistatic towards G1? Not sure about that. But looking at the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is more severe than G1's 75%. But when G2 is knocked out in combination, it's 0%. Not sure yet.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits). But how does that fit? Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is epistatic, its effect masks G3's. From the data, in g1g3, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps they're in
