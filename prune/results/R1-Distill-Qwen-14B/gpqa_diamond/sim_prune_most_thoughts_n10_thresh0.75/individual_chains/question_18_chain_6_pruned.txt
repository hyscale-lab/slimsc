Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me read the problem again carefully. So, both stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. But the mass might not factor directly into the calculation here, since the question is about elemental abundances. The given data includes [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, along with [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each.

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Oh right, [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance ratio compared to the Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Sun's value is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that means log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5. So nMg/nH_sun=10^(-5).

Wait, but that might not be directly needed. Let me see.

The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, I think I need to find (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

But how?

Given data:
For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe] is the log of (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 minus the same for the Sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0. So [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) )= 0. So that implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) in the star minus (Fe/H)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, it means that (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun. So the Fe abundance
