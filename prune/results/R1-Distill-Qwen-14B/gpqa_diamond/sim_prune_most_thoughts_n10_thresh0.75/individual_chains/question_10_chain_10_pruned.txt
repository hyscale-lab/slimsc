Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given.

The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D. Let me read the options again.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, right? Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that. So this planet would have that density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5. Hmm, wait, Earth's density is 5.5, and this one has the same density but more mass. Wait, how does mass relate to density? Oh right, density is mass divided by volume. So if the planet has more mass but the same density, its volume must be larger. So the radius would be bigger than Earth.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density as Earth, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would also have 5.5. But wait, mass is 5x, so volume would be (mass)^something? Maybe cube, because volume scales with radius cubed. So radius would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. Because volume is proportional to radius cubed. So if mass is 5 times and density same, mass is density * volume. So volume is mass / density. So mass is 5, density same, so volume is 5 times. So radius would be cube root of 5^(1/3) times Earth's radius. So radius increases, but density doesn't change.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth, 5.5. So this planet's density is the same as Earth.

Wait, so the question is which has the highest density. Let's look at each option's density.

Option a: 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: 5.5 g/cm³.

Option c: 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, so all options except maybe a and others have 5.5? No, wait. Let me recheck each.

Wait, option b says the planet has
