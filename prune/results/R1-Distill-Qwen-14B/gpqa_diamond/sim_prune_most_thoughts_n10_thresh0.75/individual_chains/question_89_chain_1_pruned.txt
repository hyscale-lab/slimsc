Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (di-halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. So, the product here, product 1, is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar.

The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a double bond maybe? Wait, no, the IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, KOH is a base but also a strong nucleophile. Maybe it's a substitution reaction instead of elimination. Because if it's elimination, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Oh wait, maybe it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene, but then what's the IR about?

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone? Oh, wait, if we have a dihalide and we use a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's an example of the formation of a ketone via elimination of two equivalents of HBr. Wait, I think when you have a dihalide and you do a double elimination, you get a diene. But the IR here shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would make a diol, 1,3-diol. But that's substitution, and the IR would show O-H stretches, but the IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where two HBr molecules are lost, forming a double bond. So the product would be an adamantadiene. That would make sense with the IR; wait, no, the IR in that case wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet, right? 4.79 is around where vinyl protons might appear. But wait, if it's an alkene, the protons would be on the double bond. But in adamantadiene, the structure is rigid, so maybe the protons are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? For a vicinal diol, the protons are often around 3.5-4 ppm, but 4.79 is a bit higher.

Wait, another thought. What if it's a ketone? Wait, how would that form? If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes some kind of oxidation or elimination, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by OH, but then what about the other Br? Oh wait, maybe it's a double elimination, forming an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product's structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on opposite bridged positions. When KOH is used, elimination would lead to a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a conjugated diene. So the IR peak at 1720 cm-1â€”wait, that's a carbonyl group. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial product isn't
