Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that the model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. That usually means the lowest energy state possible. But what's the next state? I think in the rotation-vibration model, each vibrational state has rotational levels. Oh right, the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, n=0, and the first excited vibrational state is n=1. But wait, the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's a transition from the ground rotational-vibrational state to the next one, which could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state would then be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrationally excited state (n=1) or a rotationally excited state (like J=1). But which one has lower energy? I think for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the
