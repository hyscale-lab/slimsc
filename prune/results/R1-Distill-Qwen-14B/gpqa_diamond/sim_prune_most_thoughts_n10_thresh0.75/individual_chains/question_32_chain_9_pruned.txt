Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so I think that's Li-6 or Li-7? Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

Hmm, I remember that in physics problems involving relativistic speeds, you need to use the relativistic energy equations. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are definitely important here.

So the first thing I should figure out is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think each nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. For a lithium nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass should be the sum of the individual masses, but wait, wait, no. Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. But wait, in particle physics, when dealing with ions in colliders, the mass used is the rest mass of the nucleus as a whole. So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). So I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/cÂ². So I need to find the mass of Li-6 in kg or in terms of u, then convert to energy units.

Wait, but I might not remember the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I can find the molar mass of Li-6. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. Its molar mass is about 6 g/mol, but wait, that's for 6 u, right? Because 1 mole is 6.022e23 atoms, each weighing 6 u. So 6 u would be 6 * 1.66e-27 kg per nucleus. Let me think: 1 u is 1.6605390
