Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.

Hmm. So, first, I should probably think about the conservation laws here. Since the electron and positron annihilate, their total energy and momentum should be conserved, right? I mean, in any closed system, both energy and momentum are conserved.

Wait, but particles annihilating into photonsâ€”so the photon's energy and momentum must add up to the initial energy and momentum of the electron and positron together.

Since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = |p|c. Also, photons carry momentum in the direction they're moving, so their momentum vectors will be along their direction of travel.

So, the initial system has an electron moving left to right (from the left) and a positron moving right to left (from the right). Wait, wait. Wait, the question says the positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So the positron is moving to the left, since it's moving along the same axis but from the right.

Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so along positive x-direction? Or negative? Wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the axis is, say, x-axis, then the electron is moving to the right (positive x) and the positron is moving to the left (negative x).

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the electron moving along the positive x-direction and the positron moving along the negative x-direction. Because the positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

But wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is coming from the left (so moving to the
