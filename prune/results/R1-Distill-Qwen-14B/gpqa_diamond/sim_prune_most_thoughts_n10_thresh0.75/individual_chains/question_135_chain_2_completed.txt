Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

So the problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interactions in the theory. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. I recall that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because, you know, energy and conservation of momentum require that the rest mass of the boson is enough to create the pair.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian given... Oh, right, this looks like a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction. The term ψ̄ (v + X) ψ would cause the fermion and antifermion to interact with the field X. So the vertex is X ψ ψ, meaning the X boson can decay into two fermions.

But for each possible fermion f, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if the mass of X is at least twice the mass of f. Because each fermion has mass m, so 2m must be ≤ MX. So for each fermion, we check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Because MX is 6 GeV.

What's the mass of each possible fermion? Let's list them.

Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e is negligible, so 0.001 GeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.

Same for muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 GeV <6 → allowed.

Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78= ~3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.

Quarks: 

u quark: mass is about 2-5 MeV, so ~0.002-0.005 GeV. 2m_u ~ ~0.01 GeV, allowed.

d quark: similar, around 3-7 MeV, so 2m_d ~ ~0.014 GeV, allowed.

s quark: around 95-100 MeV, so 2m_s ~ ~0.19 GeV. That's still less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

c quark: mass about 1.27 GeV. 2m_c = ~2.54 GeV <6 → allowed.

b quark: mass around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Wait, 2m_b would be about 8.2-9.4 GeV. Oh, but X is 6 GeV. So 6 is less than 8.2, so 2m_b is bigger than MX. So X can't decay into b bbar because it's not enough energy.

t quark: way too heavy, mass about 173 GeV. So 2m_t is way above 6 GeV. So definitely, no t-quark decays allowed.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons? Like tau, mu, e. Oh, and the quark pairs. So the allowed decays are into any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, wait. Let's double-check each quark.

u: 0.002 GeV → 2m=0.004 → allowed.

d: same as u, allowed.

s: ~0.1 GeV → 2m=0.2 → allowed.

c: ~1.3 GeV → 2m=2.6 → allowed.

b: 4.5 GeV → 2m=9 → X's mass is 6, so no.

So possible decays are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but the options don't have all of these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. Wait, but b is not allowed because 2mb >6 GeV. So option A is not possible since it includes b.

Option B: X → c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes c, which is allowed, but why does it include tau? Oh wait, tau is allowed because 2mt = 3.56 <6. So option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed except for b and t. So option B seems to include all allowed except b and t. But wait, option B says "c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, ddbar, tau pair, mu pair, e pair."

Yes, that's all allowed except for b and t. So that's correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, t is way too heavy. So option C is wrong because it includes t, which can't be.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is not allowed, so option D is wrong because of b.

Wait, the question is about the possible decays. So which options match?

Option B lists all except for b and t. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the problem statement, the interaction is given as -λ_f f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X couples to all the fermions f, right? Because for each f, there's a term. So yes, all the fermions can couple, but only if MX > 2m_f.

So in the Lagrangian, X can interact with any fermion, but kinematics limits to those with 2m_f < MX=6 GeV.

So the fermions allowed are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options, option B lists all of these except for including c, which is correct.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e−. Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

Option D includes b, which isn't allowed. So option B is the correct one.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

This interaction indicates that the boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) via the Yukawa coupling. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson (\( M_X \)) must satisfy the condition:

\[
M_X \geq 2m_f,
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). The mass of \( X \) is given as 6 GeV, so we check the masses of all possible fermions to determine which decays are allowed.

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:

2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
4. **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9.0 > 6 \)).
9. **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

Thus, the allowed decays are \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).
