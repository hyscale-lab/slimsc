Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I'll tackle each one individually and then match the products to the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it's deprotonating something to generate an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it has the enolate at the alpha position. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the methyl acrylate, where does the attack happen? The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate, so maybe O=C-CH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I should think it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(-O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl. Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me think again: the parent chain is acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOO-. So substituents are on the third position. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe it's (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl substituent on the central carbon? Hmm, perhaps the
