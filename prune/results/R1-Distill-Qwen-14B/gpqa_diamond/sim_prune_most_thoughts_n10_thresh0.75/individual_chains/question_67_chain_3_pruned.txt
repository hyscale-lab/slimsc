Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and we're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that these numbers represent their angular momentum quantum numbers. So, l1 and l2 are 1 each, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. Hmm, wait, L1z and L2z are the individual z-components of the orbital angular momenta of the two electrons. Since each electron's orbital angular momentum is described by l=1, their possible m values (for each Lz) are -1, 0, +1.

Wait, so each L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Same for L2z. So when we look at both together, their possible outcomes are combinations like (L1z, L2z) = (-ħ, -ħ), (-ħ, 0), (-ħ, +ħ), (0, -ħ), etc. But the question is about the joint probability that both are -ħ, so the outcome (-ħ, -ħ).

But how does the given state |1,1,2,-1> relate to this? I think we need to expand this state into the product basis of individual states. Because the given state is a coupled state, not the product state.

Wait, the coupled angular momentum states are written as |l1, l2, l, m>. So when the problem says the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>, this is the total state of the two-electron system in terms of their combined angular momentum. But when we're measuring individual L1z and L2z, we're looking at the product basis |m1, m2>, where m1 is m for particle 1, and m2 is m for particle 2.

So to find the probability, I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. Then, the probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would be the square of the amplitude of that product state in the expansion.

Wait, but how do we expand the coupled state into the product basis? I remember that for two angular momenta, the total state can be a combination of product states. The general formula involves Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, but I'm a bit rusty on that.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it this way: the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> can be expressed as a sum over m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = m. In this case, m is -1, so m1 + m2 = -1.

But in this case, our state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1, and the individual
