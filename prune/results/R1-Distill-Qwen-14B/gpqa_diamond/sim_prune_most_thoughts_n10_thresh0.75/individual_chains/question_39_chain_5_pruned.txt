Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, and they mention that when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, so the wave function is a complex one since it includes an 'i'. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ|² dx over that region. And since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region should be zero. 

But wait, the wave function given is for a part of space where the particle can exist. So the probability must be normalized such that the integral from 1 to 3 equals 1. Because the total probability must be 1 for the particle to be somewhere in the allowed region. 

So the approach is to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1. Then solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function again. ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function. But when we take its
