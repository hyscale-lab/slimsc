Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? The options are Red, Violet, Blue, or Yellow.

Hmm, I remember that conjugated pi-electrons have to do with how electrons move in a molecule. Extensive conjugation usually means the molecule can absorb certain wavelengths of light, right? This relates to the concept of electronic transitions in molecules. Oh wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it's because the energy of the photon matches the energy gap between molecular orbitals. So the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the transition between these orbitals.

Wait, but the question is about the color emitted. Oh no, no, wait. No, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. Emission is when a molecule gives off energy after being excited. So the energy it emits is lower than the energy it absorbed. Because when the electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the two states.

But the question is asking about the color absorbed. So the absorbed light would have higher energy than the emitted light. Because the molecule first absorbs a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy one.

Wait, actually, the energy of the emitted light is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the dye emits light, it's because it's dropping from an excited state to a lower energy state. Therefore, the energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is the energy gap that the molecule has between these two states.

But the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, wait, wait. I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. The molecule absorbs a photon, which gives it energy to jump to a higher energy state (excited state), and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one.

Because the absorbed photon's energy is E_absorbed = E_excited - E_ground.

Wait, no
