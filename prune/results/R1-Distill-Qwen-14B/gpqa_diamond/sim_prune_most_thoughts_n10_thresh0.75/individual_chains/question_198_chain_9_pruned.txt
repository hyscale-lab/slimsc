Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about cobalt ions in solution with thiocyanate, and we're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate ions. The problem gives me the stability constants, which are the β values for each complex. The stability constant (β) tells me how stable a complex is—the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's four different β values, so four different complexes must form. Let me think about how these complexes are structured.

I think the complexes are in the order of increasing number of SCN- ligands. So the first complex is Co(SCN)n where n starts from 0. Wait, no. Typically, the complexes increase in the number of ligands. So maybe β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^3+? Or maybe they are numbered differently. Alternatively, perhaps β1 is for the first complex, which is CoSCN^2+ or something else. I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the blue complex is the second one, which would be the β2 complex. But wait, sometimes the numbering can be tricky. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, third [Co(SCN)₃]^3+, and the fourth [Co(SCN)₄]^4+. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the problem is asking about the percentage of the second complex (dithiocyanato) among all cobalt species
