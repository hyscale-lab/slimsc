Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are often represented using Pauli matrices. Wait, the matrix S given here is 2x2, so it's probably a spin-1/2 system. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), right?

So the matrix S is provided: first row is [0, -i], second row is [i, 0]. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Because the Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me recall, sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Oh wait, no, actually sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S is exactly sigma_y. So S is sigma_y.

Now, the operator Ay is c multiplied by sigma_y. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],[i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. So the eigenvalue equation is:

| (-a)      (-i h/(4π)) |
| (i h/(4π)) (-a) | = 0

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Calculating that: (-i)(i) is -i² = -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, because the determinant is a² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0, so a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a =
