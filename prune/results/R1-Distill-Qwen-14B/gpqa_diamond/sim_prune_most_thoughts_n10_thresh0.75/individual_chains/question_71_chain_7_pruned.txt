Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We're told they have the same albedo, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / (distance^2) )^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe I should simplify it. Oh right, the formula is often approximated as T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, perhaps it's T = T_star * ( ( (1 - a) ) / ( (1 AU)^2 * (period ratio)^2 ) )^(1/4) )? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the key factors are the distance from the star and the planet's reflectivity (albedo). Since all planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - a) / (16πσ) )^(1/4) * (L/(4πσ))^1/4 * (1/distance)^1/2. Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) / ( (1 - a_star) )^(1/4) )

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Let me think about the formula. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but wait, no. Wait, the formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - a)^(1/4) ) * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) )
