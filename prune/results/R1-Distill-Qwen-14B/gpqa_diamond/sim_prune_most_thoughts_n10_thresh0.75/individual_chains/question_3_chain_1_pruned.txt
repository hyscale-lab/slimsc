Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about expectation values, right? I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I think |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. So sigma_z is the Pauli z-matrix, right? And the operator given is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator and then sum them up.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let me find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, calculating their expectation values should be straightforward. The state is a superposition: (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So the state vector ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, but when computing the expectation value of σ_z, I think the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. Because σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So for the state ψ, the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability of being in |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Let me compute that. sqrt(3)/2 squared is 3/4. So 0.25 and 0.75.

So the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, is that right? Yeah, because 25% chance of +1, 75% of -1. That would average to 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So the contribution from 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the other part is 5⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, not σ_x.

Wait, what's the matrix form of σ_x? It's [[0,1],[1,
