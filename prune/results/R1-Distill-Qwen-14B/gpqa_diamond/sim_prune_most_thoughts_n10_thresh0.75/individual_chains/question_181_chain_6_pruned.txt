Okay, so I've got this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino stuff, but I'll try to remember.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still happening normally. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1/flux2.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main process in the Sun's core for converting hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, but the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce boron-8. I think that's the one that emits a lot of neutrinos, specifically the ones we detect on Earth. Oh right, the pp-III branch is responsible for the 700-800 keV neutrinos because of the Beryllium-7 capturing a proton to become Boron-8, which then decays and emits a neutrino.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos (like in band 1 and maybe others) would stop. But wait, the problem says the pp-III stopped, not all of them. So other branches of the proton-proton chain, like pp-I and pp-II, are still running, right? Or wait, I'm not sure if pp-I and pp-II are the same as the other branches. Maybe the main branches are pp-I and pp-II, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the pp chain typically has two main branches. The main branch (I think called pp-I) leads to the production of helium-4, and it doesn't produce as many neutrinos. The other branch, pp-II, is the Boron-8 one, which does produce neutrinos around 700-800 keV. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps pp-III isn't the main one. Hmm, maybe I should stop here and think about the neutrino production.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop. But what about the other branches? Are their neutrino emissions in the same energy range?

I remember the dominant solar neutrinos come from two main processes: the dominant one is the proton-proton chain, which produces neutrinos with energies around 250-300 keV. Wait no, that's from the main branch (pp-I). The other branch, which involves boron-8, emits higher energy neutrinos, around 15-20 MeV, but wait, no, wait, that's not right either. Hold on, I think I'm mixing up things.

Wait, the boron-8 decay produces a neutrino with a higher energy than the ones from the main pp chain. Let me think again. The main pp chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos via the process where a helium-3 captures two protons to form helium-4, but wait, that's not the main one. Oh wait,
