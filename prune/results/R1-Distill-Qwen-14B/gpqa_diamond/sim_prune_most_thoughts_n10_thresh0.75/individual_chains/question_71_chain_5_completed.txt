Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the distance from the star. Oh, the inverse square root of the distance actually. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, so the temperature, which depends on the fourth root of flux, would go as the inverse square root of distance.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm a bit confused. Or maybe it's more about the ratio of their temperatures based on their orbital periods, which relates to their distances. Since they're in orbital resonance, their periods are in the given ratios.

The problem states that the planets have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 P3 = 2.5*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, Planet_5 P5=5*P1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star). Since all the planets have circular orbits, a is the radius. So for each planet, (P_i)^2 ∝ a_i^3. So a_i ∝ P_i^(2/3).

So, the distance of each planet from the star is proportional to P^(2/3). So to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I need to find the ratio of their distances, then adjust the temperature based on that.

Equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T ∝ (L/(4πσd²))^(1/4) = (L/(d²))^(1/4) * (1/(4πσ))^(1/4). So T ∝ 1/(d^(1/2)).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (d2) / (d4) )

Because if T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then T4 = k / sqrt(d4), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So their ratio is sqrt(d2/d4).

So first, find the ratio of their periods. Planet_2 has period P2 = 2*P1, Planet_4 has P4=3.5*P1.

The ratio P2/P4 is (2 P1)/(3.5 P1) = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.571.

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), so the distance ratio d2/d4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, let me think again: a_i ∝ P_i^(2/3), so d2 = a2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * a1, but a1 is the distance for Planet_1. Similarly, d4 = a4 = (P4/P1)^(2/3) * a1.

So d2/d4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, 2/3.5 is same as 4/7. Yeah, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So (4/7)^(2/3) is the ratio of d2 to d4.

Now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( d2 / d4 ). Let me compute that.

d2/d4 = (4/7)^(2/3) = (4^(2/3))/(7^(2/3)) )= ( (4^(1/3))^2 ) / (7^(2/3)) )

But 4 is 2^2, so 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). So 4^(2/3) is (2^(2/3))^2 = 2^(4/3).

Similarly, 7^(2/3) is (7^(1/3))^2.

So d2/d4 = [2^(4/3)] / [7^(2/3)] = (2^2 /7)^(1/3) )? Wait, not exactly. Alternatively, 4^2 is 16, and 7^2 is 49, so (4/7)^2 is 16/49. Then (4/7)^(2/3) is the same as the cube root of (16/49).

So the cube root of 16 is approximately 2.5198, and cube root of 49 is around 3.6593. So 2.5198 /3.6593 ≈ 0.689.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately. Wait, 16/49 is approximately 0.3265. The cube root of 0.3265 is about 0.69. Because 0.7^3 is 0.343, which is a bit higher. So 0.69^3 is about 0.3285. So 0.69 is close.

So d2/d4 ≈ 0.69. Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(0.69) ≈ 0.8306.

Wait, sqrt(0.69) is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me compute (4/7)^(2/3) numerically.

4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Taking 0.5714 to the power of (2/3). Let's calculate that.

First, ln(0.5714) ≈ -0.554.

Multiply by 2/3: -0.554 * 2/3 ≈ -0.369.

Exponential of that is e^-0.369 ≈ 0.691.

So (4/7)^(2/3) ≈ 0.691.

So d2/d4 ≈ 0.691.

Then T4/T2 = sqrt(0.691) ≈ sqrt(0.69) ≈ 0.8306, which is about 0.83.

So the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's is approximately 0.83.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me think again. Since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a4). Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Wait, because T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2/a4 )

Ah, yes. So, earlier calculation was correct. So the ratio is sqrt( d2/d4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3) ) * (2/3.5)^(1/3). Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it another way.

Wait, wait, let me compute (4/7)^(2/3) first, then take sqrt of that. Because T4/T2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt( x^(2/3) ) = x^(1/3).

So, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express:

d2/d4 = [ (P2/P4) ]^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

Then, T4/T2 = sqrt( d2/d4 ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Ah, right. Because sqrt(x^(2/3)) is x^(1/3).

So now, (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of 4/7.

4 is approximately 4, 7 is 7, so 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is about what? Let's think.

0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.83^3 is approx 0.83*0.83=0.6889, 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh, exactly! So 0.83^3 ≈ (0.83)*(0.83)=0.6889; then 0.6889 *0.83.

Wait, 0.6889 *0.8 = 0.55112.

0.6889 *0.03=0.020667.

So total 0.55112 +0.020667= 0.571787.

Which is about 0.5718, which is very close to 4/7 (0.571428...). So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83.

Therefore, T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

So, the correct answer is option C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance from the star, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the distances of the planets from the star are proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

For Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), respectively. The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{2/3}.
\]

Taking the cube root of \( \frac{4}{7} \), we find:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{2/3}} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{T_4}{T_2} \approx 0.83 \).

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.
