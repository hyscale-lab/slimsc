Okay, so I just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The PI gave me four plasmid options, and I need to choose the right one. Hmm, where do I begin?

The protein sequence provided is the amino acid sequence of P53. I remember that when cloning a gene into a plasmid for expression, the plasmid must have the correct reading frame and appropriate start and stop codons. Also, E. coli uses certain codons more frequently, so the plasmid's compatibility with the host is key.

Looking at the options A, B, C, D—each is a DNA sequence, but I need to find which one correctly encodes the Human P53 protein. I think the plasmid should contain the coding sequence (CDS) of the gene in frame, with a start (methionine) and stop codon.

Wait, plasmids often have a multiple cloning site (MCS) where the gene is inserted. The start codon (ATG) is usually at the beginning, and the stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) at the end. So I should look for each plasmid's DNA sequence to see if it starts with ATG and ends with a stop codon, and whether the rest matches the P53 sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmids are variants with different features, like promoters, ribosome binding sites, or origins of replication. But since the question is about the amino acid sequence, the focus is on the coding region.

Another thought: maybe the plasmids have introns or other sequences, but for E. coli, which doesn't do splicing, the coding sequence should be continuous and in frame.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCA... Wait, the first few nucleotides are ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG.... Wait, the first ATG is the start codon, but the next nucleotides form the mRNA. Wait, DNA is in the 5' to 3' direction, so the coding strand is from ATG onwards.

Wait, each plasmid starts with ATG, which is good because it's the start codon. So all four options have the right start. But I need to check the rest.

Another angle: the presence of a stop codon. The P53 protein's sequence ends with a certain amino acid, so the DNA should end with a stop codon.

Looking at the end of each plasmid's sequence. Let's see:

Option A: Ends with ...AGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA. The last few nucleotides are ACTGA. ACTGA is the DNA sequence. The corresponding mRNA would be UCTGA, but wait, let me think. Wait, DNA is double-stranded, but the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T→U. So the last part would be 'ACTGA', which in mRNA is '
