Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the probability of measuring a particular observable value. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is a column vector in a Hilbert space, which in this case is three-dimensional.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So I should write this out as a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators. I should check if matrix P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, I see that all the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let's see: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), so the (2,1) element is same, which it is. Similarly, (2,3) and (3,2) are both 1/sqrt(2). The (1,3) and (3,1) are zero. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good, that makes sense for an observable.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that a measurement of the observable P yields 0. To find this, I need to find the eigenvalues of P, identify which eigenvalue is 0, and then compute the probability associated with that eigenvalue.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: if P is a projection operator, then maybe it's a projection onto a certain eigenspace. But I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, it's possible that 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and we want the probability that the system is in the corresponding eigenspace.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues that include 0. So, when we measure P, we can get 0, or other eigenvalues. So the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of P is given by the state's bra-ket product with P. But here, we don't need the expectation; we need the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

So, first step: find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P.

Matrix P:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me write this matrix explicitly.

P = [ [0, 1
