Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: the pion's mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The options are four pairs of kinetic energies, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the products must have equal and opposite momenta. But I'm not sure how that affects their kinetic energies yet. I think I need to consider energy and momentum conservation here.

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. The energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny mass, almost considered massless. So, I can probably treat the neutrino as a massless particle. That might simplify things.

Let me write down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation:
m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation:
0 = p_mu + p_nu (since they must be equal and opposite vectors, their magnitudes are equal but opposite directions)

Wait, but since they are opposite, perhaps their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, the vectors sum to zero. So, I can consider their magnitudes as equal.

So, perhaps I can write:

p_mu = p_nu = p

Wait, but for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu c. Because for a photon (which is also massless), E = pc. But neutrinos are similar in this aspect. So, E_nu = p * c.

Similarly, for the muon, which has mass, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So, plugging these into the energy equation:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) + p c

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me denote m_pi as M, m_mu as m, and p as the magnitude of momentum. So:

M c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + m^2 c^4 ) + p c

Let me rearrange this equation:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + m^2 c^4 ) = (M c^2 - p c )

Wait, I wonder if dividing both sides by c will make it easier. Let me try:

sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) = (M c^2 - p c )

Divide both sides by c:

sqrt( p^2 + m^2 c^2 ) = M c - p

Wait, now square both sides:

p^2 + m^2 c^2 = (M c - p )^2

Expanding the right side:

(M c)^2 - 2 M c p + p^2

So,

p^2 + m^2 c^2 = M^2 c^2 - 2 M c p + p^2

Cancel out p^2 from both sides:

m^2 c^2 = M^2 c^2 - 2 M c p

Hmm, solving for p:

2 M c p = M^2 c^2 - m^2 c^2

Divide both sides by 2 M c:

p = ( M^2 c^2 - m^2 c^2 ) / (2 M c )

Factor out c^2 in numerator:

p = c ( M^2 - m^2 ) / ( 2 M )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. Oh wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Since all the masses are given in MeV/c², and c= 1 in these units (MeV and c=1), so maybe I can ignore c in the calculations.

Wait, in particle physics, when using MeV, we often set c=1, so E (in MeV) is equal to m c^2 when the particle is at rest. So, m (in MeV/c²) multiplied by c² gives MeV. But when calculating p, which is in MeV/c, because p = gamma m v, but with c=1, v is in fractions of c, so perhaps p is in MeV/c.

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in units where c=1. Then, m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So, let's let c=1. Then, the equation simplifies.

So, back to the equation:

p = ( M² - m² ) / ( 2 M )

Because the c factors would cancel. So, M is the pion mass: 139.6, m is muon mass: 105.7.

Compute numerator: M² = (139.6)^2, m² = (105.7)^2.

Let me calculate M²: 139.6 squared.

139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

139^2 is 19321. Let me compute 139.6^2:

(139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6².

139² = 19321.

2*139*0.6 = 2*139 * 0.6 = 278 * 0.6 = 166.8.

0.6² = 0.36.

So total is 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 167.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu=105.7, so m² is 105.7^2.

105^2 is 11025.

0.7^2 is 0.49.

2*105*0.7 = 147.

So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So, M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that.

19488.16 - 11172.49:

Subtract 11,000 from 19,488.16: 8,488.16.

Then subtract 172.49: 8,488.16 -172.49 = 8,315.67.

So numerator is 8315.67, denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = (8315.67) / (279.2) ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So it's about 29.8 or so.

Wait, wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 8315.67 is less by 8376 - 8315.67 = 60.33.

So, 60.33/(279.2) ≈ 0.216.

So, 29.8 - 0.216 ≈ 29.584.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me try 279.2 × 29.8 = ?

279.2
