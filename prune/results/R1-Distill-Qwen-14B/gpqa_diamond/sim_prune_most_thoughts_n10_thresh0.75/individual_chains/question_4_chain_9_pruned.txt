Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, right, in our universe, magnets always have both poles—like how a bar magnet has two ends, north and south. But if you could have isolated poles, that would change things.

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. The four equations are about divergence and curl of E and B fields, and charge and current distributions. Let me think about each equation.

First, the divergence of B: normally, Maxwell's equation says that the divergence of B is zero. So, ∇·B = 0. That equation arises because magnetic monopoles don't exist in our universe. Each magnetic field line starts and ends on a dipole, not an isolated pole. But if you could have isolated north or south poles, that would mean the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. So that equation would change. Because a monopole would act like a source or sink for the magnetic field lines. So equation one would be different.

Next, the other equations. The divergence of E is related to the charge density. That's Gauss's law, right? ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. I don't think that changes because electric charges can be isolated (like electrons or protons), so that equation stays the same.

What about Faraday's Law? That's the curl of E. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I think that equation deals with changing magnetic fields and induced electric fields. If you have monopoles, does that change Faraday's Law? Hmm, not directly. Faraday's Law is about the changing B causing a circulating E. Monopoles might not affect that directly, but maybe the other equation would change.

Oh wait, the other equation is Ampère's Law, which in the original form is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But with monopoles, I think there's an additional term. Wait, in Maxwell's equations, the introduction of magnetic monopoles would imply that the divergence of B is non-zero, which is one change. But also, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction already includes the displacement current. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no—Ampère's Law (the curl of B) relates to currents. If there are magnetic charges, maybe there's a term involving the current of magnetic charge. Or perhaps the equation that changes is the one with the divergence of B, not the curl.

Wait, the options given are about which equations are different. The question says which of Maxwell's equations are different in this scenario.

So, in our universe, there are two main equations that could change if magnetic monopoles exist. The first is the divergence of B, which would no longer be zero. The second is the equation involving the curl of E. Wait, why would that change?

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, would that affect the Faraday's Law equation (curl E)? I thought Faraday's Law is about changing B fields, so even with monopoles, that equation might change. Or perhaps not. Wait, no. Let me think. If there's a magnetic current density (like a flow of magnetic monopoles), the
