Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When you add an acid to it, the hydroxide reacts with the H+ ions from the acid. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water, right?

So the reaction equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, wait. Let me balance that. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. Each H+ will react with one OH- to form water. So yeah, 3 H+ ions are needed per Fe(OH)3 molecule.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let's calculate the moles.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So, 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009357 mol, yeah.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 is about 0.000936 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve completely. So the moles of H+ needed are 0.000936 mol * 3 = 0.002808 mol.

Wait, but the acid provided is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed can be calculated using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranging, volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. That's about 28.08 cm³, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough.

Wait, but wait a second. The total solution volume is 100 cm³. Does that affect anything? Oh, right, because when you add the acid, the total volume could change. But wait, the question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." So perhaps we're assuming that the acid is being added to the 100 cm³ solution, but wait, wait, no. Because the 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid? Or is it the initial volume before adding acid?

Wait, the question says we dissolve the Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. So the 100 cm³ is the final volume after dissolving. So when you add the acid, the volume of the acid itself contributes to the total volume. But this is a bit tricky because when you add a small volume of acid (like 28 cm³) to 100 cm³, the total might not be exactly 100. Hmm. But maybe the question simplifies it by considering the acid volume as part of the
