Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial step is probably to calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M? Wait, no, 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, and 40 cm³ is 0.04 L, so 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M? Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid in diluted solution is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (moles)/Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait: the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

25% titration would mean 25% of the equivalence point volume is used. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has
