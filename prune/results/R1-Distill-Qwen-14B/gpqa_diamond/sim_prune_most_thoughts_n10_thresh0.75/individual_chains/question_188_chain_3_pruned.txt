Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. But wait, how do I calculate that for a rhombohedral structure?

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, but the angles between the edges are the same, right? Oh wait, no, the problem says the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with each angle 30 degrees. But wait, isn't a rhombohedral structure a special case of a hexagonal system or something else? Maybe I should think in terms of the general formula for interplanar distances.

I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos beta + hl cos gamma + kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, wait. Or is that for a general triclinic system? Because rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, and the angles are all the same.

So in this case, since it's a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula, I think the general formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos α + kl cos β) )

Wait, but wait, I might have to double-check the formula. Because I think sometimes the formula is different based on the type of crystal.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can also be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hkl)(sqrt(3)) ] )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should go back to the general formula for a rhombohedral system.

In a rhombohedral system, the structure is a special case where a = b = c and the angles are all equal (though not necessarily 90 degrees). So
