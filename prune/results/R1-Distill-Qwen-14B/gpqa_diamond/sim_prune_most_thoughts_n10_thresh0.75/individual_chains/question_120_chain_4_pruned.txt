Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. 

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Oh right, when we count stars, the number depends on the volume of space they occupy. Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume up to that distance.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if I consider a range of distances from d to d+dd, the volume would be proportional to (d)^3, since the change in volume for a thin shell is 4πd² dd. Wait, right, because the volume between d and d+dd is the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd). So the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But wait, the problem is about parallax. Since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, d is 1/p. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (d d). Hmm, but we need to express it in terms of plx.

Wait, if plx is p, then d = 1/p. So the volume element in terms of p would involve the derivative. Let me think about how to change variables from d to p.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the volume, which is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, when p changes by dp, what's the corresponding dd?

Wait, let's express d as 1/p. So when p increases by dp, d decreases by (dd). Let me compute dd in terms of dp. d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're dealing with positive dp and dd, I'll take the absolute value. So dd = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting back into the volume element:

Volume element ∝ 4π (d)^2 dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the volume
