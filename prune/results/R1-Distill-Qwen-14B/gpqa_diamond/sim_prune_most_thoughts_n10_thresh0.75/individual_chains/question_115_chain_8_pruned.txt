Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

An electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, so that's the positive x-direction maybe? Its Lorentz factor is 4. The positron is moving from the right, so that's the negative x-direction, right? Its Lorentz factor is 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, photon directions. Since both are moving to the right, but one is upper and one is lower. So they must be symmetric about the x-axis. Wait, but why would they be symmetric? Because the system before collision is symmetric in some way. Let me think.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum should be zero. So maybe the photons are emitted symmetrically. But wait, the initial situation isn't symmetric because the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So the electron has gamma =4, and the positron gamma=2. Their speeds are different because gamma is different.

Wait, but when they annihilate, energy and momentum must be conserved. So I think I need to compute the total energy and total momentum before annihilation, then figure out the energies and directions of the photons.

So first, find the total energy and momentum of the system before collision.

Electron and positron have same mass, but opposite charges. But since they are moving in opposite directions, their momentum vectors are opposite.

Wait, electron is moving to the right (say, +x) with gamma 4. Positron is moving to the left (–x) with gamma 2.

Wait, no. The positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving left to right, the positron is moving right to left. Wait, no, the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right. So, perhaps it's moving left, towards the electron.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so going right. The positron is moving from the right, so going left. So they approach each
