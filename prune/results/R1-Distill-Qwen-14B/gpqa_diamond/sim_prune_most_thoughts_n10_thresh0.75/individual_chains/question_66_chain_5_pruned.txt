Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that are compatible with the Standard Model's symmetries, right? So the operators are constructed respecting certain symmetries.

First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Lorentz symmetry involves rotations and boosts, while Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations (like spacetime translations). Oh right, Poincare is a bigger group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if Poincare is respected, then Lorentz must be too. But wait, do SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare symmetry? Because I think SMEFT is built in a way that the Lagrangian respects Poincare. So operators should also respect Poincare, meaning they must respect Lorentz as well.

So looking at the options, if 2 (Poincare) is required, then 1 (Lorentz) must also be required. So options A and C include both 1 and 2. Options B and D don't have both, so they can be ruled out for that reason.

Next, CP symmetry. I'm a bit confused about this. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. In the Standard Model, some processes violate CP, like in the CKM mechanism. So in SMEFT, do they have to respect CP? Or can operators violate it? I think the operators in SMEFT are not required to preserve CP. Because SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators that can lead to CP violation. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? Oh, I remember that in quantum field theory, all interactions must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a fundamental symmetry of nature. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect CPT. That would mean 4 is a must.

So putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect?

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 1 and 2. So Lorentz and Poincare. But what about CPT? Do all operators have to respect CPT? Because I thought CPT is a must. So option A doesn't include 4, so that can't be right.

Option C: 1, 2, 4. So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Oh that includes all three, but what about CP? No, because 3 is not in C's selection. But the question is about which must be respected. Since CP isn't required, the correct ones are 1,2,4.

Wait, the options are A) 1,2; C) 1,2,4. So the correct option would be C, because C includes 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT operators can violate CP, right? So 3 is not a must. So the operators
