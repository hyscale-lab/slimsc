Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, let me think. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, you need a way to make sense of them by introducing a cutoff or something similar.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So I need to go through each option and think about whether each theory has these problems.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, I think string theory is different because it's a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and their interactions are different. But I'm not sure if it needs regularization. I know that superstring theory is a candidate for quantum gravity, so maybe it doesn't have the same divergences as other QFTs. Or does it? Or perhaps it's the only one that doesn't require it because it's a background-independent theory or something. Or maybe it's because higher-dimensional theories automatically handle some divergences? Hmm, not too clear. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. So perturbative methods work better there. But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think it does because loop diagrams can still lead to divergences. Regularization methods like lattice QCD or dimensional regularization are used. So B would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory, but I remember that even QED requires renormalization because of divergent loop integrals. So you need to regularize the integrals, maybe using a cutoff or other methods. So C does require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, this is different because it's a classical theory, not a quantum one. Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences that come from quantum fluctuations. Like, in classical electromagnetism, you might have issues with the self-energy of charges, but I think these are more conceptual and handled through the use of the Lorenz gauge or other formalisms without needing regularization techniques. But wait, in reality, classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum ones because they don't involve the same mathematical structures. So D doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe D is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. For quantum theories, high energies can lead to problems that need regularization, but classical theories don't have that. So the question is which theory never requires regularization. Since D is classical, it's not a quantum field theory so it doesn't need regularization. So the answer is D.

Wait, but let me make sure. Which other theories don't need regularization? String theory is quantum, but maybe it doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory. Or because the mathematics is such that the divergences are naturally tamed. Or perhaps in superstring theories, the high-energy behavior is better, but I'm not sure if they avoid regularization entirely.
