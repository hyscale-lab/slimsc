Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just a method of discovery.

The problem gives me two sets of ratios. The first is the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.4 and T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. So, T1 is hotter than T2, which is hotter than T3.

Then there's the mass ratios. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, M1/M2 ≈ 1.15 and M2/M3 ≈ 1.35. So, Planet1 is more massive than Planet2, which is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. So, we need to find P3/P1.

The albedo for all three planets is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so it's the same for all, which might simplify things because the formula for equilibrium temperature probably includes albedo.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature of a planet is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Alternatively, the formula can be written as T = T_earth * sqrt(R_sun/(2D)) * (L/L_sun)^(1/4), but I'm not sure. Wait, another way: T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), assuming same albedo and other factors. Because the star's luminosity is L, and the planet is at distance D.

But wait, because the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star (I assume, because it's a system of three planets), then L and a are the same for all planets. So, the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance: T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). Because from the formula, T scales as (L/(D²))^(1/4), which is (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Wait, or maybe I should write that as T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). But since L is the same for all planets, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So, the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of their distances.

So, let's write that out. For Planet1 and Planet2:

T1 / T2 = (sqrt(D2) / sqrt(D1)) )^(-1) = sqrt(D1/D2). Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let me think again. Since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2), right? Because T1 = (1/sqrt(D1)) * k, T2 = (1/sqrt(D2)) *k. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait no, wait: T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2=k/sqrt(D2). So, T1/T2 = (sqrt(D2)/sqrt(D1)) ) = sqrt(D2/D1).

Yes, that's right. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Given that, the first ratio T1/T2 is approximately 1.4. So,

1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1)

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = D2/D1 --> D2 = 1.96 * D1.

So, the distance of Planet2 is about 1.96 times that of Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3.

Since T2 is hotter than T3, that means Planet3 is farther away than Planet2. Using the same formula:

T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) --> 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2)

Squaring both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2 --> D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But since D2 is 1.96 * D1, then D3 =5.29 *1.96 * D1.

Let me calculate that: 5.29 *1.96.

Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately:

5.29 * 1.96.

Let me compute 5 * 1.96 =9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total ≈9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So D3≈10.3684 * D1.

So, the distances are D1 (Planet1), D2≈1.96 D1, D3≈10.3684 D1.

Now, we need to relate the orbital periods to these distances. The orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ D³, assuming the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses, which is usually the case. So, P² = (4π² G⁻¹ M_star⁻¹) D³. So, P ∝ D^(3/2).

So, the orbital period of each planet is proportional to D^(3/2). So, the
