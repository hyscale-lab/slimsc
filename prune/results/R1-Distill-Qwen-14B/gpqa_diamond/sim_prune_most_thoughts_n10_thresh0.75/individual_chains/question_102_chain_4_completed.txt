Okay, so I have this pretty complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment done to study their developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with loxP and lox2272 cassettes, which I remember are used for Cre/loxP recombination, allowing for the excision of certain regions.

So the vector structure is as follows:
- 5' end has the ligand ORF, which is fused to mCherry. Between them, there's a stop cassette in loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, possibly constitutive.

Then comes the IRES element, which is a Regulatory Element that allows internal ribosome entry. IRES typically allows the translation of a second ORF in the same mRNA, so after the ligand's mRNA, the IRES will help in the translation of the receptor.

The receptor ORF is after the IRES, and it's fused to eGFP. Between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette using lox2272. So when Cre is present, these stop cassettes can be excised, allowing expression of the downstream genes (mCherry and eGFP).

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. So the vector has two coding regions: ligand and receptor. The ligand is first, under CBA, followed by IRES, then the receptor with eGFP.

The setup is that the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. But the stops are in place, so without Cre, the stops prevent the downstream tags from being expressed. But when Cre is introduced, the lox sites are recognized, and the stops are removed, so the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) can be expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected this plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures. They raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, so that's loading control.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for their construct in the wild-type background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, but they don't see any.

So why is there no green signal? The green would be from eGFP, which is linked to the receptor. The construct was supposed to express the receptor-eGFP when Cre is present, but in the mouse, it's not happening.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the construct is for the same cell? Because the vector has both ligand and receptor. But I'm not sure how that would affect the eGFP expression. Maybe if the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but the GFP is on the receptor, so it should be in the same cell. Not sure if this is relevant here.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct was stuck, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? The vector has the ORF, so if the construct is correctly spliced, it should be fine. Also, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed if the stop is removed. But the problem here is that the mouse model didn't show any expression. Maybe the construct wasn't properly recombined or the eGFP is not getting expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If there's no enhancer, the promoters won't drive expression. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The CBA promoter is known to be a strong, constitutive promoter, so maybe it's not enhancer-dependent. The IRES is for the receptor, but if the enhancer is missing, maybe the receptor isn't expressed. But wait, in the vector setup, the ligand is under CBA, so even without an enhancer, it should be expressed. However, if both the ligand and receptor are not expressed, then the eGFP won't be there either. But the initial Western blot test after transfecting the plasmid showed signals, so maybe in the cells, they were expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression is not happening because of the promoter setup. But the question says they used the CBA promoter for ligand, so maybe the mouse's expression relies on that.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's a possibility. If the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't removed correctly, the eGFP won't be expressed. The stop cassette is lox2272, which is a different lox site than loxP. Cre recognizes loxP sites, but maybe the lox2272 requires a different recombinase, like Dre or another Cre variant. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, but it's recognized by Cre. Or perhaps, in this setup, the Cre used can't efficiently cut the lox2272 sites. Wait, but the vector has loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So the ligand's stop is in loxP, and the receptor's stop is in lox2272. So the Cre would only act on the loxP sites. So the ligand's expression is under CBA, and the stop is flanked by loxP. So when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites would be cut, and the stop cassette would be removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed in the same frame as the ligand. Similarly, the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, but Cre can't cut that? Or perhaps, in this setup, the IRES is after the ligand, so the receptor is under the control of the IRES. Wait, in the vector, the ligand is first, under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor with eGFP and a stop in lox2272.

Wait, the IRES allows for the expression of the receptor as a separate ORF. So the ligand is expressed under CBA, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate mRNA. But the stop between ligand and mCherry is loxP, and the stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272.

So when the Cre is introduced, the loxP sites around the ligand's stop are cut, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry. And the lox2272 sites around the receptor's stop would also be cut, allowing the receptor to be expressed with eGFP.

But wait, if the Cre is only able to cut loxP, not lox2272, then the receptor's stop wouldn't be removed, and the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So if the Cre used in the experiment can't cut lox2272, then the stop remains, and the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't made.

In the setup, the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So the Cre should be expressed in those cells, which would recombine the loxP sites. But the lox2272 sites are different. I'm not sure if Cre can recognize lox2272, or if it's a different recombinase.

Wait, lox2272 is a mutant lox site that can still be recognized by Cre but has a different recombination efficiency. So Cre can still cut it, but maybe not as efficiently as loxP. So if the recombination isn't efficient enough, the stop cassette in the receptor-eGFP might not be excised, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the loxP sites in the ligand's cassette, but the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, so Cre doesn't cut them, leaving the stop in place. That would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning it's designed to express two proteins from the same transcript. So the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. The IRES allows the receptor's expression. But the IRES is after the ligand. So in the vector, without Cre, the ligand is followed by a stop in loxP, so mCherry is not expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop in lox2272, so eGFP isn't expressed.

When Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed. But if the Cre can't cut the lox2272 in the receptor's stop, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. I think Cre can recognize both, but perhaps with different efficiencies. So if the vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor, and the Cre can't efficiently cut lox2272, then the receptor's stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

In the mouse model, the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, the Cre would only recombine the loxP sites but not the lox2272 sites. That would mean that the ligand's stop is excised (allowing ligand-mCherry expression), but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says that after the cross, they don't see a green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. But why would that be the case?

Oh, wait! Wait a second. The vector uses IRES to separate the ligand and receptor. The IRES is after the ligand. The ligand is followed by a stop in loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor with a stop in lox2272.

So when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites around the ligand's stop are cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The IRES then allows the receptor to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

Wait, but I thought Cre can recognize lox2272. Or is it that the lox2272 is only cut by another recombinase, like Dre? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed such that the IRES is only functional if the loxP sites are recombined. Wait, no, IRES is a separate element.

Hmm. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic. Ligand is under CBA, then IRES, then receptor. The ligand's stop is in loxP-stop-loxP, the receptor's stop is in lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So when Cre is present, it can cut the loxP sites, excising the stop cassette and allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry. The IRES then allows the receptor to be expressed, but the stop cassette in lox2272 is still present unless another recombinase cuts it. But the Cre can't cut lox2272, so the stop remains, which would prevent the eGFP from being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor, allowing their separate expression. But without the stops being removed, the IRES might not function properly.

Wait, another thought: the stop cassettes are placed after each ORF. So the ligand is followed by a stop in loxP, and the receptor by a stop in lox2272. So without Cre, the stops prevent the tags from being expressed. When Cre is present, it cuts the loxP sites, removing the stop, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

So in the mouse model, when they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre can only recombine the loxP sites, excising the ligand's stop, but the receptor's stop remains. So eGFP isn't expressed, which is why there's no green signal.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, if the stop remains, then the eGFP isn't expressed at all. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed, which is because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

Wait, but the options don't mention anything about the Cre not cutting the sites. They just give possible reasons for no eGFP.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the proteins would be receptor followed by a stop, then eGFP. So without the stop being removed, the receptor would be made, but the eGFP wouldn't be. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no fluorescence.

So why is the stop not removed? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state that. So looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, that would mean that the eGFP is out of frame, so it's not expressed correctly. But in this case, the stop is preventing expression, not the frame.

Alternatively, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, which could be due to the stop being in place, which is because Cre can't remove it.

But the options don't address the Cre's inability to cut the lox2272.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the IRES is located after the ligand, so once the ligand is expressed, the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But if the stop is still present in the receptor's region, the eGFP won't be expressed. So perhaps the IRES isn't working because the stop is still present.

Wait, but IRES is an internal ribosome entry site. It allows the translation of the second ORF without the need for a stop codon in between. So if the ligand is expressed, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed regardless of the stop. Hmm, but the stop is before the eGFP.

Wait, the vector structure is:

5' - [CBA promoter] - ligand ORF - stop cassette (loxP) - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - stop cassette (lox2272) - eGFP - 3'

Wait, no, perhaps the ORFs are in the same direction. So the structure is:

5' [CBA] --> ligand ORF --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry --> IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP 3'

Wait, that can't be right. I think the vector is designed so that the ligand is in the 5' ORF, followed by the receptor in the 3' ORF, with IRES in between.

Wait, no, the ligand is at the 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP.

So the construct is:

5' [CBA] --> ligand ORF --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry --> IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP 3'

So when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites around the ligand's stop are cut, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed together. The IRES then allows the receptor ORF and eGFP to be expressed, but only if the stop in lox2272 is cut.

If the stop in lox2272 isn't cut, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So if the Cre used can't cut the lox2272 sites, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

But the options don't mention anything about the Cre's ability to cut the sites. So looking for another angle.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't properly expressed.

Wait, but the frame would only be an issue if the ORF is incorrectly reading. But the vector's design presumably puts them in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working correctly. But IRES allows for the expression of the second ORF regardless of the first.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functional when the stop is present. No, I don't think so. The IRES is after the stop, so when the stop is cut, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in this setup, the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. So the ligand is expressed, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But if the IRES is before the receptor's stop, then the stop would prevent eGFP expression.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't strong enough, or the promoter isn't active.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is D because the stop isn't removed, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly state that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the IRES is in the same orientation as the first ORF. So when the ligand is expressed, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is in a separate reading frame. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working because the loxP site hasn't been cut, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the vector's bicistronic construct is such that the IRES is after the ligand, so the ligand is expressed first, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But for the IRES to function, the stop after the ligand must be removed. So if the stop isn't removed (because the lox2272 isn't cut), the IRES can't function, and the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the IRES is downstream of the ligand, so if the ligand's stop is still present (without loxP recombination), the IRES wouldn't be in frame, possibly preventing the receptor's expression.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Let me try to think about each part again.

In the vector:

- The ligand is at 5', under a strong promoter (CBA). After the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette in loxP. Then comes mCherry.

- Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF. After the receptor ORF, there's a stop cassette in lox2272. Then comes eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is introduced, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand fusion. The IRES then allows the receptor ORF to be expressed, but only if the stop in lox2272 is cut.

If the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which can only cut loxP. So the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's stop isn't.

Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the options don't have anything about Cre's inability to cut lox2272.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If there's no enhancer, the CBA promoter might not be active. But the Western blot showed expression, so the promoter worked in cell culture. In the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't driven as well, but why would that lead to no eGFP? If the promoter isn't active, neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the question is about eGFP not being expressed, which is receptor-related.

Alternatively, perhaps the CBA promoter is not active in the cells being visualized. But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, so the receptors should be expressed there.

Another option: the expression cassettes are not under the right promoters. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed, they should be in frame. If the ORFs are in the same frame, then eGFP would be expressed. So if they aren't in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed even if the stop is removed. But the problem here is that the stop isn't removed, not the frame.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working because the loxP site isn't cut, but that doesn't directly affect the frame.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is under a separate promoter. No, the setup says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So it's part of the same ORF.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option B says the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't reach the cell surface and wouldn't fluoresce. But why would it be stuck? The vector design seems correct. Maybe it's a processing issue, but I'm not sure.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no fluorescence. But why would they not be in frame? Because the stop isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't translated.

Wait, no. If the stop is present, the translation stops at the stop codon, so eGFP isn't made at all. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed, not the frame.

But the options don't address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D for another reason. Maybe the eGFP is out of frame because the stop is still there, but that's not how it works. The stop codon would just terminate translation, so the eGFP isn't made.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor, but without the lox2272 being cut, the eGFP is not expressed because the IRES doesn't function.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the Cre is not active, so the stops aren't cut. But the Cre is active in SOX10-expressing cells, so in the offspring, the Cre should be active.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous, and the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, which are derived from the ectoderm. So the ligand and receptor should have their stops cut, leading to expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But in the result, only the ligand's stop is cut (mCherry is expressed), and the receptor's stop isn't (eGFP isn't expressed).

So the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't have that as an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But if the stop isn't cut, they're not in frame because the stop is in between. Wait, no, the frame is determined by the reading frame of the ORF. If the stop is in place, the eGFP's ORF isn't even started. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed, not the frame.

So none of the options directly address this, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the vector could have a problem in the way the ORFs are arranged. The stop between the ligand and mCherry is in loxP, so when Cre cuts, mCherry is now in frame with the ligand. Similarly, the stop between receptor and eGFP is in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut that, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't in frame because the stop wasn't removed. But that's not frame; it's just not expressed.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe the answer is D because the eGFP isn't in frame, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is under a different promoter or the vector's design isn't allowing its expression. But the question doesn't suggest that.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES may not be functional in the context of the vector. The IRES allows for the expression of the second ORF, but if the first ORF's stop isn't removed, maybe the IRES isn't effective. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design is such that the IRES is only functional when the lox2272 is cut. But I don't think that's how IRES works.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. But given the options, the most plausible reason for the eGFP not being expressed is that the stop isn't removed, which would mean that the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites. Since the vector uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop, and the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) can't cut that, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But since this isn't an option, I have to look at the given options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Paracrine relationship

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi

C) Enhancer missing

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame.

If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the mouse didn't express eGFP because the lox2272 wasn't cut, but the options don't address that.

So perhaps the correct answer is D because the eGFP isn't in frame for translation.

But how? If the stop is present, the frame is irrelevant because the stop codon ends translation. So the issue is not the frame, but the presence of the stop.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 is in the same frame as the eGFP, so when the stop is present, the eGFP isn't translated, but that's not about frame.

So perhaps the answer is D because the eGFP isn't in frame, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is on the same ORF as the receptor, but the stop is in between. So without removing the stop, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is why there's no green signal. So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking again, the vector has the ligand ORF, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is followed by a stop in lox2272. So when the Cre cuts the loxP sites (in the ligand's stop), the ligand and mCherry are expressed. The IRES then allows the receptor ORF to be expressed. But the receptor is followed by a stop in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is not working because the stop isn't removed. So the IRES is after the ligand, but the stop is still present, preventing the IRES from working. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed.

But the IRES is only dependent on the presence of the stop before it. Or perhaps, the IRES is located after the ligand and allows the receptor's expression regardless of the stop.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should make a decision.

The most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. But why would that happen?

Wait, another angle: the vector was designed so that the ligand is at 5', followed by mCherry with a loxP stop. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, followed by eGFP with a lox2272 stop. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the IRES allows the receptor and eGFP to be expressed only if the lox2272 is cut.

If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

But the options don't mention anything about the lox sites. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, no. If the eGFP isn't translated because the stop is present, it's not a frame issue. So the correct answer isn't D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's option D because the eGFP isn't expressed, so the frame is an issue.

Wait, perhaps during the design, the eGFP is in a different frame, but that's unlikely because the ORFs are fused.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in a different frame, making the eGFP not in frame. But with the stop in place, the translation stops anyway.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under the control of an IRES element. The vector includes stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be excised by Cre recombinase. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. After crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under fluorescence microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship refers to signaling between nearby cells. However, the vector design suggests that both the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell, as the vector is bicistronic. This option does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface and would not fluoresce. However, there is no evidence in the setup to suggest that the construct is improperly processed or retained in the Golgi. The issue appears to be related to expression rather than trafficking.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The Western blot after transfection showed expression of the proteins, indicating that the promoter is functional. While the enhancer might influence tissue-specific expression, this does not directly explain why eGFP is not expressed in the mouse model.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP were not in the same reading frame, eGFP would not be expressed correctly. However, the absence of eGFP fluorescence is more likely due to the stop cassette flanking eGFP (lox2272) not being excised. Cre recombinase can recognize loxP sites but may not efficiently cut lox2272 sites. This would leave the stop cassette intact, preventing eGFP expression. While this issue is not explicitly stated in the options, it aligns most closely with the observed lack of fluorescence.  

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the stop cassette flanking the eGFP (lox2272) is not excised, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with **Option D**, as the absence of eGFP expression could result from the construct not being properly translated due to the stop cassette remaining in place.

Answer: D
