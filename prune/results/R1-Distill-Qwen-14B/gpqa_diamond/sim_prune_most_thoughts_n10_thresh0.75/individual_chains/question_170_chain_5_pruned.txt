Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Oh right, an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, so hopefully after working through, I can pick the right one.

Wait, the state is given as a vector (3i, 4). So, that's a two-component vector. I remember that for spin states, the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Oh wait, but S_y is an operator, right? So I need to figure out what the operator is.

The note says sigma_y is a matrix:
(0   -i)
(i    0)

Right, sigma matrices are used in spin operators. The spin operator S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So I can write that down: S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the state vector ψ is (3i, 4). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors. So ψ is a column vector with components [3i; 4]. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

So to compute this, I'll first compute ψ† multiplied by S_y, and then multiply by ψ.

Alternatively, since S_y is
