Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV.

Wait, wait, so what do I remember about synchrocyclotrons? Oh right, they're a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. Unlike the regular cyclotron, which has a constant magnetic field, synchrocyclotrons change the field so that the particles' orbit radius increases as they gain energy.

But wait, how does the acceleration work? In a cyclotron, particles are accelerated by an electric field that's applied alternately in the gaps between the D-shaped boxes. The frequency of this electric field is matched to the particle's cyclotron frequency so that they are always accelerated when they cross the gap.

In a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field increases over time, the particles' cyclotron frequency changes, so the frequency of the applied electric field must be adjusted accordingly. Oh right, the frequency ν(α) here depends on the phase α, which probably relates to the particle's energy.

The voltage given here is U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α)t + Φ0). The phase Φ0 is π/4, so the initial phase is 45 degrees.

But how do I find the number of revolutions? Revolutions would relate to how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching the desired energy.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each acceleration corresponds to a certain energy gain, and the number of revolutions per acceleration is what I'm after.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy gained. The kinetic energy increases from 0 to 950 MeV. Since it's injected with negligible KE, so T ≈ 0, and then it's accelerated twice to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, each acceleration step would give a certain amount of energy. Or wait, perhaps each revolution around the cyclotron corresponds to an acceleration step. So the number of revolutions would correspond to the number of times the particle circles the accelerator, each time gaining some energy.

Wait, but the process for a synchrocyclotron is that each time the particle completes a revolution, the magnetic field increases, and the frequency of the electric field changes as well. So the number of revolutions would be tied to how many times the particle can be accelerated before it reaches the target energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the number
