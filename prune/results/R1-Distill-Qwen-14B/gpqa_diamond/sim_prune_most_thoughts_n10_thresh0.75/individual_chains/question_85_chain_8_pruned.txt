Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have found them. The star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. 

The planets: Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

Now, the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio of Planet1 to Planet2's equilibrium temperatures. The options are from 0.53 to 1.30, so the ratio could be either higher or lower. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Oh right, because equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity as received by the planet, adjusted for distance and albedo.

But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So the ratio will depend on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planets' orbital distances. 

Wait, but how do we find the orbital distances a? Oh, the RV method gives us the mass and
