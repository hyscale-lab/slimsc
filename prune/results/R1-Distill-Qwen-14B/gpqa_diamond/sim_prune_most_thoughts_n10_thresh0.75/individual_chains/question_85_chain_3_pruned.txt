Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

Alright, the setup is that two planets are orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have been used. So I think the question gives us some parameters about the star and the planets. The goal is to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Oh wait, the Sun's effective temperature is about 5778 K, so this star is a bit hotter than the Sun.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and same albedo. So same albedo means the same reflectivity; that affects equilibrium temperature.

The question mentions something about Doppler shifts from forbidden lines. Wait, the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å — I think that's the wavelength. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that connects to the problem. Oh, wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. So the shift amplitude relates to the planet's mass and orbital period, I guess.

But since the question is about equilibrium temperatures, maybe the Doppler shifts are a red herring here. Because equilibrium temperature primarily depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, right, the Doppler shifts would help us find the planets' masses and orbital periods, but for equilibrium temperature, what matters is the incident flux, which depends on distance.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the orbital periods or distances. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: equilibrium temperature formula.

Equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25

Where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and albedo is the planet's reflectivity. Since albedo is the same for both, it cancels out in the ratio.

So, T_eq ratio = sqrt( R_star / (2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1).

But to find a1 and a2, we might need to use the Doppler shift information. Because the Doppler shift tells us the mass and the velocity, which relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, the Doppler method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )

But since e=0 (circular orbits), and sin i is 1 (edge-on, since transit method works), the formula simplifies. Also, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star) * (4 π²) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)) )

Wait, no, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ]

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )

But I'm more familiar with another version. Alternatively, K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1 - e²) )^0.5 ) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the formula:

K = ( ( (2 π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (2 π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the planet's orbital period.

Wait, but since the question gives the Doppler shifts in terms of wavelength (angstroms), probably we can find the velocity semi-amplitude K for each planet.

Wait, the Doppler shift is given as a shift in wavelength. The formula for Doppler shift is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

So, for each planet, we can calculate the velocity semi-amplitude K.

So, for Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

So, v1 = c * (Δλ / λ) = speed of light * (0.03 /6300 )

Similarly for Planet2, v2 = c * (0.04 /6300 )

Wait, what's c in terms of Å/s? Well, c is about 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s. But perhaps I can just compute the ratio.

Given that the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity, and since the same line is observed, the shift is directly proportional to the velocity.

So for planet 1, K1 = 0.03 /6300 ≈ 4.76e-6 in terms of wavelength shift over the star's line. Similarly, K2 = 0.04 /6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

Wait, but converting that to velocity: because v = c * (Δλ / λ).

So K1 = c * (0.03 /6300) = c * 4.76e-6.

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 /6300) = c * 6.349e-6.

So K2 is larger than K1 by a factor of (0.04 /0.03) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

Wait, but K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3))) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) ), from the formula above. Because K depends on (M_planet) and (P), the orbital period.

Wait, but if I have two planets around the same star, then K is proportional to (M_planet) * (P)^(-1/3).

Wait, let me get the formula right. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2 π c
