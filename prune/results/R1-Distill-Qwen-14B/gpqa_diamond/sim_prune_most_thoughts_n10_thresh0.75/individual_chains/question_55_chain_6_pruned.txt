Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which compound this is based on the 1H NMR data. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what I know about NMR spectroscopy and these types of compounds.

So the compound is either a propenyl or butenyl acetate, and whether it's cis or trans. Acetates are esters, right? So the structure would have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: there's a peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz). That's a pretty downfield shift, probably from an aromatic proton. Wait, but wait, acetates don't have aromatic rings. Oh, wait, maybe it's not an aromatic proton. Oh, wait, propenyl and butenyl groups have double bonds, so maybe that's a vinylic proton.

In the case of propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc or CH2CH2CH2... wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl would have a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Hmm, wait, no: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CR2, but more accurately, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but no, wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3 for propenyl acetate, but wait, actually, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2? No, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-, but the position of the double bond matters.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group. Alternatively, it could be CH3CH=CH-OAc, but that would be allyl acetate, I think. Wait, no, allyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

Wait, the double bond position in the substituent would affect the NMR. In propenyl acetate, the substituent is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

But wait, the NMR has a peak at 7.0 ppm as a doublet with J=16 Hz. Vinylic protons typically resonate between 4.5-7.0 ppm. So that's a good fit. Also, the coupling constant J=16 Hz is indicative of a
