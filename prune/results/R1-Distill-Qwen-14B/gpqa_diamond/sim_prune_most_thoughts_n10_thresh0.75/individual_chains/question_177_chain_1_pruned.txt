Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. But that's probably not directly relevant here, unless it factors into something else like temperature or brightness.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the peak wavelength. Oh right, that's from Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, that means both stars have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Interesting.

They also measured the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how that affects the luminosity calculation. Oh, wait—luminosity is intrinsic brightness, not apparent brightness. So maybe the radial velocity is a red herring here, unless it's affecting the observed wavelength via Doppler shift. But wait, if the peak wavelengths are the same, it might have already been accounted for. Or perhaps the velocities are related to the Doppler shift, which could affect the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is accounted for, leading us to use the same temperature. Hmmm.

So, the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are all around 2.2 or so. So I need to find the ratio L1/L2.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So since both radiate as black bodies, I can use this formula.

Given:
R1 = 1.5 R2
T1 = T2 (since their peak wavelengths are same)
So, L1/L2 = (4πR1²σT1⁴) / (4πR2²σT2⁴) ) = (R1/R2)² (T1/T2)^4

Plugging in the values:
(R1/R2) = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25
T1/T2 = 1 → (1)^4 = 1

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So A is 2.25. But wait, am I missing something?

Wait, what about the velocities? The problem mentions radial velocities; Star_1 has 0, Star_2 700 km/s. How does that affect anything?

Wait, if the stars' velocities are causing a Doppler shift, that would affect the observed wavelength, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift has been accounted for, meaning that the actual temperatures are the same when we correct for velocity.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the Doppler effect on the star's velocity. Let's think about it.

Doppler shift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But since we're looking at the peak wavelengths, which are the same for both stars, maybe we need to see what their actual temperatures are.

Wait a minute, if we observe the same peak wavelength for both stars, but one is moving towards us (negative velocity) or away (positive), that could affect the measured temperature. But in the problem, Star_1 has 0 velocity, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Let's think: if Star_2 is moving away, we see a redshift, which would make the observed wavelength longer. But their observed peak wavelengths are same. So to have the same observed wavelength, their actual temperatures must be different. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its emission would be redder, so its actual peak would be shorter (higher temperature) to appear the same as Star_1's peak.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. The observed wavelength λ_obs would be λ_rest * (1 + v/c). If Star 2's actual peak wavelength is λ2, then λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). Similarly, Star 1's observed wavelength is λ1 * (1 + v1/c). But v1 is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ1.

The problem states λ
