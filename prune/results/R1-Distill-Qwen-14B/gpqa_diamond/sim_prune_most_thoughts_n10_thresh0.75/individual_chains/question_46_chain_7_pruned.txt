Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what it's about. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers 4,8,6,2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is usually for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe cross metathesis. Wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is the starting material. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me count. Pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the formula would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the substituents on C3 are a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons? Oh no, wait, pent means five. Wait, let me think again. The main chain is five carbons, with the double bond at position 1 (between C1 and C2). So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that adds up to 5 carbons. Oh wait, no, that's five carbons in the chain. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count again. The formula for pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-
