Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember that this has something to do with the Saha equation, which deals with ionization and excitation in stellar atmospheres. 

So, the star's parameters are given. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, the spots are cooler, right? Because when spots are present, the average Teff decreases. But I'm not sure how that affects the photosphere's conditions.

The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. Let's denote this ratio as n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when it has spots. So the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes—n1/n2 (no spots) divided by n1/n2 (spots). So, the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n_i/n_j is equal to (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, E is the energy difference between the two levels, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. So, the energy difference ΔE is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So, ΔE = hc / λ. Let me compute that. But wait, maybe I don't need the actual value; perhaps I can express the exponent in terms of temperature.

Alternatively, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(kT), assuming E2 > E1, so the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, the ratio n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the ratio is lower, because the exponent is negative.

Wait, but in our case, when the temperature changes, how does the ratio change? Let's think: when the temperature is lower (when spots are present), how does the ratio n1/n2 change?

If T decreases, then the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases because the denominator is smaller. So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive, and if T decreases, the exponent's value increases. So exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive (E2 > E1). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement: when spots are present, the ratio decreases.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. So when the star has spots, T is lower, ratio is lower.

So, the factor is the ratio when no spots (T1=6000 K) divided by the ratio when spots (T2=5500 K). So factor = [n1/n2(T1)] / [n1/n2(T2)].

Since n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), the factor becomes [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / (g1/g2)] ] divided by [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) / (g1/g2) ].

Wait, no. Because the ratio n
