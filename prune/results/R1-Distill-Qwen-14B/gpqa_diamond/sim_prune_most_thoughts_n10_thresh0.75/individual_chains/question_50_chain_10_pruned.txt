Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think. I remember that loop diagrams in Feynman diagrams contribute to higher-order terms in perturbation theory. Each loop usually adds a certain factor to the amplitude, and the power of the coupling constants can indicate the number of vertices, which relate to loops.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let's break this down.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε₀ħc), so it's a dimensionless coupling constant. The presence of alpha^3 suggests that there are three vertices of the electromagnetic interaction. Then there's g squared, so that might be another interaction, maybe a strong force or another gauge interaction, implying two more vertices. 

Wait, but how does the number of vertices relate to the number of loops? Each loop typically adds a certain number of propagators or vertices. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the formula for the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is given by L = (V - I + 1)/2, where V is the number of vertices, I is the number of internal lines (propagators), but I'm not sure that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, I remember that the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated using the formula D = 4 - L, where L is the number of loops. But I'm not sure how that applies directly here. Another approach is considering the scaling with energy. The term (Q/M)^2 suggests a ratio of some energy scale Q over another M. But I'm not sure how that relates to the number of loops.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general form of loop integrals. Each loop integral typically introduces a factor of 1/(16π²) per loop for a four-dimensional integral. But here, the denominator is (4π)^6. So 4π is (16π²)^(1/2). Wait, (4π)^6 is (4π)^{2*3} = (16π²)^3. So the denominator is (16π²)^3. Each loop contributes a 1/(16π²), so three loops would give (1/(16π²))^
