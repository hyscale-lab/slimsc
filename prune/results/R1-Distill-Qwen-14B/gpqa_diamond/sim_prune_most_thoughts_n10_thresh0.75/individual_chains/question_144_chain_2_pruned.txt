Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is related to how long they live before decaying. 

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters. 

I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width Γ. The formula I remember is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, how does that tie into the distance? Oh right, because the mean decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime, L = v * τ. 

But wait, I need to make sure I'm using the right units. Let me jot down the constants. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, wait, no, that's ħ in units of GeV·s? Or perhaps I should think in terms of natural units first. Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm (femtometers) or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = cτ, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, in particle physics, sometimes they use units where c is 1, so the distance would be in energy units, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the unit conversions here.

Wait, let's break this down. First, calculate the lifetime τ using Γ. Then, find the velocity v of the meson, and then multiply τ by v to get the decay length. 

So, the decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to convert units here because Γ is in MeV and τ should be in seconds.

First,
