Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a small peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. And they ruled out spin-spin coupling. Oh, wait, because the coupling pattern doesn't suggest that. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

I remember that sometimes in NMR, if there are diastereotopic protons, they can split into multiple peaks. Diastereotopic protons are in different environments because of the molecule's stereochemistry, so they might split into two. But wait, the integral together is 1H, so maybe each is integrating to 0.5H each. Hmm. Or maybe it's something else.

Looking at the options. Option C is 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm a bit hazy on that. Double coupling usually refers to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but it's more about splitting. Like if a proton is next to two different J values, you might see more splitting. But in this case, the peaks are for the same alpha-proton, so maybe not. Plus, the problem says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as a cause, so that's not it.

Option D is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, if the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, then you could have two sets of protons. But would that lead to two peaks in the NMR? Because each diastereomer would have its own set of protons, but if the mixture is in equilibrium, maybe the peaks would merge. Or perhaps in this case, the two diastereomers are in such a way that each has the same alpha-proton environment, leading to two separate peaks. Not sure.

Option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha-protons would be identical because they're mirror images. So you'd only see one peak, right? Because their environments are the same. So that might not explain the two peaks. Unless there's some other factor, but I'm not recalling that. Wait, but if the molecule has some symmetry, maybe the enantiomers can cause some splitting, but I don't think so. Enantiomers usually don't split each other's signals in NMR unless there's something else going on.

Option A is contamination with a precursor. So if the compound isn't pure, maybe there's some precursor from the synthesis. But then, the LC-MS would show two peaks with the same mass? Wait, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight. But if it's a precursor, the precursor would have a different mass. Like, the expected mass is the target, but the precursor would be the previous stage. So if the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, that's the same molecule. So contamination with a different mass would show a different peak. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Wait, the question says the LC-MS has two peaks with same mass, same as expected. So it's not a different mass. So the peaks are for the same molecule. So the problem isn't with impurities but with something else about the same molecule.

Back to the NMR: two peaks for same alpha proton. The integral sums to 1H, so each is about 0.5H. So maybe the molecule has two different environments for that alpha proton. How could that happen? If the molecule is a diastereomer, perhaps. Let's say the compound has stereocenters elsewhere, so the alpha proton is in two different environments in the two diastereomers. So when you have a mixture of diastereomers, each contributes a peak for the alpha proton, but since they are different, the shifts are similar but not identical. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks for that proton.

But wait, if diastereomers are present, would the other signals also split into two? Or is the only signal that splits the alpha-proton? Because the question says only that two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the rest of the molecule's protons are not split because their environments are the same in both diastereomers. But that seems possible.

So the NMR shows two peaks for one proton, and the same mass in LC-MS with two peaks. So what's the same mass? Because if it's diastereomers, their masses would be the same, because same molecular formula. So in the LC-MS, you'd see two peaks of same mass but different retention times? Or same retention times? No, diastereomers have different physical properties, so different retention times. So if the LC shows two peaks, same mass, same retention time? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the question says "elevated temperature"â€”maybe the retention times are similar, but the question doesn't specify that. Hmm.

Wait, the question states that in the LC-MS, two peaks of equal intensity are present, same mass. So the same molecule, but in two different forms. So maybe the molecule is a tautomer? Or a conformer? Or a racemic mixture?

Wait, but racemic mixtures wouldn't split the NMR signals. Unless, perhaps, in the presence of a chiral shift reagent. But the question doesn't mention any such thing. So racemic mixture (enantiomers) would not cause the same alpha-proton to split into two in NMR. So that's probably not
