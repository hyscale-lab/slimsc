Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're asked to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states, respectively. And σx is a bit trickier because its eigenstates are the same up and down states but in a different basis.

I think the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

The operator here is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so I can split it up like that.

First, I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately for the given state.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me double-check the normalization. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. 0.25 +0.75 is 1, so it's normalized. Good.

So for σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times the eigenvalues. For σz, |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1, |↓⟩ eigenvalue -1.

So ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * 1 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: 0.25 *1 = 0.25, and (3/4) * (-1) = -0.75. So 0.25 -0.75 is -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Then, the first term is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit different because its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, I think they're the states |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when we apply σx to |↑⟩, which is [1,0]^T, we get [0,1]^T which is |↓⟩. Similarly, σx on |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

But to find ⟨σx⟩, it's ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way without getting into matrix multiplication. Let me think about how to compute this expectation value.

An alternative approach: the expectation value of σx is equal to the difference between the probabilities of measuring +1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe better to write out the state and compute the expectation value directly.

So, let me write the state ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is the matrix:
[ [0,1],
  [1,0] ]

So σx |ψ⟩ is [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is ψ† (σx ψ) 

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )

Wait, because ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So the dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = ( sqrt(3)/4 ) + ( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Hmm, but wait, that's the expectation value of σx. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but I can check this another way because I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in a state (a|
