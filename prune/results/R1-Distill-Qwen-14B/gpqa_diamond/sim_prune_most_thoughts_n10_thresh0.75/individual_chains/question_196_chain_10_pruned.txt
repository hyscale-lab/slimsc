Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. Also, we're considering relativistic effects, so the speed of light c must come into play.

Wait, I remember that in the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs at the equilibrium position, right? Because that's where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the maximum speed v_max_classical would be sqrt(kA²/m). But this is the relativistic case, so the answer can't be option C, because that's the non-relativistic formula.

But wait, the options have c in them, so we're definitely in a relativistic scenario. So I need to consider how relativity affects the equations here.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is given by the total relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the classical case, at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. But in relativity, I'm not sure if that's exactly the same. Or maybe the oscillator's equation of motion changes due to relativistic effects.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to use the relativistic form of the harmonic oscillator equation. Oh, right, in the relativistic scenario, the equation of motion might be modified. I think the force law would still be F = -kx, but the expression for momentum would be relativistic.

Wait, the force F is the derivative of momentum with respect to time. In relativity, momentum p is gamma*m*v. So F = d(p)/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt. But for a harmonic oscillator, F = -kx, so we have:

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Hmm, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of
