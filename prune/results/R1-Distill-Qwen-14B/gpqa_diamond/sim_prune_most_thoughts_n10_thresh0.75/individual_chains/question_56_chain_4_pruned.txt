Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom's energy levels and transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum, right?

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are something like Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, because the dipole operator is a vector, so it affects the angular momentum. So for each transition, these rules must be followed.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. Since l can only change by ±1, the first transition from l=0 must go to l=1. So the first step would be from |3,0,0> to either |n',1,m'> where n' is 2 or 4? But wait, considering energy levels, n decreases when the atom emits a photon. So from n=3, the next lower n would be n=2. So the first transition would be to a state with n=2, l=1.

What about the m value? For the initial state, m=0. So the possible m's after the first transition can be m= -1, 0, +1 because Δm can be 0, ±1. So the first transition could go to |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,-1>.

But then, from that state, the second transition must take it to |1,0,0>. Let's think. The current state after first transition is l=1. So the next transition must change l to 0, because the final state is l=0. So Δl = -1 (since 1→0).

So the second transition must be from l=1 to l=0. That means m could change by 0, ±1. Let's see what the final m is. The final state is m=0. So for the second transition, if the state after the first transition is |2,1, m>, then the next m must be 0. So from m in the first transition, the change must be such that m + Δm = 0.

Wait, let's break it down. Suppose the first transition goes to |2,1, m1>, then the second transition must go to |1,0,0>. So in the second transition, Δm must be such that m1 + Δm = 0. And Δm can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible m1 values would be 0, 1, or -1. Because:

If m1 is 0: then Δm would be 0 (since 0 + 0 =0).

If m1 is 1: then Δm = -1 (1 -1 =0).

If m1 is -1: then Δm = +1 (-1 +1=0).

So any of the m states in the first transition could potentially allow a transition to m=0 in the second step. So the initial state could transition to any of |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,-1> in the first step, and then each of these would need to transition to |1,0,0>.

But wait, what about the possible transitions? Each transition must follow the selection rules. So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, which is allowed. The second transition is from l=1 to l=0, which is also allowed.

Now, the question is about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at them.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option D: (I think maybe the option is missing something? The option D says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 2/3.)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Looking back: the options are:

A) ... and 1/3

B) ... and 1/4

C) ... and 1/4

D) ... and 2/3

Wait, each option gives two steps and a probability. So which one is the correct route and what is the probability?

So the possible paths are:

Path 1:
