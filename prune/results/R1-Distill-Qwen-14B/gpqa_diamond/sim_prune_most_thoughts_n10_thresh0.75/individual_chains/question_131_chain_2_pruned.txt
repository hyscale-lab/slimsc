Alright, let's try to solve this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions involving dicarboxylic acids, their dehydration to anhydrides, and subsequent reactions with a diene. Then, the NMR data is analyzed to determine which resonances are connected by a cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum.

First, let's start by understanding the initial steps.

The problem says a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, right? And since the starting material is cis, the resulting anhydride might have some sort of ring structure. 

Looking at the NMR data of the anhydride: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where carbonyl protons or aromatic protons appear. But wait, anhydrides usually have two carbonyl groups. Hmm. Wait, if the H NMR has a single peak, maybe it's a symmetrical structure. So, perhaps the anhydride is cyclic and symmetrical. Let me think: cis-dicarboxylic acid dehydrating would form a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid, dehydration would form a five-membered cyclic anhydride, like succinic anhydride maybe? No, wait, succinic is from a trans-diol. Oh wait, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's maleic anhydride, but maleic comes from a trans-dicarboxylic acid, I think. Wait, no, maleic acid is cis, and when dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a bicyclic structure. Wait, but wait, I think maleic anhydride is actually a cyclic structure with a double bond. Oh, but in 13C NMR, it has two peaks for the carbonyl carbons. Wait, the 13C spectrum has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. So 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like a carbonyl, but 165 is definitely a carbonyl. Wait, in anhydrides, two carbonyl carbons. So maybe one is a double bond carbonyl and another is an oxygen connected one.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows 137 and 165. 165 is likely a carbonyl (maybe an ester or anhydride), while 137 could be an spÂ² carbon adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps part of a double bond.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. If the anhydride structure is symmetrical, the protons would be equivalent. So a single peak at 7 ppm suggests that all equivalent protons are in the same environment. Maybe it's a cyclic anhydride where the two carbonyls are symmetrical. For example, a bicyclic structure where
