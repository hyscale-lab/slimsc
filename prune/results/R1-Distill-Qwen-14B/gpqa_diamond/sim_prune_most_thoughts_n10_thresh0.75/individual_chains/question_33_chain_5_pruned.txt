Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are all about how different molecules combine to form rings. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I'm supposed to find the exo product from the options given.

Wait, [4+2] cycloaddition... Oh right, that's a Diels-Alder reaction! The Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring. So one of the molecules must be the diene, and the other the dienophile.

Let me look at the structures. 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups on the 2 and 5 positions. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. So it's like a conjugated diene? Wait, no, thiophene is aromatic, so maybe it's acting as the diene here. Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, furan-2,5-dione. Furan is a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms, and here it's 2,5-dione, which probably means there are two ketone groups. So the structure would be a furan with two ketones on adjacent carbons â€” wait, no, positions 2 and 5 would be across the ring, so that would be the 2 and 5 positions. So the furan-2,5-dione is like having two ketones opposite each other.

Wait, furan is O=C-O-C-O-C=O? No, wait. Furan is O-C-O in a five-membered ring. So if it's 2,5-dione, that would be positions 2 and 5 in the furan ring as ketones. So the structure would be O=C-O-C-O-C=O? No, that can't be right because furan is a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. So the numbering is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So positions 2 and 5 are across from each other. So the structure would have two ketones at positions 2 and 5 of the furan ring. So it's a dienophile, maybe.

So
