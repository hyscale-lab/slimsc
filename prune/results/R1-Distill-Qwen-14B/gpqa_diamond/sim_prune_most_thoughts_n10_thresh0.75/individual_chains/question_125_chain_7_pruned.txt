Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that a harmonic oscillator potential is like a spring, so the force is Hooke's law, F = -kr, but here k would be m ω².

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but wait no, actually for a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial quantum number. Hmm.

Wait, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the principal quantum number. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Each direction (x, y, z) has a quantum number like n_x, n_y, n_z. And the total energy would be E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh wait, because in each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, sometimes it's more convenient to define n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy can be written as E = ħω (n + 3/2). So n is the total number of quanta in all three directions.

So, the ground state is when n=0, because n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. The first excited state would be when n=1. Then the third excited state
