Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through each clue carefully. Let's see what the data says.

The question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A to D, corresponding to these formulas.

Starting with the FTIR: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, where exactly? A broad peak around 3000 could be from an alcohol (like -OH) or maybe a carbonyl group, but no, the carbonyls are at higher wavenumbers. Oh, but looking further, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Those look like carbonyl (C=O) stretches. 1700 is probably a ketone or aldehyde, while 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or something with conjugation, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: if there's a peak at 1650, that might suggest a carbonyl with conjugation, like an ester or a conjugated ketone. Because esters have C=O around 1730-1750 usually, but maybe if conjugated, it could be lower. Or maybe it's an amide, but no, the possible formulas don't include nitrogen. Hmm.

So the FTIR suggests there are O-H groups (from the broad peak) and at least two carbonyl groups (two strong peaks). Wait, two carbonyl peaks? That's a bit unusual. Maybe one is a carbonyl from an ester or ketone and the other is from something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated system where the conjugation lowers the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C (olefinic) stretch, but that's usually lower than 1650. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl and another group.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is not a carbonyl. What else could that be? An aromatic ring might have C=C stretching around 1600. But 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, which would lower the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is from an amide, but again, the formula doesn't indicate any N.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak, which could explain it. But wait, the other peaks: 1700 and 1650. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, maybe the 1700 is the C=O of the acid, and the 1650 is something else. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the C=O is around 1700-1750, and maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated system or another carbonyl.

Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 are both strong. So maybe two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's move to the next clue: the 1H NMR. It shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene.
