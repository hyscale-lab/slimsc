Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions, and we're supposed to figure out the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product. Hmm, where do I start?

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The product is a light yellow solid, and the data includes an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and an H NMR spectrum with specific peaks. Oh right, IR absorption around 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But since KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile, maybe it's an elimination reaction or a substitution.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Ad is adamantane, which has a diamondoid structure, so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe they're on opposite faces? Hmm, but with KOH, especially in a high temperature, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but I have two bromines; perhaps it's a double elimination. Let's think, KOH could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, maybe the product is 1,3-diene? Or maybe a single elimination, but with two bromines, perhaps two eliminations occur.

Wait, the product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. Wait, but elimination would give an alkene, right? Unless it's a substitution that leads to a carbonyl. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's an E2 elimination forming a double bond, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or other elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, KOH could cause a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps it's a double substitution.

Wait, another thought. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, might undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an adamantadiene, but that would produce an alkene. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is more in line with a ketone or ester. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters, which doesn't seem relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a coupling reaction. But in the presence of a strong base like KOH, more likely elimination. But if two eliminations occur, perhaps forming a conjugated diene. But then where's the carbonyl?

Oh wait, maybe the product isn't an elimination but an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups. But that would give diols, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps when two adjacent bromides are present, heating with KOH could lead to the formation of a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a double elimination leading to an alkene, but that doesn't give a
