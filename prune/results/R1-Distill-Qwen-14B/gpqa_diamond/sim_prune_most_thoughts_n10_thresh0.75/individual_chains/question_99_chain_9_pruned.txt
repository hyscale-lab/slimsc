Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized with FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. There's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets.

The options given are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted pentanoic acid or similar. Let me list them out again to keep track:

Options:
A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse each structure.

Looking at each option:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, it's a chain where the central two carbons are each attached to a CH3, a CH2CH3 (C2H5), and two more CH2 groups leading to the COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH2CH3 (from the CH3CH2 group) and two C2H5 groups? Not sure, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. Wait, the structure is CH3CH2 attached to a C that's bonded to another C. Let me think. The formula for B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the two middle carbons each have a CH2CH3 group and another C2H5 group. Hmmm, perhaps they have two ethyl groups each?

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the central carbons has a CH3 and another CH3 (so maybe two methyl groups each?), and then a CH2 leading to COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So each of the middle carbons has a CH2CH3 group and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the central part of the molecule is a geminal di-substituted carbon. Oh wait, actually, looking at each structure, it's more like each of the two middle carbons is substituted with two different groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a gem-dimethyl or gem-diethyl, but in this case, the substituents vary.

But let's start by interpreting the spectroscopic data.

The FTIR has a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The broad peak at ~3000 is likely an O-H stretch, which in carboxylic acids is usually very broad because of hydrogen bonding. So this suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.

So all the options are carboxylic acids, which makes sense because they all end with COOH.

Next, let's look at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so that rules out any double bonds, but looking at the options, they don't have any double bonds. So that's fine.

In the NMR, there are multiple signals. Two of them are:

1. A doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. A doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, that's a bit complex splitting. Let me think about what that implies. Splitting in NMR comes from neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons will split the signal into a certain pattern. The splitting is multiplicative based on neighboring groups.

A doublet of triplets of quartets suggests that a proton is next to three sets of neighboring groups: the first (maybe a triplet) splits into a quartet, then that splits into a triplet from another set, and so on. Or perhaps more accurately, each split is a result of coupling with different sets of protons.

Alternatively, maybe each splitting is due to different adjacent groups. For example, a proton might be next to another set of protons that have different coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for structures where a particular proton is split by multiple adjacent protons. Let's consider each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Let me draw the structure.

The structure would be: COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let's write it properly.

The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, it's CH3CH2 attached to a C which is attached to another C which has a CH3
