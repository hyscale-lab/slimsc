Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let's parse the information given step by step.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, that suggests that X might be an element with a common isotope and a heavier, less stable one. For example, maybe something like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, the same number of neutrons and protons? So that would mean the molecule is made of elements where each atom has equal n and p. Let me think: The most common gas like that is probably CO2? No, wait, wait. Let's check. For gas W, each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider possible gases.

Wait, another possibility: If W is H2O, but that's a liquid. Maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's CO2? Let me think: Carbon has 6 protons. Oxygen has 8. Each CO2 molecule has one C and two O atoms. So the molecule's composition: For each CO2, C has 6 p and 8-6=2 n? Wait, wait, no. Wait, each atom has protons equal to atomic number, and neutrons can vary. But wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, that's an important point. So sum of protons in the molecule equals sum of neutrons. Let's think of simple molecules. H2O: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 (if it's H1), O has 8. So total neutrons: 0 + 8 = 8. Not equal. So not H2O.

What about CO2? C has
