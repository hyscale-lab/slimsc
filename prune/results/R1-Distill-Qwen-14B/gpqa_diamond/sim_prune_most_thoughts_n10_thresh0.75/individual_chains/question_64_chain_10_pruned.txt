Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and there are some weight changes and a gas C left. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when salts are heated, especially without air, they might decompose. The tubes they pass through probably react with certain gases. Let's think about each tube.

The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I think Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent but can also react with certain gases. Oh wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water, but in this case, the gas must be something else. Wait, maybe it's absorbing H+ ions? Or perhaps it's reacting with some acid gas.

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide is a strong base, so it probably reacts with acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. But the weight of this tube didn't change. That suggests that the gas passing through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. So maybe the gas wasn't an acid, or it didn't have any acidic component after the first tube.

The third tube is red-hot copper. When gases pass through hot copper, they might react. For example, CO2 can react with copper to form CuO and CO. Or maybe sulfur dioxide could do something. Wait, copper is a catalyst in some reactions. Alternatively, the gas might be reacting with oxygen, but since it's heated without air, maybe the initial setup didn't have O2. Hmm, but the problem says that CuO formed in tube 3. So the gas must have had some oxygen, or perhaps it was a reducing agent.

Wait, the initial setup was heated without air, so maybe the salts decomposed in an inert atmosphere, but the gases then were passed through these tubes, which are probably in an open system.

Let me think about the reactions in each tube.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. If the gas is moisture, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. But the weight increased by 3.60 grams. Wait, but if the gas is something else, maybe Mg(ClO4)2 can react with certain gases. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is HCl? Because Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with HCl gas.

Wait, let's think what Mg(ClO4)2 can do. It can react with HCl to produce MgCl2, HClO4, and H2O. The reaction would look like:

Mg(ClO4)2 + 4 HCl → MgCl2 + 4 HClO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and reacts with H2O, but HCl is a gas. Alternatively,
