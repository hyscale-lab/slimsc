Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one at a time.

First, part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an OCH2 group attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl chain. Wait, let me draw that. The substituent would be OCH2 connected to CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me number the butene. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2-). Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 2. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-. Because the substituent is but-2-en-1-yl: the substituent is the 1-yl position, so the chain starts with the first carbon attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is the substituent. Let me break it down. The butenyl group is four carbons long. The double bond is between C2 and C3 (since it's but-2-en). The substituent is 3-methyl, so on C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is CH2
