Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is this diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So, when heated with excess KOH, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe dehydrohalogenation? That would form an alkene.

The product is a light yellow solid, and the ¹H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -OH group or maybe an ether. Wait, the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, wait, but 1720 is more like an ester or ketone. Or maybe a carbonyl from an elimination product?

Wait, when dibromides react with strong bases, like KOH, they can eliminate to form alkenes. But wait, in the presence of KOH and heat, maybe it's more of an E2 mechanism. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. So product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C3, making it 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps it's more likely to form a conjugated diene. Wait, but the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction isn't elimination. What if it's a substitution? But with two bromines, that would be unlikely. Another thought: perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Or maybe it's a Grignard reaction, but no, that's done with Mg, not KOH.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Because KOH can cause eliminations. Oh, right, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a strong base, they undergo de
