Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis, right? So metathesis is when you rearrange the alkene bonds, swapping the ends. Let me think about what the structure of the starting material is.

3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. So the chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No wait, wait. Wait, 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw it out.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because then the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the methyl is on carbon 3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl to the third carbon would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Yeah, that's correct. So the molecule is symmetric? Well, no, because the substituents around the double bond are different. Let me check: on one side of the double bond, we have CH2- and on the other, CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Hmm, not symmetric.

Wait, but the problem says it's racemic, which implies that the starting material is a racemic mixture. Wait, but wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene—is that molecule chiral? Let me see. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the substituents on C2 and C3 would be CH2CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me look at the structure again.

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons. Carbon 1: CH2=, Carbon 2: CH-, then Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-, etc. So Carbon 2 is attached to Carbon 1 (double bond) and Carbon 3. Carbon 3 is attached to a methyl group and two other carbons.

Wait, but the molecule's geometry—if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the substituents on the double bond are on C2 and C3. So the groups on the double bond are CH2 (from C1) and CH(CH3) (from C3). Wait, but wait: C2 is connected to C3, so perhaps the substituents are (on each end of the double bond):

On the left of the double bond (C1): CH2-.

On the right (C2): connected to CH(CH3) and another CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C2 is attached to C1 (CH2), and to C3 (CH(CH3)CH2CH3).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecule in terms of possible stereoisomerism. Wait, but if the molecule is racemic, that implies that it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, for a molecule to have enantiomers, it must have a chiral center. Does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center?

Looking at the structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Carbon 2 is bonded to C1 (double bond), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, carbon 1: CH2=.

Carbon 2: CH-.

Wait, but wait, how many substituents does carbon 2 have? It's double bonded to carbon 1, so that counts as one substituent. Then, it's attached to carbon 3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two hydrogens? So the substituents on C2 are: one H, one H, one CH(CH3)CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. Wait, no, the double bond takes up two substituents. So carbon 2 has:

- Double bond to C1 (so two substituents),

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up valency. Carbon has four bonds. So, for carbon 2 in this structure:

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which would imply that the double bond is between C1 and C2, C2 is connected to C3, which has a methyl group and another CH2CH3.

Wait, but in any case, does any carbon in this molecule have four different substituents, making it a chiral center? Let's look.

Carbon 2: substituents are:

- CH2 group (from C1),

- a double bond (so maybe that's considered a substituent? Or no, because it's a double bond, perhaps it's part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

But no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So Carbon 2 has:

- Double bond (so two substituents),

- CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (from the next carbon),

- and two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's not possible because Carbon can't have four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So for Carbon 2, which is the CH in CH2=CH, the substituents are:

- C1: CH2 (from CH2=),

- C3: CH(CH3) (since it's connected to C3, which is CH(CH3)),

- and two hydrogens.

So for Carbon 2, substituents are: CH2 (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two Hs.

Wait, that makes four substituents? No, because the double bond takes up two bonds, so substituents are:

- One substituent is the CH2 group (from C1),

- Another substituent is the CH(CH3) group (from C3),

- And two more substituents are H.

Wait, but wait: when you have a double bond, each carbon involved has two substituents from the double bond. So, Carbon 2 is connected by double bond to C1 (so two substituents there?), but that doesn't count as substituents in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents for determining chirality are the groups attached via single bonds.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that in this molecule, there's no chiral center because no carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says the starting material is a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. So if it's racemic, it's a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. Therefore, this implies that the molecule has a chiral center. So I must have made a mistake in determining the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (R) and (S) configurations at a certain carbon. So where is the chiral center?

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Now, let's look at the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH2= (double bond to C2)

Carbon 2: CH- (attached to C1, C3, and two Hs?)

Carbon 3: CH(CH3) (attached to C2, C4, and a CH3)

Carbon 4: CH2 (attached to C3 and C5)

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, but where is the chiral center? Carbon 3 is attached to CH(CH3), so what's attached to it?

Wait, Carbon 3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH-),

- C4 (CH2-),

- a CH3 group,

- and a H?

Wait, no. Let me count the substituents on C3.

C3 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to:

- C2,

- C4,

- a methyl group (CH3),

- and another substituent. Wait, wait, no: the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is C5H10.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is pent-1-ene with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, C3 is attached to four groups: C2 (CH from the double bond), C4 (CH2), a CH3 group, and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Let me see: the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So for C3:

- One bond to C2 (which is CH-),

- One bond to C4 (CH2-),

- One bond to a CH3,

- And one more bond: is that a H?

Wait, but in the structure, that's not possible because that would make four substituents: CH2=CH-, CH(CH3), CH2CH3, and a H?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So C3 is CH(CH3), so four bonds: C2 (CH-), C4 (CH2-), a methyl group (CH3), and a hydrogen.

Wait, because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: the two from the chain and the methyl. So, in that case, C3 has four different substituents: CH2=CH-, CH2CH2CH3 (wait, no, wait).

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C3 are:

- One CH2=CH-

- One CH2CH3 (from CH(CH3)CH2CH3?), no, I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to draw this out. But since I can't, let me try to think step by step.

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Looking at C3:

- It's connected to C2 (which is CH- from CH2=CH-),

- Connected to C4 (CH2-),

- Has a CH3 group,

- And a hydrogen.

So the four substituents are: CH2=CH- (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4?), CH3, and H.

Wait, but that can't be. Because C4 is CH2- connected to C5 (CH3). So, C3 is connected to C4 (which is CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, C4 is CH2-CH3 because the chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it as:

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the substituents on C3 are:

- C2: CH2=CH- (so a CH2 group attached via a double bond),

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the groups attached to C3 as:

- One CH2=CH- group (from C2),

- One CH2CH3 group (from C4, which is connected to C3 and then C5),

- A CH3 group,

- And a hydrogen.

So four different groups: CH2=CH-, CH2CH3, CH3, and H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center, which means it can exist as enantiomers. Hence, the racemic mixture is a 50:50 mix of (R) and (S) configurations at C3.

Now, the problem is that we're treating this racemic mixture with Grubbs catalyst. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. In this case, the double bond in 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Grubbs catalyst typically causes ring-closing metathesis if possible, or cross metathesis if there are other alkenes. But in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is an isolated alkene—so probably undergoing ring-closing metathesis if possible, but wait, the molecule is a straight chain, so perhaps it can't form a ring, so maybe it undergoes exchange metathesis, swapping ends.

Wait, but Grubbs can also cause ring-opening metathesis, but in this case, the starting material is a single alkene, so perhaps it's more about breaking and reforming.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-closing metathesis. But for that, you need a diene or a di-alkene. Since the starting material is a mono-alkene, that's not possible. So perhaps it's a cross metathesis, but without another alkene, that's not feasible either. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility is that Grubbs catalyst might cause the alkene to undergo a ring-opening metathesis, but that requires a cyclic alkene, which this isn't. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple olefin metathesis—Grubbs breaks the double bond and reconnects the ends. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In metathesis, Grubbs would break the double bond and swap the ends. So, the reaction would produce two different alkenes: the original ends are CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Metathesis would exchange these.

Wait, but wait: when Grubbs catalyst is used for metathesis, it can cause the exchange of the substituents across the double bond. So, for each molecule, the ends can swap.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. When Grubbs acts, it can break the double bond and form new alkenes by swapping the substituents.

So, for each molecule, the two ends (the CH2 group and the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group) can exchange places. So, the possible products would be the same molecule (if no exchange) or the transposed version, but wait, that's because Grubbs can cause either end to become the other.

Wait, but wait: the original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the substituents on the double bond are CH2CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, no, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis would break the double bond and form new bonds between the ends. So, the reaction would produce a mixture of products. Let me think about what would happen.

In the case of CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, during metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond, and exchange the substituents. So, the two ends (CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3) can swap. So, the products would be ethylene (the small molecule) and the other product from the rearrangement.

Wait, but wait, ethylene would be a byproduct? Because the metathesis typically involves the exchange of substituents. So, breaking the double bond and forming new bonds would produce a larger molecule and ethylene.

So in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Breaking that and swapping would give us ethylene (from the two CH2 groups?), but perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, the metathesis could produce ethylene and a different alkene.

Wait, perhaps the products are ethylene and 3-methylpent-1-ene. But that doesn't seem right because that would be the same as the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a different alkene, such as 3-methylcyclopentene, but that would require a ring closure, which I'm not sure is feasible here.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism of Grubbs catalyst. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst (usually Ru) that facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes come together to form a ring, but in ring-opening, a cyclic alkene is broken open.

But in this case, the starting material is a single alkene. So perhaps it's a case of olefin metathesis where the double bond is broken and reconnected in a different way. Wait, but for that, you need another double bond, which you don't have here.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo self-metathesis, but without a diene, perhaps it's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material undergoes a ring-closing metathesis if possible. But the molecule is a straight chain, so to form a ring, the double bond would have to connect to another part of the molecule. Let's see: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the double bond were to form a ring, perhaps between C1 and C3, but that's not feasible because the double bond is already between C1 and C2. Alternatively, maybe between C2 and C5, but that would require a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps metathesis isn't possible here, but I'm probably wrong because Grubbs is a powerful catalyst.

Wait, perhaps when Grubbs acts on an alkene, it breaks the double bond and can either form a smaller and a larger molecule. So in this case, if the double bond breaks, and the substituents are swapped, one product would be ethylene (CH2=CH2) and the other would be a larger molecule.

So, for CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, breaking the double bond and swapping would form ethylene and another molecule where the substituents are connected the other way.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The starting molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If Grubbs breaks the double bond, perhaps it can form two new alkenes. But without another alkene, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst causes the molecule to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, but that requires a diene or a structure that can form a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a cross metathesis with another molecule, but in this case, it's a monomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me look again.

Question: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, so perhaps the product isn't ethene but a different molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene, but no, the question says 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is a mono-ene.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

In olefin metathesis, the product can be a mixture of alkenes. In this case, perhaps the catalyst causes the double bond to shift position or form a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could produce a different alkene by breaking and reconnecting. For example, the double bond could shift from between C1 and C2 to between C2 and C3.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's how metathesis works. Grubbs typically breaks the double bond and reforms new ones by exchanging substituents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction would produce a different structure. Let me think: when the double bond in CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 is broken, perhaps the substituents on either end are swapped, leading to formation of a new double bond.

Wait, but in this molecule, the substituents on either end of the double bond are CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

If Grubbs causes metathesis, the substituents would swap, so the new double bond would be between the other end. But perhaps that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis would produce a new double bond between C3 and C4. So, the product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis would result in two different products, each with a different substituent arrangement.

But wait, the starting material is a racemic mixture, so each enantiomer would react the same way, perhaps producing the same products.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, not considering ethene. So perhaps ethene is a byproduct, and the main product is another alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring formation, but I can't see how that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the Grubbs catalyst causes the alkene to undergo a shift, leading to different possible alkenes.

Wait, perhaps another approach: how many different alkenes can be formed from 3-methylpent-1-ene via Grubbs metathesis.

Wait, Grubbs can cause the olefin to undergo a shift, perhaps leading to different possible positions of the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction could form cyclopentene derivatives, but without a cyclic structure, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a cyclic product via ring-closing metathesis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of similar examples. For example, if you have 1-pentene and treat it with Grubbs, would it undergo metathesis to form ethylene and another product?

Wait, perhaps in this case, the product would be ethylene and another molecule. But the question says to exclude ethene, so perhaps the main product is another alkene.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction doesn't produce another alkene but instead a different diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't possible, but that's unlikely because Grubbs is a versatile catalyst.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the racemic mixture will lead to different products based on the stereoisomerism of the starting material.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a racemic mixture, so each enantiomer would react in the same way because the reaction doesn't discriminate between R and S configurations.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction's outcome depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a racemic mixture of a single alkene (E or Z?), but wait, wait a minute: 3-methylpent-1-ene is a racemic mixture, so perhaps the double bond has some stereochemistry.

Wait, but wait: that's confusing. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene, as I thought earlier, is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Since the double bond is between C1 and C2, the substituents on each end are CH3 (from C1: CH2=) and CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (from C2: which is attached to the rest of the chain).

Wait, but that structure doesn't have any E or Z isomerism because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same from each side.

Wait, no: actually, looking again, for E and Z isomerism, each carbon in the double bond must have two different substituents. So on C1 (CH2=), the substituents are two H's and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. On C2 (CH-), the substituents are a H, a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, and a CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Carbon 1: CH2=, so substituents are H, H, and CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Carbon 2: CH- connected to CH2=, CH(CH3)CH2CH3, and two H's.

Wait, no: Carbon 1 is CH2=, so it's connected to two H's and a CH- (from C2). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the reaction.

Grubbs catalyst would cause the double bond to break and reform. So, the possible products would be determined by the possible ways the ends can be connected.

But without another alkene, perhaps the only possible product is ethylene and the same starting material, but since ethylene is excluded, the product is the same as the starting material, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says to find the number of possible products.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the structure of the starting material.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a racemic mixture, leading to different products when the reaction occurs. For example, each enantiomer could form a different product, but since the catalyst is the same, perhaps the products are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to different stereochemistry in the products.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options given. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

So, the possible number of products is either 2,4,6, or8.

If the starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers, and each enantiomer gives the same product upon metathesis, then the number of products would be determined by the possible products from each enantiomer.

But perhaps each enantiomer leads to a different product, thereby increasing the number of possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to different products based on the configuration of the starting material.

Another thought: perhaps the metathesis leads to different possible alkenes based on where the double bond forms. For example, the product could have the double bond in a different position, leading to different structures.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, so the possible positions of the double bond after metathesis would be between C2 and C3, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: when Grubbs breaks the double bond, it can form new alkenes by exchanging the substituents.

So, the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Breaking the double bond and exchanging substituents could form a new structure where the double bond is between C3 and C4, for example.

Wait, but how? Let me try.

If the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, Grubbs would break the double bond and form new bonds. The substituents on either end (CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3) could swap.

So, the new product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, that would require the substituents to swap, leading to CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the new structure would have a double bond elsewhere. For example, maybe the product is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, so no.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the possible products formed from metathesis.

In metathesis, the two ends of the double bond can either stay the same or swap. So, in this case, the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the ends swap, the new structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, the product would be 3-methylpent-2-ene.

Wait, but that's possible. So, the product would have a double bond between C2 and C3, making it 2-pentene. But wait, the starting material is 1-pentene, so the product would be 2-pentene.

So, the possible products are ethylene and 3-methylpent-2-ene. But the question says to exclude ethylene, so the main product would be 3-methylpent-2-ene.

But wait, is that the only product? Or are there more possibilities?

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can also form a cyclic product. For example, if the chain can form a ring by connecting C1 and C4, that would form cyclopentene. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material can undergo a ring-closing metathesis, but given the chain length, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce a different product and just breaks the double bond, but that would lead to alkanes, which aren't alkenes.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let's think about the number of possible products.

If the starting material is a racemic mixture, and upon metathesis, each enantiomer produces the same product, then the number of possible products is 1 (excluding ethylene). But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer produces a different product, leading to two products. So, the answer would be D) 2.

But wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is a racemic mixture, so each enantiomer would give the same product upon metathesis, so the number of products would be the same as if it were a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to different products based on the starting configuration, leading to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond, and that new double bond can have different stereochemistry, leading to E and Z isomers.

But in this case, the starting material is a racemic mixture, so perhaps the products would be a mix of E and Z for the new double bond.

But then, how many isomers would that produce?

Wait, if the new product is 3-methylpent-2-ene, then the double bond would be between C2 and C3. The substituents on each end would be:

On C2: CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

On C3: CH(CH3) and CH2CH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a mixture of E and Z for the new double bond.

If that's the case, then for each enantiomer of the starting material, the product could have E or Z configuration, leading to more products.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. When treated with Grubbs, the metathesis occurs, leading to the formation of ethylene and another product. But since the question says to exclude ethylene, the only product is the other alkene.

But how many possible alkenes can be formed? Let me think about possible structures.

The original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Metathesis could result in the following:

1. Breaking the double bond, and swapping the substituents to form a new double bond between C2 and C3. So, the product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So, CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't have a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that would require more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-methylcyclopentene. But I don't see how that would form without a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mixture of different alkenes, such as 3-methylpent-2-ene and another isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the molecule, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two new alkenes. For example, ethylene and the product from the metathesis. But since ethylene is excluded, only the other product counts.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct answer is 2 products, so D) 2.

But wait, I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the starting material is a racemic mixture, leading to four possible products (two from each enantiomer), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each enantiomer, the product is the same, so only two products in total.

Wait, but I'm stuck. I think the correct number of products is 2, so the answer is D) 2.


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, where the double bond is between C1 and C2. The molecule exists as a racemic mixture, meaning it is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers due to the chiral center at C3.

Grubbs catalyst promotes the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. In this case, the double bond in 3-methylpent-1-ene can undergo metathesis, leading to the exchange of substituents on either side of the double bond. This reaction produces ethylene (CH₂=CH₂) as a byproduct and a new alkene with the double bond repositioned. Since the question specifies excluding ethylene, the focus is on the other product.

The metathesis rearranges the substituents, resulting in **3-methylpent-2-ene** as the primary product. This product is formed by shifting the double bond from between C1 and C2 to between C2 and C3. The structure of 3-methylpent-2-ene is **CH₃-CH=CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, where the double bond is now between C2 and C3.

The racemic nature of the starting material does not lead to additional distinct products because the reaction does not depend on the stereochemistry of the starting enantiomers. Both enantiomers of the starting material yield the same product, 3-methylpent-2-ene. Therefore, the number of possible products, excluding ethylene, is **1**.

However, the problem's options suggest considering multiple products. If the reaction were to produce different stereoisomers (e.g., E and Z isomers) of the product, this could increase the number of possible products. For 3-methylpent-2-ene, the double bond between C2 and C3 could theoretically exist as E or Z isomers depending on the substituents. If both isomers are formed, the total number of products would be **2**.

Given the options provided and the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is that there are **2 possible products** (excluding ethylene).
