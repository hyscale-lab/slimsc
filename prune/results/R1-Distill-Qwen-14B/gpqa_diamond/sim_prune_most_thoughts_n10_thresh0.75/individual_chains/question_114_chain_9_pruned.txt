Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's that about. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually some kind of substitution. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced. But wait, I think it's more like a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, no, wait. In the presence of a good nucleophile like CN⁻, ketones can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN⁻ ions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination? Or maybe a substitution. Oh, wait, wait. I think the reaction here is the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl group is replaced by a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group.

So the reaction would be: ketone + CN⁻ → cyanohydrin. How does that happen? I think the mechanism involves the nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon. Then, the oxygen becomes an oxonium ion, which picks up a proton, and then perhaps another step? Or maybe it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait
