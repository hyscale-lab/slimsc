Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember Lyman alpha is a specific emission line in hydrogen, right? And since the hydrogen is neutral, it's probably the 21 cm line, but wait, no, the 21 cm line is a different thing. Oh wait, no, Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Right, so the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet range.

But the question is about detecting these clouds with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So how does that work? Oh wait, when the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength of the absorbed light gets shifted to longer wavelengths, which is called redshift. So if the redshift is high enough, the wavelength might shift into the optical range, which ground-based telescopes can observe.

So the key here is to find the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption line moves into the optical part of the spectrum. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. Let me think in terms of Angstroms. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha line of 1216 Angstroms needs to be redshifted into this range.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = λ_obs / λ_emit - 1.

We want the observed wavelength to be at least 4000 Angstroms because that's the start of optical. Wait, but wait, some optical telescopes might have lower limits. Let me think: the question says the lower limit, so the smallest z where the Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the observed wavelength should be 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms.

So plugging into the equation:

z = (4000 / 121
