Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they checked with TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to find out which products are formed.

Hmm, the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we start counting from the oxygen). Also, there are two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure is like:

O
||
O - C - C(CH3)2 - CH2 - CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think again. The but-3-en-1-yl group is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not right because the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, which would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2â€” wait, but for butene, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the numbering starts from the end closest to the substituent. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because a four-carbon chain would have double bonds between 1-2 or 2-3. Hmm, maybe I should imagine the structure correctly.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is the same as 1-propenyl group? No, wait. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond
