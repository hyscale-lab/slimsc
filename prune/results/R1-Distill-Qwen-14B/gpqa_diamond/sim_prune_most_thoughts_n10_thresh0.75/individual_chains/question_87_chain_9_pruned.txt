Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a compound based on some given information. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, right? And the total number of carbon atoms is 8. Wait, di-substituted aromatic rings usually have substituents attached to the ring. So if it's a benzene ring (which is 6 carbons), and it's di-substituted, that adds two more carbons from the substituents. Oh, but wait, the total is 8 carbons. Oh, okay, so the ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. But wait, maybe one substituent has more than one carbon? Or perhaps it's something else.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let me think about possible structures.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group is typically part of a larger substituent, like an acyl group. Like maybe a ketone or an ester or something. Alternatively, it could be a halogen and a carbonyl-containing substituent, like a nitro group? Wait, no, nitro doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, the carbonyl could be part of a ketone group, like an acyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. For example, one substituent could be a -CO- group attached to the ring, maybe as an ester or acyl group, and another substituent could be a halogen like Cl or Br.

Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. So, perhaps it's something like a benzene ring with one substituent being a carbonyl-containing group (like an acetyl group) and another substituent being a halogen. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a substituent that itself includes a halogen. Hmm.

Wait, but the aromatic-halogen bond could be a substituent like -
