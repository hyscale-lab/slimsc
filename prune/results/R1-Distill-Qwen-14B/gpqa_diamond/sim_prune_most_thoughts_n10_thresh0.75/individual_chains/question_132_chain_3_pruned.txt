Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Their molecular formula is C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably figure out what kind of structures these compounds could have. Both have the formula C10H14. Wait, benzene rings with substituents. Let me think: a benzene ring has six carbons, so for each compound, four more carbons are attached as substituents. But wait, wait. Wait, C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So each substituent would add to that. Let me see: C10H14 means 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Benzene has 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. So substituents add (10-6)=4 carbons and (14-6)=8 hydrogens. Wait, but substituents can vary.

Wait, if the substituents are methyl groups, each methyl is CH3. So each methyl adds one carbon and three hydrogens. So, four substituents would be four methyl groups, like 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's check the formula. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four would add 4*C and 4*3 H. So total C:6+4=10, H:6 +12 = 18. Oh wait, but the formula is C10H14. So that's 18 H for four methyl groups. But the compound has only 14 H. So that can't be. Hmm. Wait, maybe the substituents are ethyl groups? Because ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl would add two C and 7 H (since benzene is C6H6, the substituent is attached via a single bond, so for ethyl, each would add 2 C and 7 H? Wait, no, let me think again. Benzene has six C, six H. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each substituent adds 2 C and 7 H (since the group is -CH2CH3, which is 2 C and 7 H). But wait, substituents are attached to the benzene ring, so when you add an ethyl group, you're replacing a H on the benzene with the ethyl. So each ethyl would add 2 C and 7 H. For two ethyl groups, that's 4 C and 14 H, but the formula is C10H14. Wait, C6H6 plus two ethyl groups: 6 +4 = 10 C. Hydrogens
