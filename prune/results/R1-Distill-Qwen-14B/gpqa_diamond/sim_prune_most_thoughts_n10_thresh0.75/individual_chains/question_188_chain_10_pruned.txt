Okay, so I've got this crystallography question here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all their edges equal, but the angles can vary. In this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameters, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all 10 Angstroms each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times the lattice parameters, adjusted for the structure factor.

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is d = a/(√(h² + k² + l²)) ) multiplied by some factor depending on the structure. But wait, in a cubic system, that's correct, but rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, I remember that the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral structure involves the angles between the lattice vectors.

So the formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) +
