Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied, right? So in this case, when the operator P acts on this eigenvector, it just multiplies it by ħ/2.

But wait, the operator P isn't given directly. Instead, its components Px, Py, and Pz are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the full operator P is a vector operator, and I think it's the sum of the components multiplied by the unit vectors in x, y, and z directions. That is, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, the direction n is lying in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n would be zero. Oh right, because if it's in the x-z plane, then n_y=0. So P simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction vector n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or π, right? Or maybe θ is measured from the z-axis, so yeah, n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ) but since it's in x-z, φ could just be 0 or 180, but perhaps it doesn't matter because the components depend on the direction.

But wait, maybe I don't need to worry about the direction vector yet. Let me think about the operator P. The operator P is the sum of the components in the direction of n. So since n is an arbitrary unit vector in x-z plane, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in x-z, n_y is zero.

Wait no, wait. The components are given as P_x
