Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that this involves quantum numbers like isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation laws for angular momentum and parity.

First, let me parse the given information. The initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 notation refers to the spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S, so L=0 as well. So the total angular momentum J is 0 because J = L + S. So the initial state has T= some value, but after emitting X, the final state has T=0.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for the initial state, which is 1S0, S=0, L=0. So T_initial = (0 + 0) + 1 mod 2. That would be 1 mod 2, so T_initial is 1. After emission, the T_final is 0.

So the process is NN emitting X. So the initial is T=1, and the final is T=0. So the change in T is from 1 to 0, which is a change of 1. But since isospin isn't a conserved quantity like angular momentum and parity, perhaps it's more about the isospin being considered in the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but the problem is about what partial wave is not allowed. Partial waves are about the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle X. Each option gives a decay channel: the initial state 1S0 decays into a state plus X in a particular angular momentum state.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, etc. So each option shows the decay into a different final state for the NN (on the left of the +) and the emitted particle X (on the right) in a specific angular momentum state.

The problem is to figure out which of these is not allowed, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

I think I should approach this by considering each option, determining the possible angular momentum and parity, and see if they're allowed.

First, the initial state is 1S0. So J_initial = 0, since L=0 and S=0. After emission, the final NN state will have some L and S, and the emitted particle X has its own L and spin.

Wait, but in the decay process, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state consists of the NN state and the emitted particle X, each with their own angular momenta. Since they are moving in different directions, their orbital angular momentum relative to each other would contribute to the total.

But wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the NN system having a certain orbital angular momentum L, and the emitted particle X having its own orbital angular momentum. But maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the process is that the initial NN system is in a state with certain quantum numbers, and they emit X, so the emitted X carries away some angular momentum and isospin.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of parity and angular momentum. The parity of the initial state is given by the product of the intrinsic parity of the NN and the parity from their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1 (if I remember correctly, because protons and neutrons have positive intrinsic parity). So the product of their intrinsic parities is +1. The orbital angular momentum L contributes a parity of (-1)^L. Since L=0 in 1S0, the parity is +1.

So the initial parity is +1.

Now, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when X is emitted, the parity of the emitted system would involve its intrinsic parity and any orbital angular momentum it has. Let me think: the parity of the emitted X is (-1)^L_X * intrinsic_parity_X. Similarly, the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X.

Wait,
