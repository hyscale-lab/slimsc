Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. But wait, how does that affect luminosity? Hmm.

The question is about the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I'm guessing it's a square root or something like that.

Wait, I remember that for stars, luminosity depends on radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says Luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

So the first thing I need is the temperatures of both stars. But how do I find the temperatures?

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be inversely proportional to the wavelengths. Wait, no, because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. Oh, that's right! So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait wait, could that be right? Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

So now, let's get back to the luminosity formula. L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth. Since T is same for both, when we take the ratio of L1 to L2, the T terms cancel out.

So, L
