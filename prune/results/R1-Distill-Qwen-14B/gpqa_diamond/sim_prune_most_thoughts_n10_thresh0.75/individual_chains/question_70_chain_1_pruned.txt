Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read through the question carefully.

So, the question involves a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I need to figure out what each substance is based on the reactions described.

Let's break down the reactions step by step.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio. Maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio with B. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? Or perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with a gas like O2 or something else.

2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces extremely hazardous product E.
   - 2 equivalents could mean a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. Maybe D is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2, but given that E is hazardous, perhaps it's a compound like SO3 or something else. Wait, maybe C is a compound that when reacts with D forms something like a salt or an acid.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.
   - So, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Hmm. Strong and weak acids. For example, HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (weak?), or maybe HNO3 and H2CO3.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.
   - Solvent possibilities: H could be something like H2O, ethanol, or maybe a diatomic gas? But D and B reacting to form a solvent. If B is a gas, maybe D is also a gas. Another thought: if B is O2 and D is something else, their reaction could form H2O, but that's a liquid, a solvent. Wait, but O2 is a gas, so maybe D is H2? No, H2 is a gas too. Alternatively, B could be Cl2 and D could be something else.

Wait, let's try to think about possible compounds. Maybe the reactions involve transition metals or something.

Let me think about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product... could be something like FeO·nH2O? No, not red. Wait, maybe a metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another compound. Or perhaps a sulfide? Alternatively, maybe C is PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction produces E when C reacts with D. E is extremely hazardous. Perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or SO3? Or maybe something like phosgene? Or perhaps a highly reactive compound like H2O2, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a dangerous acid like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is an oxide reacting with another gas. Let's consider the possibilities for C.

Looking at the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G.

F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid, along with A.

What substances when hydrolyzed produce two different acids? Maybe a sulfite or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide? No, sulfides usually produce H2S, which is a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. If C is a nitride, like Na3N, hydrolysis would produce NH3 and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of a metal oxide. Suppose A is a metal, C is its oxide. When C reacts with water, it produces a base and possibly an acid. But in this case, it's producing two
