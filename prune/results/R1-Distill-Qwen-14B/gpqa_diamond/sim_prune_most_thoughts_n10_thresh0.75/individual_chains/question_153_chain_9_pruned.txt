Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) and some options to choose from. Let me start by recalling what Michael addition is. From what I remember, Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate intermediate. The reaction is usually catalyzed by a base, and it's a way to form carbon-carbon bonds.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a malonate ester, which is a good Michael donor. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's a good Michael acceptor.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)(OEt), right? Wait, no. Let me draw it: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3 position. Oh wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a CH2 group attached to the p-tolyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the acrylate part. Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3 position is the alpha to the carbonyl. Wait no, for acrylate, the structure is CH2=CHCOOR. So in this case, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where
