Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Let me break down the information.

So, both planets are Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, wait, but their masses are the same. Interesting. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period — three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. So same radius, but different masses.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But more specifically, the probability is proportional to R_planet^2 / (R_star^2) multiplied by (a / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, but for circular orbits, e is zero, so it simplifies. Also, the transit probability depends on the inclination. For a random inclination, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a)) ), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_p / R_s)² * (a / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) ), but for circular orbits, e is 0, so it's (R_p / R_s)² * (1/a). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the a is in the denominator, but maybe the probability also depends on the orbital separation. Hmm.

Wait, actually, the transit probability formula (for a randomly oriented orbit) is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_p/(a). Oh wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the probability larger for smaller a. But transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on, and the planet is closer to the star, which makes the transit more likely because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would cross our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(1 - (b²/a²)^0.5)), but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (a / (sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability for a planet is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)),
