Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. 

So first, I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. I remember the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40.00 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. 

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Wait, what's 25% titration mean? Oh right, it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the volume of NaOH added at this point, and then calculate the pH based on the resulting solution.

Let me find the moles of acetic acid initially. The initial volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. 

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Wait, but NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.
