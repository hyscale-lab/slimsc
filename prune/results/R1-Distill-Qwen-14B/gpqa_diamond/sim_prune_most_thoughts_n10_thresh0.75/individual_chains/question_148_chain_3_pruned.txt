Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. Let me note down the given information:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think this refers to the degree of fluorination or maybe oxygen-free fluorine?) for A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, maybe that's the percentage of fluorine by mass?

Wait, 31.96% fluorine? Let me calculate the molecular weight. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19 g/mol. So if a compound has, say, F as 31.96%, that could mean something. Let me think: suppose the compound is YF_x. So the fluorine content is (19x)/(M) *100 = 31.96. M would be the molecular weight.

Wait, but I'm not sure yet. Let's move on.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents that are fluorine compounds... like F2 itself? Or maybe something like ClF3 or similar? Wait, but Y is the other element. Hmm.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is a fluorinated form of Y. Maybe YF or YF3 or something similar.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So A5 could be a salt, perhaps, that breaks down into something else when water is added.

Now, the question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are given as ranges: 140-160, 220-240, 160-180, 110-130.

I think Y is probably a Group 17 element, maybe, but wait, fluorine is already in the compounds. Wait, no, Y is another element. Let me think: fluorine often forms binary compounds with metals, especially in the +1 oxidation state (like MF), but sometimes with nonmetals too.

Wait, the problem says there are five binary compounds. So Y must form five different compounds with fluorine. Hmm, which elements form five different fluorides? Let me think. For example, chlorine has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but wait, that's only three. Hmm. What about oxygen? No, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but that's two. Alternatively, perhaps phosphorus? It can form PF3, PF5, etc. Or maybe sulfur? S has SF4, SF6. Hmm, not enough. Wait, maybe nitrogen? NF3, but wait, that's only a couple.

Wait,
