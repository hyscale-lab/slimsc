Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The compound X is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at a certain temperature. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what X was from the options provided.

Wait, the reaction conditions... Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more commonly used in the ring-opening of epoxides, like in acid catalyzed ring opening. Or wait, maybe it's used in the formation of epoxides via the Prilezhaev oxidation? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be involved in some kind of elimination reaction or perhaps a solvent in some other context. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a catalyst in some reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a base. Or maybe it's part of the solvent system. Wait, the solvent here is nonpolar. Common nonpolar solvents include things like toluene, hexane, etc. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So the reaction is likely an epoxidation. Because if X is subjected to a reaction with an epoxidizing agent, the product would be an epoxide. Or perhaps it's the other way aroundâ€”the product is an oxide of some sort.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all options are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Or wait, maybe X is an alkene, and the reaction is an epoxidation. Let me think. The reaction in the question is between
