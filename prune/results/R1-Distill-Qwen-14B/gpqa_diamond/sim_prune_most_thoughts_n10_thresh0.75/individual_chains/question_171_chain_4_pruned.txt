Okay, so I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for these six benzene derivatives when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, I remember that the directing effects of substituents determine where the incoming electrophile attacks. 

First, each substituent is either activating or deactivating. Activating groups direct the incoming group to the ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups direct to meta. But wait, the bromine is an electrophile, so the substitution depends on the substituents' directing nature.

Looking at the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine should attack o, p positions. But wait, what's the effect on the substitution reaction? Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive, so the reaction proceeds more easily.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This is an ethoxycarbonyl group. I think the COOEt (ester) is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Deactivating groups are meta-directing. So the bromine would go to the meta position.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is a substituent. Chlorine is a halogen. Wait, isn't Cl an ortho/para director but deactivating? Because it's an electron-withdrawing group by induction but donates electrons via resonance (since it has lone pairs). Wait, but Cl is deactivating overall because the -I effect is stronger than the +R effect. So it should be meta-directing, or does it depend on the substituent's position?

Wait, no. Wait, for chlorine attached to benzene, it's a ortho/para director but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the incoming electrophile would go to ortho and para positions.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. No, wait, substituents can be either activating (like -OCH3, -NH2) or deactivating (like -NO2, -COOH). Chlorine is a substituent that is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the incoming group will go to ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromine would go to meta positions.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethyl group. Like methyl, ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine would attack o and p.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromine would go to the meta position.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Wait, but in some cases, the substituent might lead to more para substitution or less.

Wait, but for each substituent, the para isomer's percentage is determined by their directing effects. But for some groups, the para might be the major product, while for others, it's minor
