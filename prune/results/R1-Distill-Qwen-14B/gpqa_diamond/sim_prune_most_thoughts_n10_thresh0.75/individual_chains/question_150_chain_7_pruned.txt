Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by breaking it down step by step. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I have to identify the final product from the options provided.

First, the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me calculate that: (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be multiple rings and/or double bonds. Since it's an organic compound, probably a benzene ring? Because benzene contributes three DoU (three double bonds). So if there's a benzene ring, that's 3 DoU, leaving 2 more. Another double bond or a ring and a double bond. Wait, 5-3=2. So maybe another double bond and a ring? Or two double bonds? Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H), 
6.98 (d, 2H), 
6.51 (d, 2H), 
6.27 (bs, 2H), 
3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me try to interpret this. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Because if it's an aldehyde, the adjacent group would be a CH2, which has two protons.

Then, the 6.98 ppm doublet for 2H. That could be from an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and would be split into a doublet. Similarly, 6.51 ppm doublet for 2H. Another aromatic ring, perhaps ortho to substituents? Or maybe one is a substituent that's causing the shift. Wait, so perhaps two different aromatic rings or substituents on a single ring?

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with protons, like OH groups, but 2H? That's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton, but they usually show up a bit upfield. Hmm. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing a deshielded environment.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That's a slightly upfield shift. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether or an ester. Or maybe an alcohol (but that would be a triplet if adjacent to an OH). Or maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Putting this together, let me think about possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO, which can be broken down into parts. Let's see, benzene rings are a big part. If there's a benzene ring, the substituents could include an aldehyde group, some oxygen-containing groups, and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, the aldehyde proton is present, so the molecule likely has an aldehyde group. Let me think about the structure. Maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR again. The 9.72 (t, 1H) is the aldehyde proton. Then, the two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. If the molecule has two aromatic rings, each substituted in such a way that their protons are split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's one benzene ring with two substituents, each causing different shifts.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound. Like two benzene rings connected by a chain. The aldehyde is on one of the rings. Let me think: if it's a diphenyl compound, perhaps the chain in between has an aldehyde group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. If there are two benzene rings (each has 6 C), but wait, that would make 12 C, which is way more than 8. Oh wait, that can't be. So maybe only one benzene ring.

Wait, let me recount. C8H9NO: 8 carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. So that leaves 2 more carbons for substituents. But the formula also includes an O and a N. So maybe the other two carbons are part of a side chain attached to the benzene.

Wait, but then the NMR shows 3.66 ppm for 2H, perhaps a CH2 group attached to an O. Also, the 9.72 ppm for an aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and some other substituents which include oxygen and nitrogen.

Wait, the molecular formula has one N. So there must be an amine group or something else with N. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that are characteristic of amines, like around 1.5-3 ppm as broad peaks. Hmm. Maybe the N is part of a nitro group or an amide? Or perhaps a substituent that's not directly showing in the NMR. For instance, an amino group might be deprotonated or not visible in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR shows 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. If it's an amino group, perhaps it's a -NH2 group. But wait, in that case, the protons would be split into a broad peak, but a singlet for 2H. But amines usually have higher ppm and might not be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 6.27 ppm is a coupling with two protons, maybe from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like CH2O. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group, but that's usually lower in ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a structure where there's a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and an oxygen-containing substituent like a hydroxyl group or an ether. Let me think of the possible structures.

Wait, the given reagents are: first, NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat. That sequence sounds like a diazotization followed by hydrolysis. Diazonium salt formation and then hydrolysis to produce a phenol or something. So the initial compound probably has an amino group, perhaps in an aromatic position.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any obvious amino
