Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form a butanoic acid derivative.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, there's the possibility of a substitution or addition reaction. Wait, but more specifically, the reaction between ketones and cyanide ions... Oh right! It's the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, when a ketone reacts with HCN or a cyanide source, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton or something else.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is methyl propanone) reacting with NaCN (which is a source of CN- ions) and reagent A. I think the reagent A would be an acid because the formation of a cyanohydrin typically requires an acidic environment. The mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So when the carbonyl is protonated, the CN- can attack, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

Looking at the options, the reagents A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is an acid, which makes sense for the protonation step. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, what does sodium bisulfite do in reactions? Oh, right, it's a source of HSO3^- ions. I think it's used in some addition reactions, maybe in the case of sulfonamides or in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Or wait, sometimes it's used in the formation of bisulfite adducts, like in the identification of aldehydes and ketones with aqueous sulfites. But in the case of cyanohydrin formation, I think the acid is H+ from a strong acid like H3O+ or H2SO4, maybe.

So for the first reaction, reagent A should be an acid, so options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So the first part of the reaction points to A being H3O+, which would eliminate options C and D as possible answers. But wait, what if I'm wrong? Let me think again. Could NaHSO3 act as an acid here? Sodium bisulfite is a weaker acid than H3O+, but maybe in some conditions it can donate protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile, but in the presence of NaCN, the cyanide would be a stronger nucleophile than the bisulfite. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of H+ is necessary for the formation of the cyanohydrin. So I think A is H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzyl
