Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let me think this through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. We need to find what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees and what the form of f is.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the power radiated depends on the angle θ. For a dipole radiator, for example, the radiation pattern is symmetric in certain ways. Oh right, the dipole's radiation is maximum perpendicular to the axis (θ = 90 degrees), and it drops off as you go towards the poles (θ=0 or 180).

But wait, the charge distribution here is spheroidal. I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is like a donut shape (toroidal), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for a quadrupole or another multipole, the pattern changes.

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum power is A. So the function f(λ,θ) has maximum value A. We're to find what fraction of A is at θ=30 degrees, and what the dependence of f is on λ.

I remember that the radiation from an oscillating dipole has a power pattern that depends on sin²θ. The radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees. So the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So at θ = 30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25 times A, which is 1/4 of A.

But wait, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f is the radiation intensity. The total power A is the maximum of this function. So for a dipole, the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2, and the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so the maximum is 1, and the intensity elsewhere is less. So the fraction at θ=30 would be (sin30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4 of A.

So the fraction is 1/4. Now looking at the options, which options have 1/4 as the first part? Options B and C.

Now the second part is about the form of f. The function f depends on λ. For an oscillating dipole, the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4). Because the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (acceleration)^2, and the acceleration is related to the frequency, so the dependence would be on λ^−4, since power usually has units of energy per time, and λ relates to frequency as λ = c/f. So, λ^−4 would mean f ~ λ^−4.

Wait, let's think about the dependence. The power (radiated) is given by the Larmor formula. The Larmor formula for power is P = ( (μ₀ q² a² ) / (6πε₀ c³) ) * (some function of angle). The acceleration a is related to the frequency ω, and when the charge is oscillating sinusoidally, a is proportional to ω². Since ω is 2π c / λ (because c = f λ, and ω = 2πf = 2π c / λ), so ω squared is (4π² c²)/(λ²). So a² is proportional to 1/λ².

Putting that into P, P ∝ (1/λ²) * (1/λ^something else? Wait, the rest of the factors in Larmor's formula are constants if we're considering the same charge, same setup. So the overall dependence on λ would come from the acceleration's dependence. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the Larmor formula for a dipole is P = ( ( μ₀ q² ω⁴ sin²θ ) ) / ( 6π c³ ) ), or something like that. So P is proportional to ω^4 sin²θ. Since ω is 2π c / λ, ω^4 is (c^4) (2π)^4 / λ^4. So P is proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ.

So the function f(θ, λ) would be proportional to (sinθ)^2 / λ^4. So the form of f is λ^−4 multiplied by some function of θ, which in this case is sin²θ.

So the form is f ∝ λ^(-4), which matches the first part. So looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and λ^(-4). Option C is (1/4, λ^(-4)), which fits because the fraction is 1/4 and the function's λ dependence is λ^−4.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the function f is a function of λ and θ. So f is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, the pattern is (sinθ)^2, and the amplitude is proportional to 1/λ^4. So yes, the form is f = (something) * (sinθ)^2 / λ^4. So the function includes the 1/λ^4 factor.

So for the second part, the form is λ^(-4).

Putting it all together, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^(-4). So the correct option is C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle θ (from the z-axis) and the wavelength λ. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), which represents the radiated power per unit solid angle.

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \), with the maximum power occurring at \( \theta = 90^\circ \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so the fraction of the maximum power radiated at this angle is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Next, the dependence of the radiated power on \( \lambda \) is determined using the Larmor formula. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( \omega \), the power is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) has the form:

\[
f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\lambda^4}.
\]

This confirms that the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is the one where the fraction of the maximum power is \( \frac{1}{4} \) and the form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \). This corresponds to **Option C**.
