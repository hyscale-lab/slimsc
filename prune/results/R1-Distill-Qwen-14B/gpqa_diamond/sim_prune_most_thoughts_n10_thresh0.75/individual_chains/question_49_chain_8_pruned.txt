Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pericyclic reactions can be tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a conjugated system, moving a sigma bond. They usually follow the [n]m迁规则, like Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

There are three reactions to complete, and I need to pick the correct products from the options A-D. Let's go one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat → A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol with acid and heat. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2, right?

But then, we're adding but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? Wait, maybe I should draw it. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, let me think. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because but has only four carbons, so positions 1-2-3-4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. Oh, wait—actually, but-3-en-2
