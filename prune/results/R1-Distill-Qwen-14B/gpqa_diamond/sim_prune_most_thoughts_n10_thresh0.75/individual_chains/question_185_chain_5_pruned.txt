Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the Pauli vector, which consists of the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction. ε is an energy constant.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and they form the vector σ. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And each of those Pauli matrices is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, eigenvalues of a spin operator. Oh right, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of σ · n when multiplied by some constant would just scale them, I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Let me think: σ · n is a combination of the Pauli matrices. So the operator H is ε times (σ · n). Since σ · n is a spin operator in the direction of n, its eigenvalues are ±1. Because for any direction n, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ±1/2 times ħ? Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but the actual spin operator is (σ · n) times ħ/2, I think.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So
