Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several transformations to produce a final product. There are five steps in total, each producing a product (1 to 5). The options given are four different structures, all biphenyl derivatives with some substituents. My goal is to determine which option is correct.

Let me break down each step and figure out what's happening.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.
I remember that nitrating benzene typically uses a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 (nitric acid) and H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) as the catalyst. Benzene undergoes nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution reaction. The nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile. Benzene is nitrated at the meta position? Wait, no, wait. Nitration of benzene produces nitrobenzene. But where does it substitute? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitration occurs in the para position usually? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, nitration occurs in the meta position for certain substituents, but in benzene, which is completely symmetrical, the nitration can occur in any position, but the product is a mixture, but in reality, the first nitration of benzene gives a mono-substituted nitrobenzene, but the position is para? Or does it form a mixture of ortho, meta, and para? No, wait, I think that nitration of benzene under controlled conditions (like using a nitrating mixture with H2SO4 as a catalyst) typically gives nitrobenzene as the major product, but the position is actually para because of the activating effect, but wait, wait, no. Wait, benzene is an aromatic compound undergoing electrophilic substitution. The nitronium ion is a strong deactivating group, which directs incoming substituents to the para position. Wait, no, benzene is being nitrated, so it's the first substituent. So the nitro group will be added in a specific position. Wait, wait, no. Nitration of benzene yields nitrobenzene,
