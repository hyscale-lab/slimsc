Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. Right, the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For neutral hydrogen, when it absorbs or emits a photon, it transitions between energy levels, and Lyman alpha corresponds to a wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far UV, right?

Now, the question is about redshift. Redshift occurs when a light source moves away from us, causing the wavelength to stretch. So, the observed wavelength 位_obs is related to the rest wavelength 位_rest by 1 + z, where z is the redshift. So, 位_obs = 位_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, the problem is about absorption. So, if the hydrogen cloud is at some redshift z, then the quasar's light at Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms) will be absorbed by the cloud, but when the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the absorption line would be shifted further. Wait, no, the quasar's light is behind the cloud, so the cloud's redshift would be higher than the quasar's? Or the other way around?

Wait, no. The quasar emits light, which passes through the hydrogen cloud (which is between the quasar and us). The cloud can absorb certain wavelengths. The absorption line (Lyman alpha) in the quasar's spectrum would be at a wavelength corresponding to the cloud's redshift. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the Lyman alpha line would be observed at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But the question is about detecting this absorption with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, which is about 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So, the absorption line's wavelength must be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to see it. So we set 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms (since that's the start of the optical range). Wait, not necessarily. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. When observed, it's redshifted by the cloud's z. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

We need this observed wavelength to be in the optical range, which is, say, less than about 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). Wait, but wait,
