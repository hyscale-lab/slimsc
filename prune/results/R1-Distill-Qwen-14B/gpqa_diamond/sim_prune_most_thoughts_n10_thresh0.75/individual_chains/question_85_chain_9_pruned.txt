Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio. Good.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/2). But wait, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So that term is 1, and I can ignore it. So T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing up some terms here. Let me get the formula right.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is calculated based on the incident flux from the star. The star's flux at the planet's location is L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity and a is the orbital distance. The planet reflects some of that light (albedo A), so the absorbed is (1-A) times the incident. The planet then radiates as a black body, so the equilibrium temperature would be based on the energy balance.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature, T_eq, is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) )

But since e is zero, and albedo is same for both planets, the (1-A) term is the same for both, so it cancels in the ratio. So the ratio of their Teq will depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1), since R_star is same for both.

Wait, let me correct that. The formula I have is T_eq = ( (L (1 - A) )/(16 π² a² σ) )^(1/4) ), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But L is the star's luminosity, which is given by L = 4 π
