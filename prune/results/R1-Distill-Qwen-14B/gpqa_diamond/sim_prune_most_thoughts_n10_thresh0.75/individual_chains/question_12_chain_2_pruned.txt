Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu. Oh wait, right, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum must be zero. 

Alright, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

So the key here is probably using conservation of energy and momentum. I think the rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? So I can consider it as massless.

Wait, so the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino will share this energy. 

Let me think in terms of four-momentum. The invariant mass squared is s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. But wait, since the pion is at rest, p_total is zero, so s is just (139.6 MeV)^2. 

When it decays, the muon and neutrino's four-momenta add up to that. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = |p_nu| c. And the muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy plus any other, but wait, actually, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

But because of conservation of momentum, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. So p_mu = p_nu. Wait, no, wait. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|, and they're vectors pointing in opposite directions. So their vector sum is zero.

So, let's set p_mu = p and p_nu = p, but
