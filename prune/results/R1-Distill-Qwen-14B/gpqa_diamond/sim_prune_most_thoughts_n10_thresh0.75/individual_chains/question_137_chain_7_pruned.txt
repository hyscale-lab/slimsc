Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences, but maybe that's not crucial for solving this problem.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

And the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A) 1864, B) 5300, C) 3536, D) 2500.

Wait, I think in cyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field, and the electric field accelerates them as they pass through the gaps between the dees. Each time they go through an acceleration, they gain some kinetic energy. So each half-revolution (going from one D to the other and back) might correspond to one acceleration.

But I need to think about how the voltage relates to the energy gained. Oh right, the energy gained per acceleration is equal to the voltage multiplied by the charge. Since the proton has charge e, each time it passes through the gap, it gains energy e * U. But wait, the voltage here is time-dependent. Hmm, but maybe in the case of a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is synchronized with the motion of the particle, so that each time the proton passes through the gap, the electric field is at its maximum, providing maximum energy gain each time.

Wait, but the problem mentions two accelerations. Wait, actually, the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe that's a specific setup detail. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.

First, I need to figure out how much energy the proton gains. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so T ≈ 0. The final is 950 MeV.

Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied. But wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains energy once per half-revolution. Because the electric field alternates, so when the proton is moving towards a D, the field is in one direction, and when it goes back, it's in the other direction, but perhaps the voltage is applied in a way that the particle always gets a push in the same direction.

Wait, the voltage U(t) is given as U0 cos(2πν(α) t + Φ0). So the frequency of the voltage is related to the
