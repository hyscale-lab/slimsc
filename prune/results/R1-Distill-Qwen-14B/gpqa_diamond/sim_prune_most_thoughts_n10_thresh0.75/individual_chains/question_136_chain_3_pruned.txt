Okay, so I have this problem about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me think. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, divergence theorem? Oh right, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. So, instead of calculating the volume integral directly, maybe I can use this theorem. Because the divergence theorem says that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, what's the vector field f(r) here? The problem says it's only along the radial direction and has magnitude 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Because it's radial only, the other components (like theta and phi) are zero.

So to find the divergence of f, I need to compute ∇ · f. I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A which has components A_r, A_theta, A_phi is given by:

(1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(A_phi sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [1/ dφ (something)].

Wait no, the exact formula is:

∇ · A = (1/r²) [d(r² A_r)/dr] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [d(A_φ)/dφ] ]

But in our case, A_θ and A_φ are zero because the field is only radial. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr. Since A_r is 1/r², let's plug that in.

So A_r = 1/r². Then r² A_r = (r²)(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1
