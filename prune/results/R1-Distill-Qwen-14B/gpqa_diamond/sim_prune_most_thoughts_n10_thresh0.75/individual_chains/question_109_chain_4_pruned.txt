Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me think. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the given conditions. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh right, the initial state is 1S0, so let's break that down.

The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means 2S +1 =1, so S must be 0. Because 2*0 +1=1. So S is 0 for the initial state. The L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So L is 0 because the term is 1S. And J is 0, right? Because it's the last number in 1S0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the system emits a particle X. The final state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin T is 0. The Pauli condition given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, let me think about what each represents. T is the isospin of the NN system after emitting X. S is their total spin, L is their orbital angular momentum, and X has some angular momentum too.

Wait, the problem says that the Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So for the final state of the two nucleons, their isospin T equals (their spin S plus their orbital angular momentum L plus 1) mod 2.

Since the final state has T(NN)=0, let's plug that into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, which means S+L must be odd. So S + L â‰¡ 1 mod 2.

So in the final NN state, S and L must add to an odd number. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

But wait, what is S for the NN system? The initial state is S=0. So when the system emits the particle X, how does the spin change?

Hmm, I think the spin of the system might involve the spin of X as well. Because the initial NN system has S=0, and when they emit X, which probably has some spin, the total spin should be conserved.

Wait, no. Angular momentum is conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state's total angular momentum J_final should be the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L') of the NN system, their spin (S'), and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

Wait, no. The problem is considering the NN system as a whole after emission. So the system emits X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state (with T, S', L') plus X in some state with angular momentum. But the problem is only considering the NN system's properties, not the X's. Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is about the partial waves of the emitted particle, so the X's angular momentum state is a lowercase letter, like s, p, d, f. Each of these has a specific L for X.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, J=0. After emitting X, the final state of the NN system has T=0, and their own S', L', which must satisfy T = S' + L' +1 mod 2.

So S' + L' +1 must be even, so S' + L' must be odd.

But the initial state has S=0, L=0. So the total angular momentum J_initial is 0. So the final state must have J_final = J_initial + angular momentum of X. Wait no, because the system is the two nucleons, so their J would be the sum of their spin S and orbital L. But when they emit X, the system's J would have to change? Or wait, perhaps the total angular momentum is conserved for the entire system (including X), but the problem is only considering the NN system's quantum numbers.

Hmm, maybe I should think about parity conservation as well. The initial parity is given by the state 1S0. The parity of an atomic state is (-1)^L. So L=0, so parity is (+1). But wait, the parity can also depend on the spin and other factors. Or in the context of particle emission, the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final states, considering the parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial * other factors. For an NN system, the parity might be (-1)^L, considering that the orbital angular momentum contributes to parity. But wait, when a particle is emitted, what factors into the parity? The parity of the initial state equals the product of the parities of the final states multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum part contributes a (-1)^L factor to the parity.

Wait, so the initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial.

The final parity is P_final = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.

Because the emitted particle X carries away some orbital angular momentum L_X, which contributes to the parity change.

So the initial state is 1S0, L_initial = 0. So P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.

The final state's parity P_final must equal P_initial, so:

+1 = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.

What's the parity of X? The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So P_X = -1.

So substituting:

+1 = P_NN_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X.

Simplify that: 1 = (-1) * (-1)^L_X * P_NN_final.

So 1 = (-1)^{L_X +1} * P_NN_final.

So, P_NN_final = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

But the parity of the NN system in the final state is given by their own L, right? Because for a bound system, the parity is (-1)^L. So P_NN_final = (-1)^{L'}.

So from earlier, (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1)^1 = (-1)^{L_X -1}.

Wait, let me see: (-1)^{L_X +1} = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1)^1 = (-1)^{L_X} * (-1
