Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in their energy measurements. But wait, when you measure the energy, the uncertainty for each state is their own ΔE. So, if the difference ΔE is larger than each of their individual uncertainties, you can tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states. No, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. So for each state, the energy spread is ΔE_i. If ΔE (the energy difference) is much larger than either ΔE1 or ΔE2, then the two states can be distinguished.

But wait, another way to think: to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference should be at least equal to the sum of the individual energy uncertainties. Or perhaps the maximum of the two? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. So, if the energy difference is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two levels will be distinguishable.

Wait, let's compute the energy uncertainties for both states.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are given in eV, perhaps it's easier to compute in eV·seconds. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, let's convert ħ into eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. Yes, I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

For the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculation for ΔE1.

τ1 is 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔE1 is ~6.6e-7 eV.

ΔE2 is 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or, wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is larger than both, then they won't overlap and can be distinguished.

Wait, actually, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is larger than, say, the uncertainty for
