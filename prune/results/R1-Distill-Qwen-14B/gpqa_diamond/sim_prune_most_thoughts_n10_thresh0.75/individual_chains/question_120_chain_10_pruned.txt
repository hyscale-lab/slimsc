Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So higher parallax means closer stars because they're moving more against the background. 

But the question isn't directly about distance; it's about the number of stars per unit parallax. So the distribution here is uniform in terms of the sky, but how does that translate to parallax? I think we need to consider the volume of space corresponding to a given range of parallax.

Oh wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume. The key is to find how this volume changes with parallax.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance (d), so d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by a small amount, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let me see, if plx increases, d decreases. The volume between two spheres of radii d and d + dd would be the volume element. 

Wait, the volume between two spheres is 4Ï€(d^
