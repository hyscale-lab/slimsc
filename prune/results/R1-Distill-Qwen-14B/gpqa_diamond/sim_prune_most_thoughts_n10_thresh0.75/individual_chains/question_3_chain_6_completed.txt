Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and I need to compute the expectation value of 10σz +5σx.

First, let me write down what I know. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/4, which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, that saves me from having to normalize it later.

The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value is the average value we'd measure for this operator on this state. Since expectation values are linear, I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then combine them.

So, E = ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state.

I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So, for σz, the expectation value is just the probability of spin-up times (+1) plus the probability of spin-down times (-1).

Looking at the state |ψ⟩, the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2=0.25. Similarly, the amplitude for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the computational basis (|↑⟩, |↓⟩). The expectation value of σx is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩, you get |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩, you get |↑⟩.

I can compute ⟨σx⟩ as follows:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓|) σx (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ )

Let me expand this.

First, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So,

= 0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩
+ (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩

But wait, σx is Hermitian, so ⟨a|σx|b⟩ = (⟨b|σx|a⟩)*.

But let me compute each term:

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0.

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↓|↓⟩ =1.

⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ =0.

So substituting these in:

= 0.5 * 0.5 * 0
+ 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * 1
+ (sqrt(3)/2) *0.5 * 1
+ (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * 0

Now, let me compute each term.

First term is 0.

Second term: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Third term: same as second term, because 0.5* (sqrt(3)/2) is the same. So another (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Fourth term is zero.

So adding these two non-zero terms: 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660 approximately.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate it exactly. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/4 is about 0.433. So two times that is 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly with fractions.

So 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3))/4, and the same for the third term. So both together are (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, but wait a second, am I doing this correctly? Because when dealing with expectation values, sometimes people use another approach.

Alternatively, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to note that σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the state vector can be written as a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

The state vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. The conjugate transpose is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let's compute this matrix product.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩:

σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† * (σx |ψ⟩) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's the same as before. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So adding these together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 5*(1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2 =4.330125.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So total expectation is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σz is |a|² - |b|², because |↑⟩ is +1 and |↓⟩ is -1. So |a|^2 is 0.25, |b|^2 is 0.75.

So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

For σx, another approach is to calculate it as 2*(|b|^2 - |a|^2) ? Wait no, that's for σx when the state is a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, but I think that approach might be incorrect. Let me think.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is (|b|^2 +|a|^2 ) ??? No, wait. Because σx is a Hermitian matrix with trace zero. Maybe another approach.

Wait, the expectation value of σx is 2*(Re(b a*)) ?

Wait, because in general for a state a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re( a^* b ), because:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * 0 + a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 *0.

But ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ is 1, so it becomes a b^* + a^* b = 2 Re( a b^* ). So yes.

So in this case, a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So a b^* = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. The real part is same as the value, since it's real.

So 2 Re(a b^*) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4)= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. Same as before. So correct.

So then expectation value of 10σz+5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -5 + 4.330125 ≈-0.669875, which is approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but the question asks for one decimal. So that's -0.7.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer is C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in \( |\psi\rangle \):

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle)(+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle)(-1) = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a general state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(a^* b).
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}\left(0.5^* \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
Using the linearity of expectation values:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
