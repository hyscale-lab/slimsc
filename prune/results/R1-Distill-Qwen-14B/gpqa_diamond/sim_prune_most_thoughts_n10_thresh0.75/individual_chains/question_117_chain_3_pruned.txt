Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which of the given moieties show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I recall, has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other. That usually means the compound has a chiral center, right? Or maybe some other kind of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism (cis-trans) but I think that's more about double bonds.

Wait, no, optical isomerism is a subset of stereoisomerism. So stereoisomers can be optical if they are chiral, meaning they lack a plane of symmetry and have a non-superimposable mirror image. So I need to check each of the options to see if they have such features.

Let's look at each one:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' (on each benzene) and 2 and 2' (also on each benzene). So the substituents are two nitro groups on each ring at 6 and another two at 2 positions. Wait, but the main point is the possibility of the molecule being chiral.

Wait, biphenyl can have a single bond between the two benzene rings, which allows for rotation unless there's a substituent that restricts it. In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Depending on their arrangement, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If all substituents are in a symmetrical arrangement, then it might not be chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, how? The substituents are on both rings. Wait, if it's 2 and 2' for the carboxylate groups and 6 and 6' for the nitro groups, perhaps the arrangement is such that it's symmetrical. Like, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is a mirror image of itself, then no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the overall molecule asymmetrical, then it could have optical isomerism. Let me think about the structure. The two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2. So each ring has two substituents, para to each other.

Wait, no, positions 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are not para. Wait, position 1 is the point of connection. So position 2 is adjacent (ortho), and position 6 is the next (meta?) Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring. The positions go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 around the ring. So 1 is the connecting point. Then on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6: so 2 is ortho to 1, and 6 is meta? Wait, 1, 2 is next, 1, 3 is meta, 1,4 para. So 6 is across from 1? No, 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1? So 1 and 6 are adjacent.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out mentally. Each ring has a substituent at position 2 (ortho to the connecting bond) and another at 6 (also ortho on the other side). So each ring has two substituents, each at ortho positions, but on opposite sides?

Wait, but if each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6, which are both ortho to the connecting bond, then the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. So the two substituents on each ring are both ortho, opposite each other.

In that case, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two rings are connected and each has substituents on both sides, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the central axis connecting the two rings. If that's the case, then the molecule would not be chiral and wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the substituents' arrangement leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the central bond, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back to this one.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

Wait, the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH
