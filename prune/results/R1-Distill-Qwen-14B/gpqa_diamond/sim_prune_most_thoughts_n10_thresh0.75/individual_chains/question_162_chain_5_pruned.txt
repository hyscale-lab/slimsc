Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2D metric, right? Because it has dx² and dy² terms. That makes sense because a pseudosphere is a 2D surface.

Wait, wait. I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So, the metric given here should correspond to such a space. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat since it's written as a multiple of (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Now, when you have a metric like this, the area element is the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal and each component is the same (after factoring out the (dx²+dy²)), the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor.

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element in 2D for a metric g_{ij} is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Alternatively, since the metric is conformally flat, the area element is the conformal factor squared times dx dy. Wait, no, let me get this right.

The metric tensor g in this case is diagonal: g_{
