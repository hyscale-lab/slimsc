Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together. I remember that when an acid reacts with a base, they undergo a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid and base react to form water. 

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the enthalpy when all three are mixed. That must mean figuring out the neutralization between the acids and the base. So I need to find out how much each acid contributes to the reaction and then sum it up.

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and the base because the neutralization depends on the moles reacting. Oh right, the limiting reagent is important here because the reaction can only proceed as far as the limiting reagent allows.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

For HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL (0.3 L) and molarity is 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, moles of H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction between acids and base. The H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base to form water.

Total H+ available: from HCl and H2SO4. HCl gives 0.1 moles H+, H2SO4 gives 0.18, so total H+ is 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So which is the limiting reagent here? Let's see. The H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent because it's less. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the OH- will neutralize H+ from both acids. So the neutralization reaction would involve the OH- reacting with the available H+.

So the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+.

So how much H+ is neutralized? 0.2 moles. That leaves 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting. So the reaction will use up all the OH-, using 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of water formed is 0.2 moles, but wait, each H+ and OH- makes one mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles H2O.

Wait, but wait, what about the enthalpy of neutralization. I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized, or something like that. Wait, but wait, no, I think it's about -57 kJ per mole of acid, but wait, no, maybe per mole of H+.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization, ΔH, is typically given as the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. For strong acids and bases, it's approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ.

Wait, wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as per mole of acid. But in this case, since it's a neutralization between H+ and OH-, it's per mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have different units; some are in kcal, others in kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So I have -11.4 kJ. Let me see: 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 kJ is about 239.006 cal. Hmm, but wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

Wait, the calculation I did is in kJ, so I can compare with options D and the others.

Wait, but wait another thing: I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (which is per mole of acid). Wait, no, wait, no, sometimes it's given per mole of acid, but for monoprotic acids, it's per mole of H+. For diprotic, each mole gives two H+, so their neutralization would release twice as much.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So for a monoprotic acid, like HCl, each mole gives one mole of H+, so ΔH is -57 kJ per mole of HCl.

For H2SO4, which is diprotic, each mole provides two moles of H+. So when it reacts with a base, each mole would contribute two times the neutralization enthalpy. So the ΔH per mole of H2SO4 would be about -114 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, actually, for H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second dissociation is also complete, giving another H+ and SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+. So when neutralized, each mole would release twice the enthalpy.

Wait, but when the problem is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction, it's the sum of all H+ from all acids reacting with OH-.

Alternatively, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is about -57 kJ. So in this problem, the total enthalpy would be moles of H+ neutralized multiplied by -57 kJ per mole.

Wait, but in this case, the moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2 moles. So 0.2 * -57 = -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- and see the neutralization.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is used up. Since OH- is less (0.2 vs 0.28), it'll be the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH- to form 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * ΔH per mole of H+.

Assuming ΔH is -57 kJ per mole H+.

So total ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but now I'm confused. Because the problem is giving options in both kcal and kJ. And my calculation is in kJ, so D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than my value of -11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ΔH. Maybe it's -57 kcal? No, no, because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. Wait, wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal.

So if I have -11.4 kJ, that's roughly -11.4 * 0.239 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Oh, that's option A. But wait, why would the enthalpy be calculated in kJ and then converted to kcal? Because some options are in kcal.

Wait, no, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically given in kJ. But the options have both. So I need to be careful.

Wait, another approach: sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given as approximately -57 kJ per mole of acid, but that's for strong monoprotic acids. For diprotic acids, each mole would contribute 2 * (-57) kJ. So let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ neutralized and multiply by the standard enthalpy per H+.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ. But that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is different. I thought it's about -57 kJ per mole, but maybe the value is different.

Wait, actually, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+. But wait, I think the question might be using a different value. Let me think: sometimes it's given as -57.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that would make it 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. That's close to option B, which is -11.42 kcal. But that's in kcal, not kJ.

Wait, if I convert -11.46 kJ to kcal, it's 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but why would the enthalpy of neutralization be in kcal? Because in some contexts, especially older texts, calories are used. But the question's options have both.

Wait, another point: I'm assuming that all the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. So the OH- is definitely 0.2 moles.

Wait, but another thought: the Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles, each giving 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles is correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH- reacting. So the total H+ used is 0.2, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, wait another point: perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57.3 kcal/mol? No, that can't be right because 57.3 kcal is way too high. Wait, 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. Oh wait, no, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ). So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Divided by 4.184, that's approximately 13,600 calories, which is 13.6 kcal.

So if the ΔH is -57 kJ per mole, that's -13.6 kcal per mole of H+. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * -13.6 ≈ -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait wait, but that makes sense because 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.6 kJ, which is 13.6 kcal. Wait, no, because 1 kJ is 0.239 kcal, so 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kcal. So 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal, so per mole H+.

So for 0.2 moles H+, the ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 * 0.239 kcal ≈-2.72 kcal.

Ah, so the correct answer would be option A, -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why the discrepancy between the options? Because some options are in kJ and others in kcal.

The question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the correct approach is to find the moles of H+ neutralized, multiply by the standard ΔH per mole H+.

So if ΔH is -57 kJ/mol H+, then 0.2 mol →-11.4 kJ. But in the options, the only one in kJ is D) -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps the standard ΔH is considered as -57 kcal/mol? That can't be, because that's a huge number.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units. Let me think again. If the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of H+, then 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kJ. But if the question's answer expects kcal, then 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈0.239 kcal). So 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal, negative.

So the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why would the answer be in kcal? Because some textbooks use kcal for such calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of 1 cal = 4.184 J, but that's for energy in more precise terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy is taken as -3.80 kcal per mole of H+? Then 0.2 * (-3.80) = -0.76, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between per mole of acid and per mole of H+. Let me try another approach.

The problem says "enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed."

The formula for enthalpy of neutralization is generally expressed as:

ΔH = -n * (heat per mole of H+)

Where n is the moles of H+ neutralized.

Alternatively, sometimes it's given per mole of acid, but in this case, since we're mixing multiple acids and a base, it's the total H+ reacting.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

Moles of H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.2 mol.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol H+ will react.

If the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kJ, then ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ. No match.

Alternatively, if the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57.3 kcal, that would be way too high, because 0.2 * 57.3 is 11.46 kcal, which is option B: -11.42 kcal. Close, but wait, that would be if the ΔH is -57.3 kcal/mol H+, which is incorrect because 57.3 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, not 57.3.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the standard value in kJ and then see which option matches.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck between the units. Let me recheck the standard value.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So that's approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, there's no option with that value in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. So that doesn't match.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So yes, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the limiting is OH-, so 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, no: because 11.46 kJ is 11,460 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 J/kcal. So 11460 / 4184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal, which matches option A.

Hmm, so the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is there an option D in kJ? Because the calculation gives -11.46 kJ, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the overall reaction, not per mole of H+. Or maybe the enthalpy is per mole of reaction as written.

Wait, the neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O. So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it's -57.3 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should look for calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of acid, not per H+.

Wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid: each mole gives 1 H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic: each mole gives 2 H+.

But the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2.

So if the standard enthalpy is -57.3 kJ per mole of H+, then it's 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

None of the options in kJ match, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Which is approximately -11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, let me convert 11.46 kJ to kcal.

1 kJ = 0.239 kcal.

So 11.46 kJ * 0.239 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So -2.737 kcal is approximately -2.74 kcal.

So the answer should be option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But why would the question give an option in kJ? Because some people might think in terms of kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy is taken as -3.80 kJ per mole of H+. Then 0.2 moles would be -0.76 kJ, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The correct approach is to compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

Limiting is OH-, so 0.2 H+ neutralized.

Enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kJ.

So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the correct answer is none, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I did a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, not per H+. For monoprotic acids, it's about -57 kJ per mole of acid, because each mole gives one H+. For diprotic, it's about -114 kJ per mole, as each gives two H+.

Wait, so perhaps the approach is to calculate the moles of each acid and base, considering their H+ contributions, then find the total H+ neutralized and multiply by the standard ΔH per H+.

But that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak? No, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, and the second is also considered strong, so both H+ are released.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Which is approximately -11.4 kJ. But that's not matching any of the options in kJ. Wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, no, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent since it is present in fewer moles.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ} \) per mole of H⁺.  
   - Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ are neutralized, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - \(-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}\).

5. **Analyze the options:**
   - Option A (\(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\)) matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - Option B (\(-11.42 \, \text{kcal}\)) does not match, as it represents an incorrect conversion of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Option C (\(-3.80 \, \text{kcal}\)) is incorrect.  
   - Option D (\(-16.0 \, \text{kJ}\)) is incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
