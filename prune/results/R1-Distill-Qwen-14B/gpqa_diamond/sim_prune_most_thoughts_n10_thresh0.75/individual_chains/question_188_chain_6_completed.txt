Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all the angles are the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by something like d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + ... ) but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh yeah, I think it's d = a / sqrt( l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ ), but wait, that's when the unit cell isn't cubic. Since rhombohedral has all edges equal (a = b = c) and angles equal (α=β=γ), maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, another thought: I remember that for a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)). But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so the formula should be more involved. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk (cos α) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos γ)) ))).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but wait, no, that can't be right because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so the cosine terms would vanish and you get the familiar cubic formula. So yes, that seems correct.

In this problem, the crystal is rhombohedral, so a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The plane in question is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. Plugging these into the formula.

So first, compute each part. Let's compute the denominator first.

Denominator = sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) )

Wait, because α, β, γ are all 30 degrees, each cross term is cos(30). So let's compute each part.

Calculating the squares: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Now the cross terms: 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) *3 times because there are three different cross terms (hk, hl, kl). Wait, wait no. Wait, the formula is 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ. Since h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1*cos(30). So each cross term is 2*cos(30), and there are three of them because hk, hl, kl. So total cross terms = 3 * (2 * cos 30) = 6 cos 30.

So the total inside the sqrt is 3 + 6 cos(30 degrees).

Wait, what's cos(30 degrees) in exact terms? Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196).

Calculating sqrt(8.196). Let's see, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(8.196) is a bit less. Let me compute 2.86^2 is 8.1796, 2.86^2=8.1796. 2.87^2=8.2369. So 2.86^2=8.1796, which is less than 8.196, so the square root is approximately 2.862.

So denominator is approx 2.862. Then d = a / denominator.

a is 10 Angstrom, so d = 10 / 2.862 ≈ let's compute that.

10 / 2.862 is about 3.492. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 8-10 Angstrom. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did I switch a with something else? No, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell parameter a is the edge length, which is the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but wait, the formula I used, d = a / sqrt( ... ), but when the angles are not 90 degrees, the formula uses the unit cell parameters. Oh wait, maybe I confused the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. So for (hkl) planes, the formula simplifies.

Wait another thought: maybe it's better to use the formula in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: In a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the edges, which is 30 degrees here.

Wait, let me make sure. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So plugging in, we have:

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1 + 1 + 1) * cos 30 )

Because the cross terms: 2hk cos α = 2*1*1*cos(30), same for the others. So in this case, 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30) = 6 * cos(30).

Wait, but earlier I had 3 + 6 cos(30), which is correct.

So 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, 3*1.732 is about 5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.862. Then d =10 / 2.862 ≈ 3.492 Angstrom. But wait, the options are all around 8-10 Angstrom. That's way off. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I used the formula for a different crystal system. Let's check the formula again.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d = [ (a² (b² c² - (b² + c²) cos² α + (b² + c² - a²) cos² β ... )) ) ]^(1/2) / ... Hmm, no, that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula expressed in terms of the reciprocal basis vectors.

Wait, another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h^* = (1/(a)) (1, 1/(sin α), 1/(sin α) ), but this seems unclear.

Alternatively, using the general formula for interplanar distance:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1/a²) + ... ) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute using the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is given by:

G = [
[ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ],
[ a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
[ a² cos α, a² cos alpha, a² ]
]

Wait, but that's a 3x3 matrix. The formula for d is 1/sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos γ ), but wait, no, that's not correct. Another idea: The formula for d is 1/sqrt( (h G11 + k G22 + l G33) + 2( h k G12 + h l G13 + k l G23 )) ), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the general formula for d is 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, wait, that's similar to what I thought earlier. So for rhombohedral, since α=β=γ=30°, and a=b=c=10.

So plugging in, for (111):

d = 1 / sqrt( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is 1 / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

So sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So 3 +6*0.866 = 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

So d=1/(2.862) ≈ 0.349 Angstrom. No, wait that can't be right because a is 10 Angstrom, and the options are in that range.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, wait, I think I forgot that the formula is d = a / sqrt(...). Because the reciprocal is involved. Let me look it up in my mind. Oh yes, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, I think it's d = a / sqrt( sum of terms ), where sum is h² +k² + l² plus cross terms.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the formula, perhaps the denominator is (h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ ), but that would be when a, b, c are different. But in the case where a = b = c, and α=β=γ, perhaps it is.

Wait, let me rederive the formula. The interplanar distance d is given by 1/d = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + other terms. No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure factor.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors (h, k, l) are given by:

b_h = (2π/a) (1, 1/(sin α), 1/(sin α) )

Wait, no, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the plane's normal vector.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Since all the edges are a and the angles are the same, the formula for (hkl) planes is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos α + 2 kl cos α )

Because in rhombohedral, α=β=γ.

So for (111), h=k=l=1, so:

d = a / sqrt( 1 +1 +1 + 2*(1)(1) cos 30 + 2*(1)(1) cos 30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

a is 10 Angstrom.

Compute cos30: sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 3 +6*(0.8660) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

So d=10 / 2.862 ≈3.492 Angstrom. But the options are way higher, like 8.95, 9.08, etc. So I must be making a mistake because this can't be right.

Wait a minute, wait! Oh wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that's the same as before. So why am I getting a value so much lower than the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the reciprocal lattice parameter. Wait, another thought: Maybe I'm confusing miller indices with reciprocal lattice.

Wait, I think I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because for a cubic system, angles are 90, cos 90 is zero, so it becomes 1/sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct. So perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, wait, but then for a cubic system, it would be d = a/sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct. So maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but that can't be right because when angles are 90°, the cos terms are zero, so it's correct. But in the case of rhombohedral, the angles are 30°, so cos 30 is positive. So let me try that.

Using this formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

For (111): h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (1)(1) cos 30 )) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*0.866 )

Compute 6*0.866=5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196. Oh wait, taking sqrt of a negative number is impossible, so that can't be correct. So that formula must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe using the relationship between interplanar distance and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the edges (30° in this case).

So for (111), h=k=l=1:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2(3) cos30 )

a=10, so:

3 + 6 * 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

d=10 / 2.862 ≈3.492 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is way higher. So that's impossible. Hence, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not a, but something else. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length a. So in this case, a=10.

Wait, but why am I getting such a small d? The interplanar distance can't be smaller than the interatomic distance, can it? Wait, no, for example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is a*sqrt(3)/3, which is about 5.77 Angstrom for a=10. So 3.492 is even smaller, but it's possible? Maybe I made an error in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance as:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, that might be the correct formula.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So 1/d² = (3)/(10²) + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )/(10² )

= 3/100 + 2*(3 * 0.866)/100

= 3/100 + (6 * 0.866)/100

= 3/100 + 5.196/100

= (3 +5.196)/100 = 8.196/100 = 0.08196

Then d² =1/0.08196 ≈ 12.201

So d = sqrt(12.201) ≈3.492. Again, same result. So the interplanar distance is about 3.49 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm applying the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I'm confusing the Miller indices (hkl) with another parameter. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the interplanar spacing in a different way, maybe using the reciprocal lattice. Or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the distance. Wait, no, that would complicate things.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the interplanar distance formula is given as:

d = [ a² + b² + c² - 2(ab cos γ) - 2(ac cos β) - 2(bc cos α) ]^(-1/2) * (h² +k² + l² )

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the volume of the unit cell. The volume V is a^3, since a=b=c and angles are 30°, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane is a close-packed plane, and the interplanar distance is larger than the interatomic distance. But according to my calculation, it's smaller, which seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the formula's denominator is (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) minus the cross terms. Let me test that.

So 3 - 6 * 0.866 =3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative, so can't take the square root.

So that approach is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think differently. The interplanar distance can also be calculated using the vectors of the plane.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors a, b, c are all equal in length and have the same angles between each other. The (111) plane has normal vector n = a + b + c.

The interplanar distance d is given by the magnitude of the vector (a + b + c) divided by the square root of the sum of squares of the coefficients, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vector. Hmm, perhaps.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b_h = (2π/a) (1, 1, 1) ?

Wait, no, that's for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are more complicated.

Wait, the reciprocal of the lattice vector a is given by:

b_h = (2π/a) [ 1, cos α / sin α, cos α / sin α ]

But I'm not confident about this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But that leads to the same result as before, which conflicts with the answer options.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are 30 degrees, but in the formula, it's the angles between the axes. In a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are equal, but perhaps when calculating the interplanar distance, the angles used are 180-30=150 degrees. Hmm, that's a possibility. Because sometimes in crystallography, the acute and obtuse angles matter.

Wait, for example, when the angle between two vectors is 30 degrees, the dot product is a*b cos θ. But if the angle is 150 degrees, the cos is negative. So perhaps I should use cos(150) instead of cos(30).

Because when the angle between the edges is 30 degrees, but when calculating certain distances, we might need to take the supplementary angle. Let me think about this.

Wait, the angle between the edges a and b is 30 degrees, so the angle between the reciprocal vectors would be 180-30=150 degrees. So the cos would be cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So let's try that. Let me recalculate with cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2.

So for the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute 6*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 3*(-sqrt(3)) ≈-5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Again, negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = [ (a² + b² + c² - 2 a b cos γ - 2 a c cos β - 2 b c cos α ) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ]^0.5

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c =10, and α=β=γ=30.

So numerator becomes:

10² + 10² +10² - 2*(10*10 cos30) - 2*(10*10 cos30) - 2*(10*10 cos30 )

= 3*100 - 6*100*cos30

= 300 - 600*(0.866) ≈300 -519.6 = -219.6.

Wait, that's negative, taking sqrt is impossible. So that can't be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a² + b² + c²) / (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (a b cos γ + a c cos β + b c cos α ) / (h² +k² +l² )

So plugging in the numbers:

a=b=c=10, h=k=l=1, α=β=γ=30.

So:

d² = (100 + 100 +100 ) / (3) - 2*(100 cos30 + 100 cos30 + 100 cos30 ) /3

= (300/3) - 2*(300 cos30)/3

= 100 - 2*(300 * 0.866)/3

= 100 - 2*(259.8)/3

=100 - (519.6)/3

=100 - 173.2

= -73.2.

Which is negative, impossible again.

Hmm, this is frustrating. I'm not getting the right approach here. Let me think of a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume of the unit cell and then relate it to the interplanar distance. The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cos α cos β cos gamma ), but I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos³α )

Since α=β=γ=30°, let's compute V.

So V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute each part:

(0.866)^2 = 0.75; (0.866)^3 ≈0.6495.

So 3*(0.75)=2.25; 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So inside the sqrt: 1 -2.25 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.25 = 2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈1000 * 0.2214≈221.4 Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the interplanar distance.

Wait, the interplanar distance d is related to the volume and the area of the face, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) ) * sqrt( 1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

Wait, let me try that.

So for (111), h=k=l=1, so h² +k² +l²=3.

So sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

So denominator term is sqrt(3) * sqrt( 1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Wait, that's the same as sqrt(3)*sqrt(V/(a^3)) ), because earlier V= a^3 * sqrt(1-3 cos² + 2 cos^3 ), so sqrt(V/(a^3)) = sqrt( sqrt(1-3 cos² + 2 cos^3) ) ?

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try plugging the numbers into this formula.

So, d = a / [ sqrt(3) * sqrt( 1 -3*(cos30)^2 + 2*(cos30)^3 ) ]

Compute 1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 -2.25 +1.299 = same as earlier: 0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

So denominator is sqrt(3)*0.2214≈1.732 *0.2214≈0.383.

So d=10/0.383≈26.1 Angstrom. This is way too big compared to the options. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and consider that the correct formula is the one I first used, and perhaps the given options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used the angles as 60 degrees instead of 30. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles are given as the angles between the vectors, but perhaps for the formula, they use the angles between the edges as 60 degrees. Let me test that.

Wait, but the question states alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, and the answer is around 3.49 Angstrom, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Wait, cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So let me recalculate the denominator:

3 +6*(-0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative again, impossible.

Hmm, this is really confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula I'm using is for orthorhombic systems and not rhombohedral. Maybe the correct formula for rhombohedral is different.

Wait, looking for another approach, perhaps I can use the relation between the interplanar distance and the structure factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the lattice constants in terms of the reciprocal space.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative sources.

Wait, another idea: The interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the edges.

So for (111):

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.862≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the face-centered cubic approach, but no, that's a cubic system.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interatomic distance in a different way, perhaps by considering the vectors of the (111) plane.

In a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's normal vector is a + b + c. The distance between two adjacent planes is the magnitude of this vector divided by its norm.

Wait, the vector from (000) to (111) in reciprocal space is (1,1,1), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space.

Wait, the reciprocal space vectors are given by:

b_h = (2π/a) (1, 1/(sin α), 1/(sin α) )

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, but the options are in reciprocal space. But no, the options are in Angstrom.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Compute 3 +6*(cos30) =3 +6*(0.8660)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

d=10/2.862≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps the given formula is wrong, or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that gives 3 -6*(0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative, so no.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - θ) )

Which would be cos(150)= -0.866.

So 3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196. Still negative.

Hmm. Maybe I should accept that I'm not recalling the correct formula and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the following formula for a rhombohedral system:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the axes, which is 30 degrees.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reciprocal of the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )/(a^2)

So,

1/d^2 = [3 + 6 cos30 ] / (10^2)

= [3 +5.196 ] /100

=8.196/100=0.08196

So d=1/sqrt(0.08196)≈3.49 Angstrom.

Same result again.

Wait, perhaps the given options are incorrect. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is not about a primitive rhombohedral cell but a conventional cell, which is a cube. But that's not the case because the question says rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the distance using the unit cell's face diagonal or space diagonal.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane's interplanar distance is related to the face diagonal. But that's in a cubic system. For a rhombohedral, it's more complicated.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I have and see if any of the options match when considering a different approach.

Wait, let me think of the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b_h = (1/a) (1, 1, 1 ) if the system is cubic. But rhombohedral is not cubic, so this approach won't work.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters using the following formula:

d = (a^2 (1 + 2 cos α )) / sqrt( (1 + cos α)^2 + (1 + cos α)^2 + (1 + cos α)^2 + ... )

Wait, that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I can't find the correct formula and that the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach by considering the vectors in the rhombohedral system.

The (111) plane has a normal vector along a + b + c. The distance between the planes is given by the formula:

d = (a + b + c) · n / |n|^2,

where n is the normal vector. Wait, no, perhaps that's for something else.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance is the magnitude of (a + b + c) divided by the square root of (h² +k² + l^2 + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )).

Wait, but that brings me back to the same formula as before.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should compare with the options and see which one is close to my calculation.

Wait, my calculation gives d≈3.49 Angstrom, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the actual interplanar distance is much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + ... ), but that would make d larger. But then I don't know what the correct approach is.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ), which for (111) gives d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstrom. But that's not among the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the (111) plane as a hexagonal close-packed plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system in terms of the lattice constant a and the angles.

The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which is what I've been using.

So for (111), h=k=l=1:

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.862≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this doesn't match any options. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question refers to the lattice parameter a as the distance between adjacent atoms in a particular direction. But in a rhombohedral system, a is the edge length, not the interatomic distance. Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is 10 Angstrom.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, such as the (100) direction, making a different from the edge length.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I can't find a way to get an answer matching the options, perhaps I should pick the option closest to my calculation, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196). Impossible. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula without the 2 factor in the cross terms.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 + hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma )

So for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 + (3 * 0.866 ) )

=10/sqrt(3 +2.598)=10/sqrt(5.598)=10/2.366≈4.225 Angstrom. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 + ... )

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cosα + 2 hl cosbeta + 2 kl cosgamma )

Wait, no, that's what I've been doing.

I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct approach. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since my calculation gives about 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are much higher, perhaps I should look for the reciprocal.

Wait, if I take the reciprocal of 3.49, I get about 0.286. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula and the correct denominator is (h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that gave a negative number. So I can't use that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given interatomic distance is not a, but the edge length is a different value. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which is the same as a in a rhombohedral system. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that would give 3 -5.196=-2.196, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}

No, that's the same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Given that, I'll proceed with the calculation I have, and perhaps the correct option is not among those given, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the angles are 60 degrees, which would change the calculation.

Wait, if the angles were 60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

Then denominator would be 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449, so d=10/2.449≈4.082 Angstrom. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, if the angles are 120 degrees, cos120= -0.5.

Then denominator:3 +6*(-0.5)=3-3=0, which is impossible.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and perhaps made a mistake in the initial formula. Given that, I'll proceed to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since this option isn't present, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the reciprocal, so d = 1/ (a * sqrt(...)). But that would give d≈0.286, which is even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) ), which would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.774 Angstrom. Still not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the face-centered cubic approach, but it's a cubic system and the question is about rhombohedral.

Since I can't find a way to get any of the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ), which for (111) gives 10/sqrt(3)=5.774 Angstrom. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha )

So for (111):

sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + 2 cos30 )

cos30=0.8660, so 1+2*0.866=2.732.

sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So d=10/(sqrt(3)*1.652) =10/(1.732*1.652)≈10/(2.862)≈3.49 Angstrom. Again the same result.

Hmm.

Maybe I should throw in the towel and choose the option closest to my result, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula and the correct approach is different.

Since I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the intended answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom. But I can't see how to reach that with the given data.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the interplanar distance formula is given by d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos(180-α) + hl cos(180-β) + kl cos(180-γ) )) )

So cos(150)=-0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196. Again negative, impossible.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find a way to get any of the given options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom, but I can't see how to derive it.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Key Information:
- **Interatomic distance (edge length):** \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- **Miller indices:** \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \)
- **Angles:** \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- **Cosine values:** \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator:** \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
2. **Denominator:**
   \[
   \sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}
   \]
   Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = 0.866 \):
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{3 + 5.196}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.862
   \]

3. **Interplanar distance:**
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.862} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- The calculated value \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)).
- Despite extensive recalculations and exploring alternative approaches, the result remains consistent. It is unclear how the given options align with the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The calculated interplanar distance is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but this value does not match any of the provided options. Based on the given choices, the closest option is **B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning behind this discrepancy remains unclear.
