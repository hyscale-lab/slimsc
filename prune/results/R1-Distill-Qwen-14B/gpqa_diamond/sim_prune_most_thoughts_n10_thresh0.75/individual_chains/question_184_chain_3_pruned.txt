Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. Hmm, the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me break down the structure to figure out the steps needed.

First, looking at the substituents on the benzene ring: there's a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts at one substituent, right? Let me visualize that. If the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl is at 2, and nitro at 3. That would make them meta to each other but not exactly, because positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way. Oh wait, maybe I should draw this.

But since I can't draw, I'll imagine. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3 in a row. That's a meta arrangement for some of them, but maybe that's not the main issue.

I remember that when substituting benzene, the order in which you add substituents affects where they end up. For example, if you have activating groups, they can guide the next substitution. But nitro is a deactivating group, so any substitution after that would have to happen before the nitro is added, or perhaps use a different directing effect.

Wait, but wait: nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director). Tert-butyl is a bulky groupâ€”it's a deactivating group because it's an alkyl group, which is activating but bulky. Wait no, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through induction, but they are ortho/para directors because they're bulky, they tend to direct incoming groups to para more than ortho maybe?

Wait, but the positions are important here. So, the target has three substituents. Let me think about the order of adding these groups.

I think the general approach is to add the groups in an order that allows for the correct directing. For instance, adding a nitro group first would deactivates the ring, making it harder to add other groups. Alternatively, adding the ethoxy first (which is activating) might be better because it can direct the next substituent.

Wait, but in this target, the ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl at position 2. So, if I add ethoxy first, then the next substituent could be added at the para position relative to ethoxy (position 4), but the target has substituents at 2 and 3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Another approach: the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nit
