Okay, so I've got this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically involving spin-half particles and expectation values. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured a certain observable many times on identically prepared systems. Right.

The question says that the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. Oh right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, which I think has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The operator we need to find the expectation value of is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Since expectation values are linear, this should split into 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Right, because expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations.

So I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, I should check if the state is normalized. Let's see: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

So ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let's compute that. |a|^2 is (0.5)^2=0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2= 3/4=0.75. So 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Next, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I think has the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates of σx are |+⟩ and |-⟩, which are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value by using ψ's coefficients.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ for a state ψ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Let me write this out.

Expressed as a vector, |ψ⟩ is [a, b]^T, since |↑⟩ is the first basis vector and |↓⟩ the second. So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σx ψ is the inner product of [a*, b*] with σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, another approach: the expectation value of σx is 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) ? Wait, no, that's for σz. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices' expectation values can be found using their properties. Alternatively, I can compute it directly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b) because σx in the z-basis has off-diagonal elements. Let me think.

Wait, when you compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, that's (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|) σx (a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩). σx |↑
