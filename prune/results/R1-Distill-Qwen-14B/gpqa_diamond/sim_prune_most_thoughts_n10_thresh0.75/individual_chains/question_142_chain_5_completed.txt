Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. The given matrix is a 2x2 matrix since it's dealing with qubits.

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, a general qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and the identity matrix I. The general form is ρ = (I + a·σ)/2, where a is a vector (a_x, a_y, a_a) and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

So for our ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write that out. |0⟩ is [1,0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = I/2.

Wait, so ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. Because I is the identity matrix, and a is (0,0,0). So that would mean the vector a is all zeros. 

But wait, another way to think about this is the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector of a density matrix is given by the coefficients in front of the Pauli matrices. For ρ = (I + a_x σx + a_y σy + a_z σz)/2, the vector a is (a_x, a_y, a_z). 

In our case, the density matrix is (I)/2. So all the coefficients a_x, a_y, a_z are zero. That means the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin. 

But wait, wait. I've heard that the completely mixed state for a qubit is (I/2). Because when a qubit is completely mixed, it's in a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, with equal probabilities. And on the Bloch sphere, this mixed state is at the center, the origin. So the point (0,0,0) makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A is (1,1,0) — that's some point on the Bloch sphere, but not the origin.

Option B is (0,0,1) — that's the north pole, which I think is the state |0⟩ if it's pure, but since our state is a mixed state, this isn't right.

Option C is (0,0,0) — yes, that's the origin. So this should be the correct one.

Option D is (1,1,1) — that's outside the Bloch sphere because the vector would have a magnitude sqrt(3), which is more than 1. So that's not possible for a density matrix, which must have a Bloch vector of length ≤1.

So the geometrical position is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a general qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices, meaning \(\mathbf{a} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state of a qubit.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\))**: This represents a point on the Bloch sphere, but it is not the origin. Incorrect.
- **Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\))**: This corresponds to the north pole of the Bloch sphere, which represents the pure state \(|0\rangle\). Incorrect.
- **Option C (\(r = (0,0,0)\))**: This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which matches the given mixed state. Correct.
- **Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\))**: This point lies outside the Bloch sphere (its magnitude exceeds 1), which is not physically valid for a density matrix. Incorrect.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
