Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely confident with all the concepts here. But I'll try to take it step by step and think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with metal-ligand complexes, stability constants (formation constants) are crucial. The stability constant, β, tells us how stable a particular complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The problem gives me the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, so βn is the stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So for Co(SCN)_n^2-n, βn is the formation constant for that specific complex.

I think the key here is to calculate the distribution of all possible complexes and then find the percentage contributed by the dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the Co(SCN)_2 complex because dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So that's the third β, β2=40, wait no—wait, let me clarify. Wait, no: the complex with two SCN^- ligands would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? Because each SCN is -1, so two would be -2, and the Co is +2, so overall charge is 0. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the β2 would be the formation constant for that complex. Wait, but the β's given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (since 3*-1 + 2+ gives -1), and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I recall that the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is blue. So we're looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the species with two SCN ligands attached to Co^2+.

So, to find the percentage of this species among all cobalt species, I need to calculate the fraction of Co in each possible complex and then sum them up. But how?

I think the approach is to consider all possible complexes that Co can form with SCN^- and then use the stability constants to find the distribution. The general approach for such problems is to use the formation constants and the concentrations to find the fraction of each complex.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants. The fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is proportional to β_n multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible n.

Wait, but wait,
