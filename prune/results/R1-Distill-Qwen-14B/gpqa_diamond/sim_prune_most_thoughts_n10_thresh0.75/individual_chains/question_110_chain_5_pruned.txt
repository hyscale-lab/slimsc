Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. From the question, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, which means it can see stars that are up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, the star needs to be bright enough (apparent V magnitude <= 16 and <=17, so the strictest is <=16) to be seen by both.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag (since brighter means lower magnitude numbers). Similarly, HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag in V (so apparent magnitude ≤17) can be seen by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag ≤16. Therefore, a star that both can detect must have an apparent V mag ≤16 because that's the stricter condition.

So, each star needs to have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both. But wait, some stars' apparent magnitudes might be affected by interstellar extinction (dust), which is why some stars have E(B-V) given. Because when light passes through dust, it gets absorbed and scattered, making the star appear dimmer and redder. The V magnitude is in the visual range, so extinction will make it appear fainter (higher magnitude) than it actually is.

So, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude, considering extinction for those stars that have E(B-V). Let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute magnitude Mv is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude (mv) is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log(10/10)= log(1)=0. So mv=15.5. Star1's apparent V is 15.5 mag. Now, does extinction affect it? The star's E(B-V) isn't given, so I think we can assume no extinction. So mv=15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it? Wait, ESPRESSO can see up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So Star1's mv is 15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both can detect it.

Wait no, wait the initial part: the question says that for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So, if the instrument can observe stars brighter than
