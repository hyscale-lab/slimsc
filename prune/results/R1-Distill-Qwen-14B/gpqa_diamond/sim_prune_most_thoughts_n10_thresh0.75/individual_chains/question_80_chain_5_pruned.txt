Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes some DNA sequences and converts them into numbers. My job is to figure out what the algorithm is doing so I can apply it to the given input and find the correct output from the options provided.

Let me look at the examples given. The first one is AGG -> 115. Hmm, so the input is a DNA sequence, and the output is a number. I need to find a pattern or a rule that converts AGG to 115 and TGCTGA to 176. Then I can use that same rule on ACAGTGACC.

First, I'll think about what each nucleotide could represent numerically. DNA is made up of A, T, C, G. Maybe each letter is converted to a number. Let's see:

A, T, C, G. Wait, but in what order? Maybe A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or maybe A=0, T=1, etc. Let me test some possibilities.

Looking at the first example: AGG. So that's A, G, G. Let's assign numbers to each.

If A is 1, G is 4. So AGG would be 1,4,4. Now, how do these numbers turn into 115? Well, 1 + 4 +4 =9, which isn't 115. Maybe multiplication? 1*4*4=16. Not 115. Hmm, maybe concatenation? 1 followed by 4 and 4 would be 144, but that's not 115. Wait, maybe each pair or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of each DNA base as a digit in a different base. DNA is four bases, so maybe base 4? But how would that work with the output being 115? Let's see. Wait, 115 in base 10. Maybe each nucleotide's number is multiplied by a certain value based on its position.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is converted into its position in the DNA alphabet. A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. So AGG would be 1,4,4. Now, maybe each digit is treated as a digit in a number in base 10. So 144, but the output is 115. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe each base's value is based on its position in the sequence, like A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then AGG would be 0, 3, 3. Summing gives 6, which doesn't match. Or perhaps the product, 0*3*3=0. No, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps each base is converted to its complement. Wait, but that's more about pairing. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each base is converted to a numerical value based on the order in the DNA structure, like A=1, T=5 (since it's the first in the alphabet), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe using the ASCII values. Let me check that.

The ASCII value for A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71. AGG would be 65,71,71. Summing these: 65+71+71=207. Not 115. Alternatively, product: 65*71*71 = 31715, which is way too big.

Hmm, another approach. Maybe each base is represented by a single digit, and the entire sequence is treated as a number in a certain base. Let's see what base would make AGG translate to 115.

Wait, 115 in base 10. Suppose each base is a digit in base 10, so AGG would be 1,4,4. The number would be 144, which is larger than 115. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the letters are converted to their
