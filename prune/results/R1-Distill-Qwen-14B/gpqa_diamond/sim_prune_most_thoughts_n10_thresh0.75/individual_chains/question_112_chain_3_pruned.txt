Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about an electron's spin state and measuring the probability of it being in certain eigenstates of a given operator. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator. Hmm, alright.

The state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities require the state to be normalized (i.e., the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1).

Wait, the state is proportional, so the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] divided by the normalization factor. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the moduli of the coefficients.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. Let me compute their moduli squared.

For (1+i), the modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

For (2-i), modulus squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the size of this matrix? Since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, the Hilbert space is 2-dimensional, so the matrix is 2x2.

So the matrix A looks like this:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

So the operator is actually ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix, if I'm not mistaken. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on-diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the measurement probabilities depend on the eigenstates of the operator A.

The Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1 with corresponding eigenvectors. Let me recall: σ_x |+x> = |+x>, σ_x |−x> = −|−x>.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So
