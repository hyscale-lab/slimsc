Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I remember from my classes that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and energy is released because some mass is converted into energy. But wait, the problem is about comparing the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energies of the fragments.

The initial nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial mass is M, and after splitting, the total rest mass is 0.99M. That suggests that some mass was lost, converted into kinetic energy or other forms. But I think in this case, the kinetic energy is what we're focusing on.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 and the one calculated using the classical approximation.

I think I should start by figuring out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the two fragments as fragment A and fragment B. Let's say fragment A is more massive than B, so its mass is 2x, and fragment B is x.

So, the sum of their rest masses is 2x + x = 3x. According to the problem, 3x = 0.99M. So x = (0.99M)/3 = 0.33M. So fragment A is 2x = 0.66M, and B is 0.33M.

Wait, but M is the original mass. So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99M. So the initial rest energy was 300 GeV, which is Mc². So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c² = 300 GeV. But after splitting, the rest mass energy is 0.99M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

But wait, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the rest energy after is 297 GeV. So that's a loss of 3
