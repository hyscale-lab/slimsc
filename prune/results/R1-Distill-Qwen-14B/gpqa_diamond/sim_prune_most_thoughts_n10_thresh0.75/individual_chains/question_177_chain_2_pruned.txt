Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, both stars have the same emission peak wavelength. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question asks about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming both radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, I remember that black body radiation relates to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The luminosity of a star is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, that's if they don't have any peculiar velocities. Oh, right! But wait, the stars have radial velocities. So, because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelengths would be different. But the problem states that the *wavelengths at which they appear brightest* are the same. Hmm. So, the intrinsic emission peaks are at the same wavelength? Or is it that the observed wavelengths are the same?

Wait, let's read it again. The question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. That's important because the Doppler shift would affect the observed temperature.

So, let's think about how Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (if moving away, v is positive; towards us, negative). But wait, this is a relativistic formula. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately λ ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c). But since we're dealing with stars with velocities much less than the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is small), the non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

So, the observed λ_max for each star is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, shorter (blueshifted).

In the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0
