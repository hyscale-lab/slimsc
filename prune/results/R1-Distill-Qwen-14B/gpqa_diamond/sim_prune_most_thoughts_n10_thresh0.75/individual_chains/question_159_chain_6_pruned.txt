Okay, so I've got this science question here about quasars and the universe's comoving distance. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that there's a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, flux dropping at shorter wavelengths... I think that's related to redshift. Because if the peak is in the infrared, maybe the quasar is emitting in the optical, but due to redshift, it appears in the infrared.

So, the peak wavelength is 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared. I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, around 121 nm. But if the observed wavelength is longer, that's because of redshift. So the quasar's emission might be from a higher redshift.

Wait, no, the peak is in the near-infrared, but maybe that's the rest frame. Or is it the observed frame? Oh, the question says the peak is at 790 nm in the observations, which are in near-IR and optical. So wait, in the observed spectrum, the peak is at 790 nm. But if the quasar emits in the optical, that would imply that it's redshifted into the near-infrared. Hmm, maybe the quasar emits a certain rest wavelength, but due to redshift, we see it longer.

Wait, the drop in flux below 790 nm suggests that the quasar's emission in shorter wavelengths (bluer) is weaker than at the peak. So perhaps the peak corresponds to the rest wavelength of some emission line. Like, say, the Lyman-alpha line at 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then we can compute the redshift.

Redshift z is calculated as observed wavelength divided by rest wavelength minus 1. So z = (observed / rest) - 1. Let me plug in the numbers. Observed is 790 nm, rest is 121 nm? Wait, but wait—does the peak at 790 nm correspond to Lyman-alpha, or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the peak is due to another line. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The near-infrared peak at 790 nm could be due to the Lyman-alpha emission line being redshifted. Let's check: Lyman-alpha is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If observed at 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 6.49. So z ≈ 6.5.

But wait, why are they observing in near-IR and optical? If the quasar is at high redshift, its optical emission would be shifted into the infrared. So that makes sense. So the redshift here is about 6.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, given the current cosmological parameters. The parameters are Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m =0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total =1).

Comoving distance D_C for a given redshift z is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula. Oh right, the comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c / (H0 * E(z')) dz'. And E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ + Ω_k (1+z)^2 ), but since the universe is flat, Ω_k=0. So E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So for a given z, we need to compute this integral. But I
