Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P has in the first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will give 0.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, which is a matrix. The possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of this operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. I think the observable P here is given, and I need to find the probability of getting 0 when I measure it. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of a specific outcome, which is 0.

Wait, but step by step. Let's think. So the state vector is a column matrix [-1; 2; 1]. Let me denote this as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

The operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Its element in row i, column j is given. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, the first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

The second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

So the matrix P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3
