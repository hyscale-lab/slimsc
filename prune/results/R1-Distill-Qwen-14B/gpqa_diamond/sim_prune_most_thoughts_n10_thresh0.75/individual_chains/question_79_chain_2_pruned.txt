Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which compound X it is. Let's see. The compound is C11H12O. It went through a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent used for? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base, maybe used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Or wait, no, sometimes it's used as a catalyst in certain reactions, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a base in a deprotection reaction. Hmm.

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides with some substituents. So the reaction probably involves the epoxide ring opening. Wait, but the problem says the product's spectra are given, so I'm supposed to figure out what the structure of the product is, then backtrack to find X.

Wait no, the question says the product is from compound X reacting with the base, so the product is likely an epoxide. Or wait, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening? Or perhaps the base is causing ring opening but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination or addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, but if X is an epoxide, and it's reacting with a base, maybe it's opening to form something else. But the product's NMR data is given, so perhaps the product is a diol, but the product's NMR doesn't show any OH groups. Hmm.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift; maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, 197 is in the range of ketones or maybe esters. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, but those are typically around 200. Wait, but what about a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone? Or perhaps an epoxide ring opening leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening followed by some kind of elimination. Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a lot of carbons in the aromatic region. Let's look at the data.

The 1H NMR of the product has signals:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So two singlets for 3H each. Maybe two methyl groups attached to something deshielded, like perhaps attached to aromatic rings or something else.

The aromatic region is from 6.75 to 7.71. Let me see: 6.75 is a doublet (d), 7.08 is a doublet of 2H, 7.68
