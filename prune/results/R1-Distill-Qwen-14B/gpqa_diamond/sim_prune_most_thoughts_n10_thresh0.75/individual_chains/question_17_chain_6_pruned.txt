Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And they give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal.

Wait, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which is probably the calcium EDTA complex, maybe like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA ion.

So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But they're asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the EDTA forms a complex, the calcium isn't all free; most of it is tied up in the complex.

I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction for the formation would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

And the Kf is [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA. I think Kf is the same as what's given here, so Kf = 5e10.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh wait, the pH is ideal—probably such that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the different species. So we can treat EDTA as Y^4-.

So in this case, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, how much Ca²+ would be released? Let me think about the expression.

The complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. Let's let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x, and free EDTA be y. But wait, because for each complex that dissociates, we get one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-
