Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which reaction sequence will give me 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Wait, benzene rings are numbered such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, nitro and bromo groups are at positions 3 and 5? Or maybe 3-bromo and 5-nitro or vice versa. But the numbering would be to have the substituents at the lowest possible numbers. Wait, let me think: the substituents would be at 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 5 and a bromine at position 3. And attached to the ring is a ketone group (ethanone) at position 1, but wait, ethan-1-one would be R-C(=O)-CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula is C6H3(NO2)(Br)COCH3. So the substituents are nitro, bromo, and a ketone (COCH3) group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, no. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Oh, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So it's a benzene ring where one substituent is (COCH3) at position 1, and then bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to plan the synthesis steps. So I need to introduce a ketone group (COCH3), a bromine, and a nitro group onto the benzene ring, in the correct positions.

But wait, benzene is the starting material. So I'll need to do electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which these groups are introduced
