Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and leading to a final product. I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on the final product, product 4.

Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a mouthful. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So it's a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7, which is the bridgehead. The molecule is also diene, so it has two double bonds. Wait, no, it's bicyclo with two double bonds? Or maybe it's a diene with two double bonds. Wait, hepta-2,5-diene would have double bonds at positions 2 and 5. So the structure would be a seven-membered ring with two double bonds and the bicyclo framework.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product is 1. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile and a source of iodide ions. The other reagent is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups at 5 and 6 positions. So each of those positions has a BrCH2 group attached.

Wait, the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene would be a cyclohexene ring with double bonds at 1 and 3. Positions 5 and 6 each have a CH2Br2 group, right? Wait, no. Dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 substituent.

So when this reacts with the starting material, which is a diene, probably undergoing some Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material has conjugated dienes. The other molecule also has conjugated dienes because cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a 1,3-diene.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a norbornene derivative with two double bonds. So, two double bonds in a norbornene framework. So, maybe it's a di-ene, but the other molecule is also a diene. So perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction isn't the case here. Alternatively, it's a diene reacting with another diene. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good catalyst for elimination or perhaps an E2 mechanism, but in this context, maybe it's a Diels-Alder with two dienes.

Wait, but more likely, in this case, the starting material is a diene (it has two double bonds), and the other reagent is a dienophile. Or perhaps it's undergoing some cycloaddition. Alternatively, since there's an electron-deficient dienophile, maybe it's a Diels-Alder. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2
