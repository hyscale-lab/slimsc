Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. Let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. The first step is treating it with bromine to form product 1. Cyclohexanone has a ketone group, and bromine—oh wait, I think when a ketone reacts with bromine, especially under certain conditions, it undergoes a bromination. Wait, cyclohexanone has an alpha position next to the carbonyl. So when you add bromine (Br2) in a solvent like maybe something that can stabilize the enolate... Oh right, I think it's a conjugate addition or maybe a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, that's more for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine, perhaps it's an electrophilic addition. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, which is a carbonyl group. Oh wait, another possibility: bromine adds across the carbonyl group, but that doesn't sound right because ketones don't usually do that under normal conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide substitution. Wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a good leaving group except maybe in some specific conditions.

Wait, another approach. Oh, maybe it's an alpha bromination. Because the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So when you treat a ketone with bromine, you can get a bromine added to the alpha position. So, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons—each CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So adding Br would lead to a mono-substituted product. Wait, but bromine is diatomic, so would it add as Br+ maybe? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes with strong bases. Or wait, maybe it's the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction for alpha bromination. Oh right, that's for carboxylic acids, but wait, no, wait. The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii adds bromine to alpha positions of carboxylic acids, but cyclohexanone is a ketone. Oh, but I think for ketones, alpha bromination can occur under certain conditions. Like using a catalyst, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more straightforward.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl. But bromine is a dienophile sometimes. Hmm, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, the carbonyl is a double bond. So adding Br2 across the carbonyl would give a dibromide. But wait, that's not correct because ketones don't typically react with bromine in that way; that's more for alkenes. Unless it's under specific conditions, like maybe in a base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a bromohydrin. Because in some cases, adding Br2 with water can form a bromohydrin. But wait, the question says it's treated with bromine (Br2)
