Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M (10^-2 M), and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (beta) measures the stability of a complex ion. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, the complex with the highest beta is the most favored.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ions attached. Wait, no, wait—wait, dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_n where n=2 or something else? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, no, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n²+ where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The first complex would be Co(SCN), the second Co(SCN)₂, etc. Each has a different stability constant β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), etc. Wait, but the formula might vary based on charge. Let me think about that.

Wait, the charge on Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 -n), I think. So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2-1=+1). For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), because 2-2=0. Wait, that can't be right because SCN- is a monoanion. So if n=2, the complex would have charge 0? Hmm, but that's possible if it's a neutral complex. Or is it that the charge is 2 - n. So for n=3, it would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But wait, maybe the complexes are all [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - n). So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1). So the stability constants are given for each step.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But wait, that's four stability constants. How does that work? Oh, maybe each β corresponds to the formation of the next complex. Like β1 is
