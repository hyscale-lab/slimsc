Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So the cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and an allyl group at position 5. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2CHCH2, but attached at the middle carbon, right? So it's an isopropenyl group. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

First step: treated with sodium hydride, then benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so maybe deprotonating something. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So perhaps an SN2 reaction? The starting material has a ketone at position 1. The hydroxymethyl group is at 3, so maybe that's an acidic proton because it's next to a ketone. So sodium hydride would deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group, making an enolate? Wait, no, the hydroxymethyl is CH2OH. Deprotonating that would give a CH2O- which could attack the benzyl bromide.

Wait, but the hydroxymethyl is at position 3. So after deprotonation, it would become a CH2O- which then would react with benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) in an alkylation. So that would add a benzyl group to the oxygen? Wait, no. Wait, the hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH attached to the cyclohexane. When you deprotonate, you get -CH2O- which can attack benzyl bromide. Benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br. So the benzyl group would attach to the oxygen, making PhCH2-O-CH2-cyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it's an SN2 reaction where the oxygen attacks the benzyl bromide. So the product would have a benzyl ether group attached where the hydroxymethyl was.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)... which is a secondary alcohol. Sodium hydride is a strong base. Deprotonating that would give a strong base, like an alkoxide. Then benzyl bromide would alkylate it. So the hydroxymethyl becomes -O-CH2Ph? No, wait. Let me think: when you deprotonate the hydroxymethyl, you get a cyclohexane ring with a CH2O- group. Then reacting with benzyl bromide (which is PhCH2Br) would substitute the bromide. The benzyl group would attach to the oxygen, so the product would have a benzyl ether. So the structure would be 3- (benzyl-O-CH2- ) cyclohexanone? Wait, no, the ketone is at position 1. So the structure would be 3- (benzy
