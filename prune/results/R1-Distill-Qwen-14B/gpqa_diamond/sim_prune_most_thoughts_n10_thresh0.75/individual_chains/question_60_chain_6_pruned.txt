Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I think I can figure it out.

So the question is about time dilation in space travel. There's an alien spaceship moving at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are that the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, or one of the other age options.

Wait, time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. When you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone stationary. But wait, no, actually, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip would take less time because of the Lorentz factor.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says to calculate the time from the astronaut's point of view. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloudâ€”I think that's a key factor here. Wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, the problem says the aliens are traveling to Earth, but I don't have the distance. Oh wait, maybe the question expects me to know the distance or assume something else. Wait, maybe the speed given is so close to c that the time is negligible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is
