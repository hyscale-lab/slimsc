Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me a lot of data. Let's break it down. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth radii.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, but I don't have the distances. Hmm, how do I find that?

Oh, wait, the question mentions the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the distance between the planet and the star. Oh yeah, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star's movement.

The question says that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å. Oh wait, these are periodic shifts, so they correspond to the velocity of the star. The shift (delta lambda) is due to the Doppler effect, so delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. So v = c * delta_lambda / lambda.

Wait, the formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda/lambda = v/c. But we have delta_lambda as 0.03 Å and lambda is 6300 Å. So for Planet1, v1 = c * (0.03/6300). Similarly for Planet2, v2 = c * (0.04/6300).

But wait, since the star's velocity is due to the planet's gravitational pull, the velocity of the star (v) is related to the planet's orbital period and the distance. Wait, no, more precisely, the relationship is given by the radial velocity method formula: v = (2π G / (P c))^(1/3)
