Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference over a certain time. Let me think through this.

Wait, the problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So that means they're not accelerating, just moving at constant velocities relative to each other. That's important because in Newtonian mechanics, when two frames are inertial, you can use the Galilean transformations, right? But wait, wait a second. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, when things are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity and the Lorentz transformations. But here, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me think about what that is in terms of the speed of light.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light. Oh, that's pretty fast. So relativistic effects might be significant here. Hmm, that changes things because Galilean transformations don't apply when speeds are a significant fraction of c.

But wait, the problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to relate time in one frame to the other. I think that's where time dilation comes into play. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow.

Wait, let me clarify the situation. According to the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in their frame, the galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.

But wait, no, actually, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. Because the problem states that both are inertial frames, so the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. So the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the
