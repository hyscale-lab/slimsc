Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

Alright, the question says that we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think represents the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is related to the Balmer series in hydrogen, so maybe that's the H-alpha line or something. 

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term... Oh right, that's probably the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, and the energy levels split due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the atom and the external field. So the paramagnetic term would be the energy shift due to this effect.

The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for orbital motion is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m) * (L), where L is the orbital angular momentum. But wait, orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh right, the orbital contribution is μ_L = (μ_B) m_l, where m_l is the magnetic quantum number.

Since the field is along Oz, the z-component of the angular momentum is L_z, and the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m_l * B. 

But wait, the question mentions the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic substances have electrons with parallel spins, and their magnetic moments contribute to the paramagnetism. So maybe in this case, the coupling is due to the spin magnetic moment, not the orbital. Oh, but wait, the orbital term is usually considered separately. Hmm. Wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term", so perhaps it's the spin-orbit coupling? Wait no, spin-orbit is a different effect. Or maybe it's the Zeeman effect due to the spin. 

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, which relates to the orbital angular momentum. But electrons also have spin, which contributes
