Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that the density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what exactly is a density matrix's geometrical position? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, every quantum state can be represented as a vector in a 3D space. For a qubit, the state is usually written as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, and this corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere with coordinates (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So the density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ| would be represented by this Bloch vector.

But wait, the given density matrix isn't just a pure state. Let me look at the matrix given: ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are equally probable when measured, and they are orthogonal. So this isn't a pure state; it's a mixed state. But how does that translate into the Bloch vector?

I remember that the density matrix can also be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find the components of r.

Let's write out the given ρ: it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. The |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal, but since we're dividing by 2, it's (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] = [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. 

Now, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So the general form is ρ = (I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz ) / 2.

Expanding that, I gets (I) as [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. The other terms: rx σx is rx * [[0,1],[1,0]], so rx/2 times [[0, 2], [2, 0]]? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. If I have rx σx, that's rx * [[0,1],[1,0]]. When you add that to I and then divide by 2, each term is multiplied by 1/2.

So the general expression becomes:

(1/2) * [[1, 0],[0, 1]] + (rx/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]] + (ry/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] + (rz/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

But wait, the given ρ is diagonal. Let's see what that implies for the rx, ry, and rz terms.

Looking at the given ρ, the (1,2) and
