Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to unpack what's going on.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving different substances. Let me break down each part:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Hmm. So I think I'm supposed to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by figuring out what each compound could be, based on the reactions.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Common reactions that form bright red products... I'm thinking maybe something like a metal reacting with a gas. For example, maybe sulfur reacting with something? Or maybe a transition metal forming a compound.

Wait, another thought: bright red products could be like certain transition metal ions. For example, I know that when metals like copper react with certain gases, they form colored compounds. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Reaction 4 says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But D and B reacting 1:1... perhaps D is something like H2O? Or maybe B is something like Cl2, and D is H2O? Not sure yet.

Let me think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak.

Wait, this is a key clue. What produces two different acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe something like a sulfite or sulfate ester? Or perhaps a nitrate ester? Alternatively, thinking about something like a nitrate salt that hydrolyzes into nitric and another acid.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a nitrate salt. If C is, say, copper nitrate, then upon hydrolysis with water, it would produce nitric acid (strong) and copper hydroxide, which would decompose further. But wait, in the problem, it's reforming A. So A would be the metal, perhaps.

Wait, let's outline:

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, what combination makes sense? Let's think about nitric acid (HNO3, strong) and maybe another acid like H2SO3 (weak?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, but upon hydrolysis, sulfites form H2SO3 (weak acid), but what else? Not sure.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 is a lot, so maybe each A is combining with 8 B molecules.

Looking for a compound where the central atom has an oxidation state that might require 8 electrons. For example, sulfur in a high oxidation state. Sulfur can have a maximum oxidation state of +6. For example, in H2SO4, sulfur is +6.

Wait, but how many equivalents of B? If B is a gas, maybe O2? Because O2 is a common gas. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2? Or another diatomic gas.

Wait, another angle: the product C is used in the second reaction, where it reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio to form E. So C reacts with D to make E.

Looking for C that when reacted with a gas D produces a hazardous product E.

Wait, putting all these together, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Because nitrates can decompose upon heating, especially with other reagents, to form hazardous products.

Let me consider that. Suppose A is a metal, say, copper. Then B could be oxygen, and reaction 1 is copper reacting with O2 to form CuO, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur? No, because solid A reacting with gas B to form a red product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium, B is chlorine. 8 equivalents... Wait, sodium has a valency of +1, so 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl atoms. That can't be right because sodium would form NaCl. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be a lot, and I don't think that forms a red product.

Alternatively, let me think about a reaction where a metal reacts with another gas to form a compound with high symmetry. For example, maybe a transition metal like Fe forming FeO (which is black, not red) or Fe3O4 (also black). Hmm.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe C is a compound of sulfur. Sulfur forms various compounds. For example, when copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, it forms CuSO4, which is blue. Not red.

Wait, the product C is bright red. I'm trying to think of red compounds. Maybe something like Fe(OH)3 isn't red, but perhaps Mn compounds can be red. Hmm, not too sure.

Wait, another approach: reaction 3 produces F and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. Let me think of a reaction where a salt (C) hydrolyzes to give two acids. Maybe C is sodium nitrate? No, because when sodium nitrate hydrolyzes, it gives nitric acid (strong) and sodium hydroxide (strong base). But in the problem, two acids are produced, so perhaps C is a sulfite or another polyatomic ion.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, and upon hydrolysis, it gives nitric acid and another acid. But I'm not recalling exactly.

Wait, maybe C is ammonium nitrate. If it reacts with water, it might decompose, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Another angle: reaction 4, D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. So D and B are gases. What gases react in 1:1 to form a solvent.

Possible solvents: H2O, ethanol, etc. If D and B are gases, like maybe H2O and something else. Wait, for example
