Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to get product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to make product 4. The question is about how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I know that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When it's treated with bromine, which is Br2, I think about the possible reactions. Bromine can undergo various additions, like in alkenes, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait! Wait, I'm mixing things up. Adding bromine to a ketone... Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, but without any alpha hydrogens? Wait, no, cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) with hydrogens. Oh wait, so I think the reaction is the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, another thought: when a ketone is treated with bromine, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enol formation or maybe a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienophile, but that's for dienes. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a haloform reaction? No, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone is treated with excess halogen, but cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another reaction comes to mind: the addition of HBr to the ketone. But wait, adding HBr to a ketone would give a bromoalkane, but wait, no, HBr is added in acid conditions. Wait, but bromine is Br2; could it be that it's undergoing a different kind of addition?

Wait, another thought: the addition of Br2 to a ketone. Wait, maybe
