Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the radius of the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases because you're closer to the star. Wait, no, wait. No, if parallax is small, the distance is large. Because a more distant star would have a smaller parallax. Oh right, because the closer the star, the larger the parallax. So plx is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

So the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 ) is d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right! So it's the differential: how does N change as r (the distance) changes. So we're looking for dN/dr.

So N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dr equals 5*d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Because d here is the same as r, the distance.

Wait, let me double-check. If N = k * d^5, then dN/d d = 5k d^4. So for small changes in d, the number of stars increases by 5k d^4 per parsec (or whatever unit). So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Let me think again. The number of stars N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, but since plx is 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So N = A * d^5, where A is some constant. So the derivative dN/dr is 5A d^4. So the rate of change is 5A d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C.

Another way to think about it: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume element. But wait, wait, that's another approach. Let me think. The density of stars might be considered as a function, but in this problem, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So perhaps that approach is not necessary here. But let's see.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a small range of distance dr could be found by considering the volume. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. If the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume multiplied by some density. But I'm not sure if that's the right way here. Because the given relation is already N vs parallax, which directly gives the relation to distance.

So sticking with the initial approach, the answer is option C.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This requires calculating the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Since \( d \) is equivalent to \( r \), the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the rate of change is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
