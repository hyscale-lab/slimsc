Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds and asks how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D with different numbers. Let's break each compound down.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: I remember that for a compound to be optically active, it needs to have a chiral center, which means it must have four different substituents on a carbon. But wait, this is an alkene with a Z configuration. So, the molecule's structure is important here. The molecule is (Z), so the higher priority groups are on the same side. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl. So, the structure is Cl2-C=CH-CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it. 

Wait, butene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4 are single bonds. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second, which has a methyl. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's substituted with Cl and methyl.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group. So C1: Cl and double bond to C2. C2: CH(CH
