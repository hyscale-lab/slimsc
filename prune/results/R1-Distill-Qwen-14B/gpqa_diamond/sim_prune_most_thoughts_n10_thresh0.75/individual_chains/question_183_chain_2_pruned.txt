Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. I need to visualize its structure first. Let me think. Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. The numbering starts with the carboxylic acid group. So position 1 is the COOH group.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, right, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Let me draw this out mentally.

So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond. The "cyclohex-3-ene" part means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at 2 (formyl group), 5 (vinyl group), and 1 (carboxylic acid group). Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Wait, the parent chain is cyclohexene, so the substituents are attached at certain positions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The main ring is cyclohexene with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, the substituents are attached to the ring at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and 1 (carboxylic acid). Or perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1 because it's the functional group that gets the lowest number.

Wait, no. In IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering starts at the end nearest to the functional group with the highest priority. Carboxylic acid has higher priority than aldehyde or alkenes. So the carboxylic acid group is at position 1. Then, moving around the ring, position 2 is the formyl group, position 3 is part of the double bond (so between 3 and 4), and position 5 is the vinyl group.

Wait, but cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would have the carboxylic acid
