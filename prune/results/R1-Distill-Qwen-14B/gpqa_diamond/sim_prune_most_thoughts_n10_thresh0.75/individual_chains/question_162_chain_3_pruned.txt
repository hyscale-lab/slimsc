Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric, but I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but maybe this metric is representing part of it.

Wait, I remember that in general, the area of a sphere in 2D would just be the circumference, but I'm dealing with a pseudosphere here. Oh wait, wait—pseudosphere is a term more commonly used in hyperbolic geometry, but in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere might refer to a surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I need to compute the area using this metric. The metric is given in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional space.

Wait, in 2D, the area would just be the integral over the surface. But this metric is given in 2D variables, x and y. So perhaps the entire space is 2-dimensional.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me write that as ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (
