Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are provided, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, all right, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized. The formula is E_n = (n²) * E, since E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy for n=1.

But wait, these are four identical fermions, right? Because they're spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So each particle must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, and the spin. Since the particles are spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each energy level n, there are two possible states (spin up and spin down) available to the particles.

Now, since we have four particles, we need to fill them into the available energy levels following the Pauli exclusion. Each energy level can hold two particles (due to spin), so I need to figure out how to arrange four particles into these levels.

Wait, but the question is about the system's energy. So the total energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. So I need to figure out the states each particle is in, then add up their energies.

But in the ground state, the lowest possible energy configuration would have the particles in the lowest possible energy levels, with each taking a unique state. Let me think about the filling order.

In the ground state, the first two particles would be in n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two in n=2, each with opposite spins. So four particles in total.

Wait, but wait, n=1 can hold two particles (since two
