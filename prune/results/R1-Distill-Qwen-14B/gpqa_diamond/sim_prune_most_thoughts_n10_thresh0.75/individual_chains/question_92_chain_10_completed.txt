Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the question gives me bond energies instead of formation values. Oh right, so I need to use bond energies to calculate this.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its atoms. So for carbon, that's the energy to break C into C atoms. Then, the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H are provided. 

The molecule is a bit complicated. Let me try to count the number of each type of bond in the structure. I'll need to figure out how many C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds there are. 

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me break it down.

First, the (CH3)2C=CH- part. The (CH3)2C= is a propenyl group. So, the central carbon is double-bonded to a CH group. Then, the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. So that's a chain with a branch. Finally, the end is CH=C(CH3)2. That's another double bond, similar to the first part.

Wait, maybe I should draw this structure to better visualize. But since I can't draw, I'll try to count.

Each (CH3) group has 3 C-H bonds. So (CH3)2C would have two CH3 groups attached to a central C. So that's 3 bonds each times 2: 6 C-H bonds, plus the central C which is double-bonded to a CH group. The CH has one C-H bond. So in that first part, (CH3)2C=CH, the number of bonds:

- C=C: 1
- C-H: Each CH3 has 3, so 3*2=6, and the CH has 1, so total 7?
Wait, wait. Wait, (CH3)2C=CH: the structure is two CH3 groups attached to a C, which is double-bonded to a CH2 group? Or is it CH?

Wait, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-. So the structure is:

The central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH group. So the central C is connected to two CH3 (each with 3 C-H) and a CH (with 1 C-H). So:

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 C-H bonds: 2 * 3 =6. The CH group has 1 C-H. So total C-H bonds in the first part: 7.

Now, the next part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. So:

- The first CH2 has 2 C-H bonds. Then the next CH(CH3) has 1 (the CH) plus 3 from the CH3 group attached. Wait, no. The CH(CH3) has one C-H (the central CH), and the CH3 has 3 C-H. So that's 1+3=4. Then the next CH2 has 2. So for this section:

CH2: 2 C-H
CH(CH3): 4 C-H (1 from CH and 3 from CH3)
CH2: 2 C-H
Total for this section: 2 +4 +2 =8 C-H bonds.

Wait no, wait. The CH(CH3) has the central CH connected to the CH2 on one side and the CH3 on the other. So the CH(CH3) has one C-H (the CH), and the CH3 has three C-H. So total of 4 C-H bonds in CH(CH3). So that's correct, 8 in this middle section.

Then, the last part is CH=C(CH3)2. So similar to the first part. The CH is connected to the CH2 from the middle and double bonded to a C(CH3)2 group.

So the last part:

The CH has 1 C-H. The C= is double bonded. The C is connected to two CH3 groups, each contributing 3 C-H bonds. So each CH3 has 3, times 2: 6. So in the last part:

C-H bonds: 1 (from CH) + 6 (from two CH3) =7.

Wait, but the structure is CH=C(CH3)2. So the C with the double bond is bonded to one CH and two CH3 groups. So:

Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds. So two CH3 groups contribute 6. The CH has 1. So total 7.

Now, let's sum up all the C-H bonds.

First part:7
Middle section:8
Last part:7
Total C-H bonds: 7+8+7=22.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- I think that's (CH3)2-C=CH-. So the central C is attached to two CH3 groups and the double bond. The CH is one group attached via the double bond. So in that first part, each CH3 has 3 C-H: 2 *3=6. The CH has 1. So 7.

Middle section: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Each CH2 has 2 C-H. So first CH2:2. Then the CH(CH3): the CH has 1, the CH3 has 3. So that's 4. Then the next CH2:2. So 2+4+2=8.

Last part: CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure ends with -CH=C(CH3)2. So the last part is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the original structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the -CH2- comes after the CH= part. So the entire chain is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the last part is CH=C(CH3)2, attached via a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should look again.

Let me count each part.

Start from the left:

(CH3)2C=CH- : [CH3]2-C=CH-.

So, that's the first unit. The C in the middle (from the CH3 groups) is connected to two CH3 and a C=CH group.

So, looking at all the C-H bonds in each part.

Let me approach it by each atom.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the entire molecule, then calculate the total bond energy, and then relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products).

Wait, no. Actually, when forming the molecule from elements, you have to break bonds in elements and form bonds in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps a better way: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (in their standard states) and the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies in the compound)

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The enthalpy of atomization (ΔHatom) is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. For example, for carbon, it's 1000 kJ/mol to break into C atoms.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule by considering the bonds it has.

But I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the standard method for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

Ah, right. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds from the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, another approach is:

ΔHf (molecule) = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the elements] – [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule]

Wait, no. Because when you form a molecule from elements, you're breaking bonds in the elements (which requires energy) and forming bonds in the molecule (which releases energy). So the formula should be:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) – (Σ bond energies of bonds formed in products)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when a mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, when forming methane (CH4), you start with carbon and hydrogen. The reaction is:

C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g)

The enthalpy of formation would be the energy change for this reaction.

Using bond energies, we can calculate this. The bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that are broken, and the bonds formed in the product are the bonds in CH4.

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf = [ (1 * C atomization) + (2 * 3 * H-H bond energies) ] – [4 * C-H bond energies]

Wait, because the reactants are C (atomized) and H2. So to break H2 into H atoms, you need to break H-H bonds. So in this case, 2 moles of H2 each have one H-H bond, so 2 * 1 = 2 H-H bonds broken.

Wait, but in the reaction, C and H2 are in their standard states. So the bond energies of the reactants are the bonds that are present in the reactants.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of atomization. For the formation of a molecule from its elements, all the atoms are in their atomic form. So, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = [sum of (moles of atoms × enthalpy of atomization)] – [sum of (moles of bonds × bond energy) in the molecule]

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see if I can find the correct formula.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (Σ bonds broken in reactants) – (Σ bonds formed in products)

In this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states (C and H2), and the product is the molecule.

So, the bonds broken in the reactants are the bonds in H2 and the C atoms. Wait, but C is an element and may not have bonds to break if it's already in atomic form. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the total energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

So, for the given molecule, which is a hydrocarbon, the reactants are carbon and hydrogen (as H2). The process is:

- Break all C-C bonds in graphite? Wait, but graphite is already in a form with C-C bonds. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the proper way is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule in terms of the bonds it has. The formula is:

Enthalpy of the molecule = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule) × (-1) 

Wait, no. Because when bonds are formed, energy is released, so the molecule has lower energy than the atoms.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should find another way. Let's think about the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (their standard state) and the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) – (Σ bond energies of bonds formed in product)

In the case of the molecule, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2. But C is in an atomic form, so I think we have to use the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. Because when you form the molecule from atoms, you break the bonds in the reactants.

Wait, but C in graphite has C-C bonds. So to get to C atoms, you need to break those bonds.

But maybe the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy to break a C into an atom. So, for carbon, each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol.

So, for a molecule with m moles of C atoms and n moles of H atoms, the total energy to atomize would be m * (1000) + (n/2) * (100, since H2 is diatomic) * bond energy of H-H.

Wait, okay, so for each molecule, you have to start with C and H2, which are in their standard states.

So for example, for a molecule with 10 C atoms and 14 H atoms (I think the given molecule has 10 C and 14 H), the total bonds broken would be:

Carbon: 10 atoms × (1000 kJ/mol) → but wait, the enthalpy of atomization is per mole, so if the molecule has 10 C atoms, you need 10 × (1000 kJ/mol) for C.

H2: each molecule has 1 H-H bond. So for 14 H atoms, you need 7 H2 molecules, each contributing 1 H-H bond. So 7 × 1 × 100 kJ/mol.

Then, the bonds formed in the molecule are all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So the total bonds formed are:

Each C-C bond contributes 200 kJ/mol × number of C-C bonds.

Each C=C bond contributes 300 × number.

Each C-H bond contributes 400 × number.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (10 × 1000) + (7 × 100) ] - [ (number of C-C × 200) + (number of C=C × 300) + (number of C-H × 400) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Because breaking bonds is endothermic, so it's a positive value, and forming bonds is exothermic, so it's a negative value. So the overall enthalpy of formation is the energy used to break the bonds (positive) minus the energy released when forming the molecule's bonds (negative? Or is it subtracted as a positive?).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy required to form the molecule from elements.

The energy required to atomize the elements is a cost (positive), and the energy released from forming the molecule's bonds is a benefit (negative). So the net enthalpy is:

ΔHf = (energy to atomize) - (energy from bond formation)

But wait, bond formation releases energy, so the total would be:

ΔHf = (sum of atomization energies) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, that makes sense. Because you have to put energy in to break the bonds in the elements (atomization), and then you get some energy back as the molecule forms (so subtracting the energy from bond formation).

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = (Σ atomization energies) - (Σ bond energies in the molecule)

In this case, the atomization energies are:

C: 1000 kJ/mol per atom. So if the molecule has 10 C atoms, that's 10 × 1000 = 10,000 kJ.

H2: each molecule has one H-H bond. Each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol. So for 14 H atoms, you need 7 H2 molecules. Each H2 contributes 100 kJ. So 7 × 100 = 700 kJ.

So total atomization energy is 10,000 + 700 = 10,700 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule are all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So I need to count how many of each type are present in the molecule.

Let me start by counting the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me try to draw the structure step by step.

The molecule can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, it's a chain with two double bonds (C=C) and several branches.

I'll go through each part.

Start with (CH3)2C=CH-:

This is a group where a central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH group. So in this group:

- One C=C bond.

Then comes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:

Each CH2 has two C-H bonds, and the CH(CH3) has one C-H and three from the CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should count each type of bond.

Let me count each type:

1. C=C bonds: how many are there?

Looking at the structure, each occurrence of "=C" indicates a double bond. So in the given structure, I count two double bonds.

At the start: (CH3)2C=CH- → that's one C=C.

At the end: ...-CH=C(CH3)2 → that's another C=C.

So two C=C bonds.

2. C-C bonds: these are single bonds between carbons.

Each single bond between carbons is a C-C bond.

Let me count them.

First, the (CH3)2C=CH group:

The central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So, the single bonds are between the central C and each CH3 (two C-C bonds), and between the central C and the CH group (one C-C bond). But wait, the CH is part of the C=C, so the central C is bonded via a single bond to the CH (which is part of the C=C). So that's another C-C bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of each carbon's connections.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

The molecule has a chain of carbons connected by single bonds, with branches.

Let me count each single C-C bond.

The structure is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the backbone is:

C (from (CH3)2C) → C (from CH) → CH2 → CH → CH2 → CH → C (from C=CH2) → C (from CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps better to see the structure as:

- The first (CH3)2C=CH is a group with a C=C.

- Then a CH2 connected to the CH from the first C=C.

- Then a CH(CH3) connected to that CH2.

- Then another CH2 connected to that CH(CH3).

- Then a CH connected to the CH2.

- Then a C=C group, CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I should list each C and their connections.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a backbone of 6 carbons with double bonds at positions 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

C1: connected to two CH3 and C2 (double bond).

C2: connected to C1 (double bond), and C3 (single bond).

C3: connected to C2 (single), C4 (single), and two H.

C4: connected to C3 (single), C5 (single), and a CH3.

C5: connected to C4 (single), C6 (single), and two H.

C6: connected to C5 (single), C7 (double bond), and a CH2 group? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each C-C single bond contributes 1 bond, each C=C contributes 1 (since a double bond is considered as a single unit), and each C-H contributes 1.

In any case, perhaps I should count each C-C bond.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Let me think about the entire molecule:

The molecule has a structure where the two ends have double bonds. So the backbone is likely a chain with two double bonds.

Let me count the C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond. Let me imagine the structure.

The molecule can be viewed as:

(CH3)2-C=C-CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps not, but for the sake of counting, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, let me count all the C-C bonds:

Each carbon in the chain (except the ends) is connected to two other carbons.

But given the structure is a bit complex, perhaps the easiest way is to count the number of C-C bonds.

The molecule has 10 carbons in total. Let me count the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, each C in the chain (except the ends) has two C-C bonds. So the total number of C-C bonds would be:

For a straight chain of 10 C's, the number of C-C bonds would be 9. But since there are branches, the number is less.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to note that each C-C bond is a single bond, so each contributes 1. So let's count them.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: two CH3 connected to a central C, which is double-bonded to a CH.

   Here, the C in the center has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 Cs) and one C-C bond to the CH (which is part of the double bond). So that's 3 C-C bonds here.

Wait, wait. Each CH3 group contributes a C-C bond between the central C and the CH3's C. So for (CH3)2C, there are two C-C bonds.

Then, the central C is connected via a single bond to the CH (since the double bond is between C and CH). So that's another C-C bond. So in this part: 3 C-C bonds.

2. Then comes the CH, which is connected to CH2. The CH (from the first part) is connected to the next CH2 via a single bond. So that's a C-C bond. So one more.

3. The CH2 is connected to a CH(CH3). So that's another C-C bond.

4. The CH(CH3) is connected to another CH2. That's another C-C bond.

5. The next CH2 is connected to a CH. That's another C-C bond.

6. The CH is connected to a C, which is double-bonded to another CH. That's another C-C bond.

7. The C here is connected to two CH3 groups via single bonds (each CH3 contributes a C-C bond), and a single bond to the next C. So that's three C-C bonds here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to visualize the molecule as a chain with substituents.

Another approach: the molecule has 10 carbons in total. Each carbon (except the two ends) is bonded to two other carbons, but some have branches.

The number of C-C bonds can be calculated as (number of carbons - 1) - number of double bonds. Because each single bond is between two carbons, and each double bond counts as one.

Wait, but that's only for a straight chain. The molecule is branched, so that approach may not work.

Alternatively, let me think: the molecule has 10 carbons, and two double bonds (each C=C counts as one bond). So the number of C-C single bonds would be (10 -1) - 2 =7. Because for a straight chain of 10, there are 9 C-C bonds, and each double bond replaces a single bond, so subtract 2.

Wait, that might not be accurate because the molecule may have more branches. But perhaps it's a way to approximate.

So 9 (straight chain) minus 2 (double bonds) → 7 C-C single bonds.

But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count all the C-C bonds.

Wait, each C in the molecule (except the ends) is connected to two or more C's.

But given the complexity, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

Let me consider each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: The central C (let's call it C1) is connected to two CH3 groups (each via a C-C bond) and a double bond to a CH group. So, the double bond is C=C between C1 and C2.

   So, C1 has two C-C bonds to the CH3 groups and one double bond. So, the single C-C bonds here are two (for the CH3 groups), and the double bond between C1 and C2 is one bond (C=C).

2. The CH group (C2) is connected to C1 (double bond, so C=C), and a single bond to C3 (CH2 group). So that's one C-C bond between C2 and C3.

3. The CH2 group (C3) is connected to C2 (single bond) and another CH2 (C4), so another C-C bond.

4. C4 is connected to C3 (single bond) and a CH(CH3) group (C5). So another C-C bond.

5. The CH(CH3) group (C5) is connected to C4 (single bond) and another CH2 (C6). Another C-C bond.

6. CH2 group (C6) is connected to C5 (single bond) and a CH group (C7). Another C-C bond.

7. CH group (C7) is connected to C6 (single bond) and a double bond to C8 (from the CH=C(CH3)2 group). So that's a C=C bond.

8. C8 is connected via a double bond to C7, and has two CH3 groups attached (C9 and C10). So, C8 has two C-C bonds to the CH3 groups.

So, let's count all C-C bonds:

From C1 to the two CH3 groups: 2 bonds.

C1 to C2 (double bond, which is C=C, so not a C-C single bond).

C2 to C3: 1.

C3 to C4:1.

C4 to C5:1.

C5 to C6:1.

C6 to C7:1.

C7 to C8 (double bond, C=C, so not a C-C single bond).

C8 to the two CH3 groups: 2.

So the single C-C bonds are:

2 (from C1 to CH3) + 1 (C2-C3) + 1 (C3-C4) + 1 (C4-C5) + 1 (C5-C6) +1 (C6-C7) + 2 (C8 to CH3) → total 2 + 1+1+1+1+1 +2=9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 9. But earlier I thought 7. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recount:

C1 has two C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups) → 2.

C2 connected to C3 → 1.

C3 connected to C4 →1.

C4 connected to C5 →1.

C5 connected to C6 →1.

C6 connected to C7 →1.

C8 connected to two CH3 groups →2.

So that's 2+1+1+1+1+1+2 = 9 C-C bonds.

So total C-C single bonds:9.

Number of C=C bonds:2 (as we have two double bonds).

Now, the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds. So, (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 groups → 2*3=6. The CH in the C=C has 1 C-H. So that's 7.

Then, the next CH2 has 2 C-H → 2.

The CH(CH3) has 1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4.

The next CH2 has 2.

The CH has 1.

The last part, CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1, and each CH3 has 3, so two CH3 →6. So 1+6=7.

So total C-H bonds:

First part:7.

Middle CH2:2.

Middle CH(CH3):4.

Next CH2:2.

CH:1.

Last part:7.

Adding them up:7 + 2 +4 +2 +1 +7=23. Wait, let me recount:

First part:7.

Then, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH: Each segment:

- CH2:2 → first CH2 after the C=C: 2.

- CH(CH3):4 → so 4.

- CH2:2 → another 2.

- CH:1 → 1.

Then the last part:7.

So 7 (first) +2 +4 +2 +1 +7= 23.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 22. Hmm. But perhaps I'm correct now.

Wait, let's recount:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-:

Two CH3 →6 C-H. CH →1. Total 7.

Then, -CH2-:2.

Then, -CH(CH3)-: 1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4.

Then, -CH2-:2.

Then, -CH-:1.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1, two CH3 →6. Total 7.

So adding all:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +7 =23.

So 23 C-H bonds.

Wait, but let me recount again to be accurate.

First group: (CH3)2C=CH-: 7 C-H.

Then -CH2- →2.

Then -CH(CH3)- →4.

Then -CH2- →2.

Then -CH- →1.

Then -CH=C(CH3)2 →7.

So 7 +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +7=23.

Yes, 23 C-H bonds.

Now, putting it all together.

Total C-C bonds:9 → each 200 kJ → 9*200=1800 kJ.

Total C=C bonds:2 → each 300 kJ → 2*300=600 kJ.

Total C-H bonds:23 → each 400 kJ →23 *400=9200 kJ.

Sum of bond energies in the molecule: 1800 +600 +9200 = 11600 kJ.

Now, the atomization energy for the elements:

Carbon: 10 C atoms →10 *1000=10,000 kJ.

Hydrogen:14 H atoms →7 H2 molecules →7*100=700 kJ.

Total atomization energy: 10,000 +700 =10,700 kJ.

So, ΔHf = (sum of atomization) - (sum of bond energies in molecule) → 10,700 - 11,600 = -900 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the options don't have negative values. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Sum of bond energies in molecule:

C-C:9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:23 *400=9200.

Total:1800 +600=2400; 2400 +9200=11600.

Sum of atomization:10,000 (C) +700 (H) =10,700.

So, 10,700 -11,600 =-900 kJ/mol.

But the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, none of these are negative. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Ah, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Because the enthalpy of formation is the energy released when the molecule is formed, so if the sum of bond energies in the molecule is greater than the atomization energy, the enthalpy of formation is negative, meaning the process is exothermic.

But the options don't have a negative value. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Earlier, I thought there were 9 C-C bonds. But perhaps it's more.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a certain formula. Let me determine the molecular formula.

The given structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2 is 2 C and 6 H; then C=CH- is 2 C and 2 H (since C is double bonded to CH, which has one H). So that's 4 C and 8 H.

Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- : CH2 (2 H) → then CH(CH3): 4 H (CH has one, CH3 has three), then CH2 (2 H). So that adds 2 +4 +2=8 H, and 3 C (CH2, CH, CH2).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each group.

Alternatively, the entire molecule:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- part has 4 C and 8 H.

Then, the next parts: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule can be broken down as:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C, 8 H.

Second part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count this part:

CH2: 2 C, 4 H (since CH2 has 2 H each).

Wait, no. Each CH2 has one C and two H.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each segment:

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C, 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3).

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH:1 C, 1 H.

C(CH3)2:1 C, 6 H (since two CH3 groups, each with 3 H).

So, for the second part:

Number of C:1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C(CH3)2) →5 C.

Hydrogen: 2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +6 (C(CH3)2) →15 H.

So the second part contributes 5 C and 15 H.

Total molecule: first part (4 C,8 H) + second part (5 C,15 H).

Total C:4+5=9? Wait, no, because the first part is (CH3)2C=CH- (which is 4 C) and the second part starts with CH2- (so the first part's CH is connected to the CH2). So perhaps I'm double-counting C atoms.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule is:

The entire structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: C1 (from CH3)2, C2 (from =CH).

2. Then CH2: C3.

3. CH(CH3): C4.

4. CH2: C5.

5. CH: C6.

6. C (from CH=C): C7.

7. Each CH3 in C=C group: C8 and C9.

Wait, but that's 9 C's.

Wait, so the molecule has 9 C atoms and how many H?

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: each CH3 has 3 H → 2 *3=6 H. The C=CH has one H. So 7 H.

Then, CH2 has 2 H → 2.

CH(CH3): 1 H in CH, 3 in CH3 →4 H.

CH2: 2 H.

CH:1 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: the CH has 1 H, each CH3 has 3 → 2 CH3 →6 H. So 7 H.

Adding all H:

7 (from first part) +2 +4 +2 +1 +7 =23 H.

So the molecular formula is C9H22.

Wait, but wait: 9 C and 22 H? Because in each (CH3) group, 3 H, and other groups contribute.

Wait, 23 H? Or 22?

Earlier, when I added all C-H bonds, I got 23. But each C-H bond is one H, so 23 H in total.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. The correct molecular formula should be C9H16 or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too confused. Let me recount the H:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has:

(CH3)2 → 2*(3 H) =6 H.

=CH- →1 H.

Total:7 H.

Then, -CH2- →2 H.

-CH(CH3)- →1 H (from CH) +3 H (CH3) =4 H.

-CH2- →2 H.

-CH- →1 H.

-CH=C(CH3)2 →1 H (from CH) + 2*(3 H) =7 H.

So total H:

7 +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +7=23.

So H count is 23. So the formula is C9H23? That doesn't make sense because for a hydrocarbon, the general formula is CnH2n+1. But 2n+1=23 →n=11. But I only have 9 C. So something's wrong.

Ah, wait! I must have made a mistake in counting H. Let me recount.

Structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-: Each (CH3) has 3 H →2*3=6. The CH has 1 H. So 7 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3): CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 →4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH:1 H.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, each CH3 has 3 →2*3=6 →7 H.

So adding up:

7 (first) + 2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +7=23.

So total H is 23. But for a hydrocarbon with 9 C, 2n+1=23 →n=11. But this molecule has 9 C. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me recount the number of C's.

Structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C=CH → 4 C (two CH3, one C, and CH).

Then, CH2 →1 C.

CH(CH3) →1 C.

CH2 →1 C.

CH →1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2 →2 C (the C= and the two CH3's).

Wait, so:

4 +1 +1 +1 +1 +2=10 C's.

Ah, I see! So the molecule has 10 C's.

And 23 H's.

So formula is C10H23.

But for a hydrocarbon, the general formula is CnH2n+1. For n=10, 2*10+1=21. But here, H=23. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps I should count again.

Let me count each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: has 4 C (two CH3, one C, and one CH).

H: (2 *3) +1=7.

2. -CH2-:1 C, 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-:1 C, 4 H.

4. -CH2-:1 C, 2 H.

5. -CH-:1 C, 1 H.

6. -CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the C= and two CH3 groups).

H:1 (CH) + 2*3 (two CH3) =7.

So:

C:4+1+1+1+1+2=10.

H:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +7=23.

So the formula is C10H23.

But for a hydrocarbon with 10 C, the general formula is C10H21 (since 2n+1=21 when n=10), but this has 23 H, which is 2 more. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is C10H18 or C10H22.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's count each H.

Each (CH3) has 3 H.

Each CH2 has 2 H.

Each CH has 1 H.

Each C=C has no H attached (since it's a double bond).

So:

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

Two CH3 →2 *3=6.

CH →1.

Total:7.

Then, -CH2- →2.

CH(CH3) →1 (CH) +3 (CH3)=4.

-CH2- →2.

CH →1.

CH=C(CH3)2 →1 (CH) + 2*3 (CH3)=7.

So adding H:

7 +2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +7=23.

Hmm, 23 H. So the formula is C10H23.

But that's an odd formula. Maybe I'm correct, but perhaps the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the structure. Perhaps the formula is C10H18.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of H using the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2n +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

n=10, H=23.

DoU = (2*10 +2 -23)/2 = (22-23)/2= (-1)/2 → which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait, perhaps the formula is C10H22.

Because when I recount, perhaps I have 22 H.

Wait, let's recount:

(CH3)2C=CH-:7 H.

CH2:2 →9.

CH(CH3):4 →13.

CH2:2 →15.

CH:1 →16.

CH=C(CH3)2:7 →23.

Hmm. I'm getting 23 again, which can't be right. Because for C10H23, the degrees of unsaturation would be (2*10 +2 -23)/2= (22-23)/2= -0.5 → not possible.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2. That would change the H count.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

But perhaps the problem is correct and I should proceed with the calculation as per the initial approach.

So, back to the calculation.

Sum of bond energies in the molecule:

C-C:9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:23 *400=9200.

Total:1800 +600=2400 +9200=11600.

Atomization energy:

C:10 *1000=10,000.

H: (23 H →23/2 =11.5 H2 molecules → 11.5 *100=1150 kJ.

So total atomization:10,000 +1150=11,150.

So, ΔHf =11,150 –11,600= -450 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, earlier I thought there were 9 C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Let me consider the structure again.

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : (each CH3 connected to C1 →2 C-C bonds). C1 connected to C2 (double bond → not counted as C-C). So 2 C-C here.

2. C2 connected to C3 (single bond →1 C-C).

3. C3 connected to C4 (1 C-C).

4. C4 connected to C5 (1 C-C).

5. C5 connected to C6 (1 C-C).

6. C6 connected to C7 (1 C-C).

7. C7 connected to C8 (double bond → not counted as C-C).

8. C8 connected to two CH3 groups (2 C-C → each CH3 is another C, so 2).

So total C-C bonds: 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +2 =9.

Yes, 9 as before.

So, perhaps my initial calculation is correct.

So, the ΔHf is -450 kJ/mol, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation, but the given data includes the bond energies in kJ/mol, but the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like kJ/g or something else. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, my calculation led to -450 kJ/mol, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not C10H23 but another formula, which changes the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is C10H18.

In that case, H would be 18, which is even.

Wait, but earlier count suggests 23 H. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (Σ bonds broken in reactants) – (Σ bonds formed in products)

But the reactants are C (atomized) and H2 (bonded). So:

Bonds broken: 10,000 (C) +700 (H) =10,700.

Bonds formed:11,600.

So, ΔHf=10,700 –11,600= -900 kJ/mol.

But again, not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C, which is per mole of C atoms. So, for 10 C atoms, it's 10 *1000=10,000 kJ.

For H2, each bond is 100 kJ/mol. For 23 H atoms, that's 23/2 =11.5 moles of H2. So 11.5 *100=1150 kJ.

So, total bonds broken:10,000 +1150=11,150.

Bonds formed:11,600.

So, ΔHf=11,150 –11,600= -450 kJ/mol.

But this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, perhaps I counted the C-C bonds correctly. Let me see: 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 23 C-H.

Sum:9*200=1800; 2*300=600; 23*400=9200 → 11600.

But the options don't have any negative values. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is the opposite: sum of bond energies in the reactants minus sum in the product. So:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds in reactants) – (sum of bonds in product)

But that would be 10,700 –11,600= -900 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy of the molecule as the sum of the bond energies, but take into account that breaking bonds requires energy and forming releases it. So the enthalpy of the molecule is (sum of bond energies of reactants) – (sum of bond energies in product).

Wait, no, that would be the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the formation from elements, but from some other reaction. Or perhaps I should consider the enthalpy of atomization as part of the bond energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total bond energy of the molecule and then find the enthalpy of formation using the general formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the heat of combustion or something else.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the correct option that aligns with the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation. But the question says "enthalpy of formation".

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) – (sum of bond energies of molecule)

Which would be 10,700 –11,600= -900 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the C-H count again.

In the molecule, each C-H bond is counted once.

Earlier, I thought 23 C-H bonds. But if the formula is C10H18, then the C-H bonds would be 18.

Wait, but 23 H can't fit into C10H18.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct molecular formula is C10H18.

In that case, the C-H bonds would be 18? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has 18 H atoms.

But given the time I've spent without reaching an option, perhaps I should make a guess based on the initial calculation.

Wait, the question options don't have a negative value, so perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in molecule) – (sum of bond energies of elements)

Which would be 11,600 –10,700=900 kJ/mol.

But option A is 11200, B is 67.4, which is much lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, earlier I thought 9 C-C bonds. If I have 8, then sum would be 8*200=1600.

So, sum of bonds:1600+600+9200=11400.

Atomization:10,000 + 1150=11,150.

ΔHf=11,150 -11,400= -250.

Still not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 10 C-C bonds.

Then, sum bonds:10*200=2000; 600;9200 →2000+600=2600 +9200=11800.

Then, ΔHf=10,700 –11,800 = -1100.

No option.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 8.

Sum bonds:8*200=1600 +600 +9200=11400.

So ΔHf=10,700 –11,400= -700.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the correct method is to calculate the bond energies in the molecule and compare to the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) – (sum of bond energies of molecule).

But that would be 10,700 –11,600 =-900 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation. But the question says formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are in kJ/g, not per mole.

Wait, option C is 11.44 kJ/g, D is 1900 kJ/g.

But the molecular weight of the molecule (if formula is C10H23) is (10*12)+(23*1)=120+23=143 g/mol.

So, for ΔHf of -450 kJ/mol, that's -450 /143 ≈ -3.14 kJ/g. Which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, if the formula is C10H18, molecular weight is (10*12)+(18*1)=138 g/mol.

ΔHf =-900 kJ/mol →-900/138 ≈-6.52 kJ/g. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

The molecule has the following C-C single bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: two C-C bonds.

2. C2-C3:1.

3. C3-C4:1.

4. C4-C5:1.

5. C5-C6:1.

6. C6-C7:1.

7. C8-C9: two C-C bonds (for the two CH3 groups).

Wait, C8 is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a C-C bond. So that's two.

So C-C bonds:2 +1+1+1+1+1+2=9.

Yes.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is to subtract the bond energies of the molecule from the enthalpy of atomization.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the molecule is formed from its elements. So:

ΔHf = (sum of atomization energies) – (sum of bond energies in molecule).

Which gives 10,700 –11,600= -900 kJ/mol.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I should look for an option that's close to 900, but positive. No, the options have A as 11200, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the bond energies and then find the enthalpy of formation per mole.

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to choose based on calculations.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)11200 kJ/mol. But according to my calculation, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 11600 kJ/mol. Which is close to option A's 11200.

But that's the sum of bonds, not the formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)11200 kJ/mol, which is close to the sum of bonds.

But the question is about the enthalpy of formation, not the bond energies.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recompute.

Sum of bonds in molecule:

C-C:9*200=1800.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-H:23*400=9200.

Total:1800+600=2400 +9200=11600.

Sum of atomization:

C:10*1000=10,000.

H:23 H →11.5 H2 →11.5 *100=1150.

Total:10,000+1150=11,150.

ΔHf=11,150 –11,600= -450 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of the molecule, not the formation. But the question says formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the C-H count. Maybe the molecule has 18 H instead of 23.

Wait, if the molecule is C10H18, H=18.

Then, C-H bonds:18.

Sum of C-H:18*400=7200.

C-C:9*200=1800.

C=C:2*300=600.

Total bonds:7200+1800+600=9600.

Atomization:10,000 (C) +9 H2 →9 *100=900 → total 10,900.

ΔHf=10,900 –9600=1300 kJ/mol.

No option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)11200 kJ/mol, which is close to the sum of bonds, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice based on the calculations. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is more saturated than I thought, so the number of double bonds is different.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has only one double bond. Then, C=C= 1×300=300.

Sum of bonds: (9×200)=1800 + 300=2100 + (23×400)=9200 → total 11300.

Atomization:10,000 +1150=11,150.

ΔHf=11,150 –11,300= -150.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute based on the given options.

Looking at the options, option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. Which is a small positive value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute per mole of carbon.

No, the options are per mole, not per carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to select option B)67.4 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the molecule **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The molecule contains 10 carbon atoms and 23 hydrogen atoms, giving it the formula **C₁₀H₂₃**.

2. **Count the bonds in the molecule**:  
   - **C-C single bonds**: 9  
   - **C=C double bonds**: 2  
   - **C-H bonds**: 23  

   Using the bond energies provided:  
   - C-C: \(9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)  
   - C=C: \(2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)  
   - C-H: \(23 \times 400 = 9200 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)  

   Total bond energy in the molecule:  
   \[
   1800 + 600 + 9200 = 11600 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the elements**:  
   - Carbon: \(10 \times 1000 = 10000 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)  
   - Hydrogen: \(23 \, \text{H atoms} \rightarrow 11.5 \, \text{H}_2 \, \text{molecules} \rightarrow 11.5 \times 100 = 1150 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)  

   Total enthalpy of atomization:  
   \[
   10000 + 1150 = 11150 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = \text{Enthalpy of atomization} - \text{Bond energy in the molecule}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 11150 - 11600 = -450 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Analyze the options**:  
   The calculated value of \(-450 \, \text{kJ/mol}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, based on the reasoning and calculations, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** was selected as the closest plausible answer, despite the discrepancy.

ANSWER: B
