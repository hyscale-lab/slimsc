Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so its structure is like a diamond lattice. The molecule 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or substitution. Since it's dibromide and KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, elimination usually needs a good leaving group and a base. But since it's dibromide, perhaps it's a double elimination. Oh, wait, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkyne. But wait, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent positions in adamantane? Hmm, adamantane's structure has each carbon connected to three others. So maybe the positions are across each other, but in any case, the reaction with KOH likely forms an alkyne.

Wait, if you have two vicinal bromides, they could lose two HX molecules to form an alkyne. But wait, 1,3-d
