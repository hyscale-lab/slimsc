Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed from a reaction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let's visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. 

Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid: the carboxylic acid group is at position 3? No, wait, no. Wait, the formula is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring is cyclohexene, double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1 (since it's numbered starting from the carboxylic acid). Or maybe I should sketch this.

Wait, no, let me think again. The structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 2 (formyl group, which is CHO) and another substituent at position 5 (vinyl group, which is CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the ring is 6-membered, with a double bond between 3 and 4 (cyclohex-3-ene). The carboxylic acid is attached at position 1? Or maybe position 3? Wait, no. The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 3, but wait, cyclohexane is numbered such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the main chain. The main group is the cyclohexene ring. Attached to that ring are two substituents: a formyl group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5. And the ring is cyclohex-3-ene, meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the carboxylic acid group is at position 3? Wait, no, the name is
