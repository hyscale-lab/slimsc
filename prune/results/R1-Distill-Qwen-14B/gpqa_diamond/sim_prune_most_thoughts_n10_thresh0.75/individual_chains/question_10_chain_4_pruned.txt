Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. Let's see, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. Since all these are planets, their volumes would depend on their radius. Oh wait, Earth's radius is given in option a, and other options talk about masses relative to Earth. So maybe I need to figure out the mass and radius for each option and then compute the density.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, that's straightforward. Earth's density is known. Let me recall Earth's density. I think it's about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but Earth's average density is indeed around 5.5, so this planet's density would be 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the question says that the planet has a density of 5.5. So, in this case, the density is given, so it's 5.5. But wait, is that correct? Because the question is about which has the highest density, so if another option has a higher density, that's the answer. But I need to check all options.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Same composition as Earth implies that the density would be the same as Earth's, right? Because if the composition is same, density should be same. Because density depends on the materials it's made of. So if it's 5x mass but same density, then its radius would be larger. Because mass increases with radius cubed. Let me see: mass is density times volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³. So, if density is same, mass is proportional to r³. So if it's 5 times mass, the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But the density would still be 5.5 g/cm³. So the density is same as Earth.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition, so same density. So, the density would still be 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but option b says the planet has a density of 5.5 g/cm³. So all options a, c, d have the same density as Earth, which is 5.5. But wait, option a is Earth-mass and Earth-radius, so definitely density is 5.5. Option b has 2 Earth masses but same density? Or is the density given as 5.5? Let me re-read the question.

Wait the question says: which has the highest density. So let's re-examine each option.

Option a: Earth's mass and radius, so density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So that's a planet that's twice as massive as Earth, but same density. So, what
