Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a star with some specific parameters and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, okay, I remember that when stars have spots, it changes their effective temperature, which in turn affects the ionization state of elements in their atmosphere.

So, let me jot down the given data. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait a second, stars with spots are cooler in the spotted regions, right? But how does that affect the overall Teff? Oh, right, the effective temperature is a sort of average based on the total luminosity. So when a part of the surface is cooler, the star's overall Teff decreases.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when there are spots versus when there aren't. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Wait, 1448 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet range. I think that's around the Lyman series or maybe the transition for Ti lines. But not sure if that's relevant here.

The key here is the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a thermal equilibrium (LTE). The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
- n1 is the number in level 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

The ratio we're looking at is (n2/n1). The problem says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, with spots, T is lower (since Teff is 5500 K vs. 6000 K without spots). Since the ratio depends exponentially on temperature, the ratio will decrease when T decreases.

Wait, but why? Let me think. The energy difference (E2-E1) is positive, so as T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. So exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases as T decreases. So n2/n1 would go down. So without spots, the ratio is higher, which matches the given observation.

So the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same in both cases (since they're properties of the energy levels and don't change), the ratio simplifies to:

Factor = [exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*5500))]^{-1}

Wait, no, let me get that straight. The ratio when no spots is R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*Teff1)), and with spots, R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*Teff2)).

So the ratio R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k*Teff1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k*Teff2))] ) = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/Teff2 - 1/Teff1) ) ]

Wait, that's correct? Let me re-calculate. Let me factor the exponents:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
So R1 / R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )
= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, because (-a + b) = (b - a). So yeah, exponent is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Wait, but since T2 < T1, (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive, so the exponent is positive. So R1/R2 is greater than 1, which makes sense because R1 is larger than R2.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (R1/R2) = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ]

Now, I need to find ΔE. Alternatively, I can find the energy difference using the wavelength of the transition. Because, the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon's energy when transitioning. The energy of a photon with wavelength λ is given by E = hc/λ.

So, ΔE = hc/λ.

Given λ is approximately 1448 Å. Let me convert that to meters: 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J.s.
c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, we need this in terms of Kelvin to plug into the Boltzmann equation. Let me compute it in eV, perhaps, and then convert.

Wait, another approach: use the relation E = k*T, so the energy in terms of temperature. Let me compute E in Kelvin units.

But wait, actually, let's compute the exponent in terms of the temperature.

The exponent is (ΔE)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) first.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Subtract: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151

So 1.515e-5 K^-1.

Now, ΔE can be found from hc/λ.

Wait, but let's compute E in terms of k. So E = hc/(λ k), which gives E in terms of k*T.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula (hc)/(λ k) = (hc)/(λ k).

Wait, but I think I can compute (ΔE)/(k) = (hc)/(λ k). Let me compute that.

So,

(h c) / (λ k) = (6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448e-7) * (1.38e-23) ) = approximately 2.00e-30 J·m/K.

So (h c)/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.00e-30) ) = (approx) 1e5. Wait, 1.9878 / 2 is about 0.99, so approximately 0.99e5 = 99000.

Wait, that can't be right because hc/(λ k) would be in units of K. Let me check the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate step by step.

Calculate each part:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s ≈ 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

Compute numerator: h * c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: λ * k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448e-7) * (1.38e-23) = let's compute 1.448 * 1.38 = ~1.986, and exponents: 10^-7 * 10^-23 =10^-30. So denominator is 1.986e-30 J·m/K.

So (h c)/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.986e-30) ) = approx (1e5) * (1.9878 / 1.986) ) ≈ 1e5 * 1.0009 ≈ 100,090 K.

Wait, that gives (h c)/(λ k) ≈ 1e5 K. So that means the energy difference ΔE is hc/λ, which is equal to k * 1e5 K. So (ΔE)/(k) = 1e5 K.

Wait, that makes sense because the wavelength of 1448 Å is in the UV, which corresponds to higher energy compared to optical.

So putting it back into the exponent:

Exponent = (1e5 K) * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) )

We already calculated (1/5500 - 1/6000) as 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So Exponent = (1e5) * (1.515e-5) ) = approximately 1.515.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So factor = exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

What's e^1.515? Let me recall that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Wait, let me compute e^1.515.

We can approximate:

e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^0.015 = approximately 1.0151.

So e^1.515 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.547.

So about 4.55.

Wait, that would make the factor approximately 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the exponent was (ΔE/k) * (1/Teff2 - 1/Teff1). Wait, no: (1/Teff2 -1/Teff1) is positive because Teff2 =5500 < Teff1=6000. So 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000. So 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1.515e-5) K^-1.

But (ΔE/k) is (hc/(λ k))/k? Wait, no. Wait, (ΔE/k) is hc/(λ k) * (1/k)? No, wait no, (ΔE) is hc/(λ). So (ΔE/k) = [hc/(λ)] / k = (h c) / (λ k). Which is what I computed earlier as about 1e5 K.

So that part is correct.

So the factor is exp( (1e5) * 1.515e-5 ) ) = exp(1.515) ≈ 4.547.

So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than with spots. So the factor is 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer must be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature \(T\), and the problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots due to the lower effective temperature.

The effective temperature without spots is \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and with 40% of the surface covered by spots, it drops to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\)) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

To simplify calculations, we express \(\Delta E\) in terms of \(k T\), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \approx 10^5 \, \text{K}\), and calculating \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]

we find:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(10^5 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(1.515).
\]

Approximating \(\exp(1.515)\), we use \(\exp(1.5) \approx 4.4817\) and \(\exp(0.015) \approx 1.0151\). Thus:

\[
\exp(1.515) \approx 4.4817 \cdot 1.0151 \approx 4.547.
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
