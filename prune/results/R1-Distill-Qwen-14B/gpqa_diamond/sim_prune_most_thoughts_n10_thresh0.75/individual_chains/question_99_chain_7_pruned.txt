Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options given are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of branched carboxylic acids. Let me list them out to see the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, let me parse these structures correctly. It looks like each has a COOH group. The substituents on the carbons adjacent to the COOH might be different.

The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there are usually indicative of O-H stretching, which is common in carboxylic acids. So that makes sense because all the options have a COOH group.

The strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 is probably the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That fits with the COOH group as well because the carbonyl in carboxylic acids typically absorbs around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So that's consistent.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR doesn't show any vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds, which isn't an issue here since all options seem to be saturated.

The key NMR information is about the splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. I need to think about what splitting patterns indicate.

Let me recall that each coupling (J value) causes the splitting. So a doublet of triplets would mean a proton is coupled to two sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is next to two groups of protons, each with different coupling constants.

Wait, more specifically, splitting is determined by the number of adjacent (vicinal) protons. Let me consider each option's structure and the possible NMR signals.

First, I need to figure out the structure of each option.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Breaking this down: The chain is like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, wait, the structure would be CH2CH2 connected to a central CH group which is connected to two CH3s, and another CH group connected to two CH3s, and then COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like: The main chain is something like CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a gem-dimethyl group. Let me think: The formula for option D is (CH3CH2)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH? Or perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with two methyl groups on the second and third carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw each structure.

Option D: The main chain is probably CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)m-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the carbons. Let's see:

The formula for each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, that would make the chain:

COOH-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH3.

Wait, let me parse option A correctly. It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5) as the first part, then another C(H)(C2H5), then CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-CH2COOH.

So the central two carbons each have a H and a C2H5 (ethyl) group. The CH3 is attached to the first carbon, then the next two are each CH(C2H
