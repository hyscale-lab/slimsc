Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. The sphere has a radius R, and the charge is d distance away from the center. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images might come into play. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on it would be neutralized by the Earth, but wait, no, wait. No, wait, because the sphere is a conductor, the charge will redistribute. If it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away, but in this case, the sphere is initially neutral? Wait, the problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere, but it doesn't specify if it's initially charged. I think it's initially neutral, and when the charge q is placed near it, induced charges will appear.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, no, the sphere is conducting and grounded. So when a charge q is placed near it, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the conductor remains neutral overall because the ground allows charges to move. So, wait, no. Let me think. If the sphere is neutral and a positive charge q is placed near it, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the near side, making that side negatively charged, and the far side positive. But because the sphere is grounded, the excess positive charges on the far side would leave the sphere, right? So the sphere would end up with an induced charge equal and opposite to q? Or wait, no. Wait, no. If the sphere is neutral and a charge q is placed near it, the induced charge on the sphere would be -q, but since it's grounded, that would cause the sphere to have a net charge of -q. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, no, because if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can leave. Let me think again. For a conducting sphere, the charges move freely. If a positive charge is placed near it, the nearby electrons (negative) would move towards the charge. But since the sphere is grounded, those excess electrons can't accumulate, so the ones that move toward q would cause the sphere to lose electrons, meaning the sphere itself would have a positive charge. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, think of it this way: when a positive charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the charge. Since the conductor is connected to ground, electrons can flow into the ground, leaving the conductor with a net positive charge. So the sphere would have a charge +q induced? Or wait, no, because the induced charge isn't equal to q. Let me think about method of images.

The method of images says that a charge q outside a conducting sphere can be modeled by placing an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge is -q*(R/d'), where d' is the distance from the center to the image. Wait, no, wait, the image charge for a conducting sphere is such that the sphere's potential is zero. The image charge magnitude would be q*(R/d'), where d' is the distance from the charge to the center. So if the charge
