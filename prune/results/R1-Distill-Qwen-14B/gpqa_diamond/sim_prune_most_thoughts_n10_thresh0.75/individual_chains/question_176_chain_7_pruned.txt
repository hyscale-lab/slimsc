Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question deals with measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The state of the system is given, and I need to find the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring P and then Q.

Wait, wait. So the system's state at time t is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the length. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So I think the state vector is not normalized. Oh, but maybe it's given as a vector, and I have to normalize it first? Or maybe the question assumes it's already normalized. Hmm, but actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, so the sum of squares of the components should be 1. So perhaps I need to normalize it before proceeding.

So let me calculate the norm. As I did, sqrt(6). So the state vector should be divided by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. Let me see. The operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

And Q's matrix is:

First row: 1, 0, 0.
Second row: 0, 0, 0.
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So Q = diag(1, 0, -1). Oh, that's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring
