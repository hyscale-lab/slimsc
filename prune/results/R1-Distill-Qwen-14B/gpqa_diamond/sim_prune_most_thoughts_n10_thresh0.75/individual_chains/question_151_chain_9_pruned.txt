Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the observable P is a matrix with specific elements.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Oh wait, but the question isn't asking for the eigenvalues directly. It's asking for the probability of measuring 0 when you have a specific state. So maybe I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the overlap with the given state.

Wait, but let me think again. The observable P is a 3x3 matrix given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

So the matrix P looks like this:

[ 0          1/√2       0       ]
[1/√2       0          1/√2    ]
[ 0         1/√2       0       ]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

But wait, how do I find the eigenvalues? Let me try to find them. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write the matrix P - λ I:

[ -λ       1/√2        0       ]
[1/√2     -λ         1/√2     ]
[ 0       1/√2       -λ       ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix might be a bit involved, but let me try.

The determinant can be calculated using expansion by minors. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. The matrix seems to have some symmetry. Let's see, perhaps it's a tridiagonal matrix, which often has symmetric properties.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for
