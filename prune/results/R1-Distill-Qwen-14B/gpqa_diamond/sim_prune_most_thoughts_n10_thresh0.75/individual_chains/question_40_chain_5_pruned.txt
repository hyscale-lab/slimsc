Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry question, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two chemists are talking. The second chemist says, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." I need to figure out what that means. The options are A to D.

Hmm, the phrase "compounds are on top of each other" probably refers to something happening in the lab. Maybe when they're trying to isolate or purify compounds, if they are on top of each other, it might mean they are not separating properly.

Wait, in chromatography, for instance, when you separate compounds, if they have similar properties, they might elute together. Like, in a column, if two substances have similar polarity, they might interact with the stationary phase in the same way, so they don't separate and come out together. So the chromatogram would show a single peak, meaning the compounds didn't separate.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how the compounds stack in a column during a process like distillation. If they have similar boiling points, they might not distill separately. Or perhaps in crystallization, if their solubilities are similar, they might not form distinct crystals.

Another thought: if the compounds are bonding through non-covalent interactions, like van der Waals forces, maybe they stick together physically, making it hard to separate them. So if the chemist can't isolate them, they might say they're stuck on top of each other.

Wait, the options are about the properties of the compounds.
