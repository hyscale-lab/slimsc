Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because of hydrogen bonding. But I also remember that alcohols can have broad peaks too, but maybe less so than acids. So this might suggest either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Next, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak; that's typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower; that might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or something with conjugation. Wait, could it be an aromatic ring? Like a conjugated carbonyl group in an aromatic compound? Or maybe it's a double bond (C=O) in an ester or amide. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but if there are two carbonyl peaks, what does that imply? Could it be something like an ester and a ketone? Or maybe a conjugated system where the carbonyl is part of a ring, like a cyclic ester or lactone. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester and the other a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks include vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the molecule has a double bond. The presence of vinyl Hs might mean there's an alkene group somewhere in the structure. So, the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what gives a fragment of 45. Common fragments at 45 include things like (CH3)2COH, but wait, 45 is often the molecular ion for something like CH3COOH, but wait, wait. Alternatively, 45 can be a fragment from a larger molecule. Like, perhaps a CH2O group but that's 30, so maybe another approach. Let's think about the possible options given.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula could be something like an ester. For example, maybe methyl cyclohexanoate or something. Esters have both carbonyl groups (so two peaks in IR?), but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe an ester and an alcohol? But I'm not sure. Let's hold that thought.

Option B: C6H10O. That would be a formula for something with a double bond and maybe an oxygen. Could be a cyclic ether with a double bond, or maybe an alcohol with a double bond. But the IR shows O-H, so maybe an alcohol with a double bond. But then the IR has two carbonyl peaks, which would be a problem because an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps this option is not correct. Unless the carbonyl is something else.

Option C: C6H10O2. That formula could be a diester, or a ketone plus something else. Wait, 6 carbons, 10 Hs, 2 O's. Maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) or an ester with some substitution. Alternatively, an ester and an alcohol, but that's unlikely. Wait, perhaps something like a substituted cyclic ketone with an ester group? Hmm. Or maybe a compound with two carbonyl groups, like a diketone. But then, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Option D: C6H12O. That's a formula for something like a cyclic ether with a double bond and an alcohol, maybe. But again, the IR shows O-H and two carbonyl groups, which might not fit.

Wait, but in the IR, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think about what those could be. 1700 is probably a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, perhaps a carbonyl attached to a ring, like in an aromatic ketone. Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated double bond, like in an enone system.

So the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. That makes me think of something like a cinnamic acid derivative or an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. For example, methyl acrylate or something similar. Or perhaps a substituted maleic anhydride derivative. But wait
