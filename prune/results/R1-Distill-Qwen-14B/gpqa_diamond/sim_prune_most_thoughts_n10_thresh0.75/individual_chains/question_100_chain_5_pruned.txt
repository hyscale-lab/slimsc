Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to walk through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

So, the question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, in the presence of CCl4 and bromination, what happens? Oh right, that's a bromination reaction. For alkenes, adding Br2 in CCl4 would cause an addition reaction. So Compound A is probably propene (CH2=CHCH3), because cyclopropane would undergo ring-opening bromination, but I think propene is more likely here.

So when propene reacts with Br2 in CCl4, it forms 1,2-dibromopropane (I think that's compound B). Because propene has a double bond, and adding bromine would add across the double bond.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So B is a dibromide. If we have 1,2-dibromopropane and treat it with KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr twice. Wait, but would it eliminate once or twice? Since we're using alcoholic KOH, maybe it's a di-elimination.

Wait, let me think. 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, would eliminate both bromines. So the first elimination would form propene again, but wait, no. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo elimination. But wait, with two Br atoms adjacent, perhaps it's more likely that two eliminations happen. So first, one Br leaves, and a base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a double bond. But wait, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, upon treatment with KOH, it could lose two HBr molecules, forming a triple bond because 1,2-di elimination would form propyne (CHâ‰¡CCH3
