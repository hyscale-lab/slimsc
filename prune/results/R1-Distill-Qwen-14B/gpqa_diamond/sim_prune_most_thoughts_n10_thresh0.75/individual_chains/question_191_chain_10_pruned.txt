Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring (a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, so that's a CH2OH attached to carbon 3. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH(CH2-), but wait, no. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So, it's CH2-C(=CH2)-, wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. Wait, no. Let me draw it. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2–, but wait, no. Wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So, it's CH2-CH2CH2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2=CH-CH2– but the attachment is at the second carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH(CH2CH2) with a double bond? Not sure, maybe I should think of it as an isopropenyl group. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl group. So, it's CH2=C-CH2, but the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. So, it's (
