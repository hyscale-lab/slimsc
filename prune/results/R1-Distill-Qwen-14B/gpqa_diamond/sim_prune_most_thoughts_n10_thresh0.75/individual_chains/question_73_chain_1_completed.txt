Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's this formula from special relativity that you have to use. The formula for relative velocity is a bit tricky. Let me try to recall it. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So I'll plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7. That's 0.142857...c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed. So the relative speed part narrows it down to C or D.

Now, the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy is calculated using the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll compute the energy for each and then add them together.

First astronaut: mass 2m, v=0.6c. Gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 2m * 1.25 * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, v=0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approximately 1.1547. So his energy is 3m * 1.1547 * c². Let's calculate that: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and D has E=5 mc². So we can eliminate D because 5.96 is higher than 5. So the correct answer must be option C, which has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For the gamma of 0.5c, let me compute it precisely. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. Multiply by 3m: 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641 m c². 2.5 + 3.4641 is 5.9641, so yes, about 5.96. So option C is correct.

I think I've covered all steps. The options match the calculations, so the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = 2m \cdot 1.25 \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = 3m \cdot 1.1547 \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
