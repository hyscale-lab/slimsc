Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves an experiment where Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product, and I need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably think about what reaction is happening here. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a type of catalyst, maybe used in epoxide ring-opening reactions or something else. Wait, wait—another thought: sometimes this compound is used as a base in certain reactions, like in the formation or opening of epoxides. Oh right, I think it's often used in the acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, but wait, no, maybe it's a base. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugate addition or something else. Hmm.

But wait, Compound X is reacting with this reagent. Oh wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Because if the product shows an epoxide ring opening, but wait, looking at the product's NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienophile or something else. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! I think that's DABCO, which stands for 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. DABCO is a common reagent used in the opening of epoxides under basic conditions. Oh wait, no, actually, I remember that epoxide ring opening can be acid or base catalyzed. DABCO is a base, I think. So if Compound X is an epoxide, then reacting it with a base like DABCO might cause it to open.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So perhaps Compound X is an epoxide, which upon reaction with DABCO, undergoes ring-opening to form something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's less likely because of the conditions given. Or maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but if DABCO is a base, that might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: DABCO is also a catalyst for some cycloadditions. Oh, like the Diels-Alder reaction. So if Compound X is a dienophile, and the reagent is DABCO, maybe it's facilitating a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, in that case, the product would be a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, the product's NMR data: let's look at that.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s): a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an electronegative atom or a ring.

δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet, maybe another methyl.

Then some aromatic protons:

6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

So it's a substituted benzene ring, perhaps with substituents that cause the coupling. Let's see, the pattern looks like perhaps a para-substituted ring with two doublets and another set of doublets.

Wait, the aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). That's a bit confusing. Wait, another approach: maybe it's a vicinal di-substituted benzene, but more likely, it's showing a para substitution.

Wait, maybe it's a para-disubstituted aromatic ring. Let's see: the doublets could be from adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the coupling, for example, 6.75 is a doublet, which could be a proton next to two equivalent protons, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring where each substituent is causing coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the
