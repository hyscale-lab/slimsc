Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are five planets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So that's Planet_1 to Planet_5. The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Also, all planets have the same albedo, which I think means their reflectivity is the same, so that won't affect the temperature ratio.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and T_star is the star's effective temperature. But wait, no, actually, I think the formula is T = ( (L / (16πσ a²) ) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Alternatively, another form is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), assuming the star's luminosity is known.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to use the inverse square law for the flux. The flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance. Because the energy absorbed is proportional to L/(4πa²), and the planet emits as a blackbody, so T is proportional to (L/(4πa²))^1/4 * (1/(epsilon))^1/4. But since albedo (which is (1 - reflectivity) or emissivity?) is the same, epsilon is same. Wait, albedo is the fraction reflected, so emissivity would be (1 - albedo), but since they're the same, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Wait no, the period isn't the same as the distance. Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period
