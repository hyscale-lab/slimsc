Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology, specifically gene expression constructs and their expression in cells. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a bicistronic vector that's been constructed to express a ligand and a receptor. The setup is that the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. There are stop cassettes between the ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop-loxP) and between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272).

The experiment involves transfecting this vector into primary astrocyte cultures and then using antibodies to check for expression via Western blot. After that, they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice. They look for fluorescence under a confocal microscope but don't see any green signal, which is supposed to come from the eGFP.

So, the main issue is why there's no green signal. Let's think about each part.

First, the bicistronic vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in the same transcript, but each has its own promoter or uses internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) for separate translation. Here, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong and typically used for sustained expression. The receptor is after an IRES, which allows for the second ORF to be translated from the same mRNA.

The stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. These are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The loxP site is recognized by Cre, which in its presence, excises the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. Wait, but in the question, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so the stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, no: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand's ORF is first, then the stop cassette, then mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the ORF is followed by a stop and then eGFP.

Wait, no. Let me get this structure right. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. So the first part is ligand followed by mCherry. But there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between ligand and mCherry. So without Cre, the mCherry isn't expressed because the stop is in place. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, followed by eGFP, but with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed either.

But wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the CBA
