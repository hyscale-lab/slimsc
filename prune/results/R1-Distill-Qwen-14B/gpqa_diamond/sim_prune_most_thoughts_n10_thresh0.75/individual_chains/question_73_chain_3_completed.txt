Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity, right? So the question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. First, I need to find their relative speed. Wait, how do you calculate relative speed in relativity? Because in Newtonian mechanics, you just subtract the speeds, but relativity is different.

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the first astronaut is moving faster than the second. So their relative speed should be the difference adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

Let me plug in the numbers. Let's say astronaut A is 0.6c, astronaut B is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Then, the relative velocity u would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's calculate that numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So relative speed is about 0.14c.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, I think each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So total energy is the sum of their individual energies.

So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Gamma is 1.25, so E = gamma * m_total * c². Oh wait, m_total is 2m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². That makes sense.

Now the second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v squared is 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = let's compute that: 3 * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me re-calculate the gamma for the second astronaut.

Gamma for 0.5c: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Multiply by 3m, so 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641, yes. Then add to 2.5, gives 5.9641, which is about 5.96 mc². So option C's energy matches.

As for the relative speed, I got about 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c, matching option C and D. So option C has the correct energy and relative speed.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\(m = 2m, v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(m = 3m, v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
