Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3- ions. Wait, but wait, I remember that in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

So, I guess the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H3PO4) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). Wait, no, wait. Let me think about this. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- when dissolved. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh wait, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. So, each step goes from the higher to lower protonation state.

In the solution, we have KH2PO
