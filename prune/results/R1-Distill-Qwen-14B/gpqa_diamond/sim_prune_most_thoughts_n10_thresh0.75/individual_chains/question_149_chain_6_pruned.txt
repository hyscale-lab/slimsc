Okay, I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to break it down. So the scenario is about a chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR seems consistent, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Oh, and the coupling isn't the issue because they ruled out spin-spin coupling.

Hmm, so if it's the same alpha-proton showing two peaks, maybe it's something to do with the structure around it. Since coupling is ruled out, what else could cause splitting? Oh, wait, maybe it's not coupling. Maybe the molecule is in different environments because of some kind of stereoisomerism.

Looking at the options: Option B is enantiomers, D is diastereoisomers. Enantiomers would have the same NMR because they're mirror images, but wait, no. For 1H NMR, enantiomers would have identical spectra because the environment is the same. So if the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, that shouldn't be due to enantiomers. Unless... wait, no. Because if the molecule is a racemic mix, the NMR would just show the same as a single enantiomer. So B might not be the case.

Option D: Diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would be different. But wait, in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. How does that fit? Unless there are diastereomers that lead to a different environment for the alpha-proton, but no, because each diastereomer would have a unique environment. But wait, the NMR is for one sample, but perhaps the crude sample is a mix of diastereomers. Oh, but how would that look in the NMR?

Wait, but if there's a mix, wouldn't each diastereomer present have its own set of protons? So the NMR would show a multiplet? Or in this case, the two peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer might be overlapping? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are from different conformations, but conformations usually don't split the peaks unless there's exchange, but that's more of a slow exchange situation leading to separate peaks. Wait, but the problem states that the integrals add up to 1H, so maybe each peak is 0.5H each? No, that doesn't make sense because each proton should be split into two if coupled, but coupling is ruled out.

Wait, the problem says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So same proton but in two different environments. So perhaps the molecule is present in two different stereoisomeric forms, causing the same proton to resonate at slightly different shifts. Like, maybe a diastereomer where the proton is in a different environment, but the same in another.

Wait, but if the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, like epimers, then each would have their own NMR signals. But the question says the 1H NMR of the crude compound has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So for each diast
