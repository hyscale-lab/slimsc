Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

Wait, the question gives me some [X/Y] abundances for both stars. I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So, for example, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, which means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times the ratio in the Sun. Got it.

The problem statement says that each star's elemental abundances are determined using the EW method, and LTE is assumed. I don't think I need to get into the details of those methods for this problem; just the given abundances matter.

The goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si1 / n_Si2) is what we're looking for.

Let me list out the given data:

For Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe1 / n_H1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun)

For Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun)
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg2 / n_H2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun)

Wait, the Sun's photosphere composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

So for the Sun:
nFe_sun / nH_sun = 1e-4.5
nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5

Now, let me think about Star_1 first. [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → so the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. Which implies that n_H1 is the same multiple as n_H_sun, but I don't think I need the exact number of H atoms, just the ratios.

Wait, but for the ratio of Si in Star_1, I can get n_Si1 in terms of n_F
