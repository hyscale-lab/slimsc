Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? This usually happens when the molecule has a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element, like a plane of symmetry or something else.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining numbers 1-4 in different ways. Let me think about each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different isomerism based on their substituents. I remember that if the substituents are in positions that allow for different stereoisomer possibilities, like trans or cis positions, then maybe they can have optical isomers. But wait, in biphenyls, the substituents on each ring can cause the rings to rotate, but if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center or a plane of symmetry, then maybe not. Alternatively, if there's a non-superimposable mirror image, they would have optical isomerism. Since this compound has two nitro groups on each ring at the 6 and 6' positions, and two carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2' positions, I'm thinking if those substituents create a chiral center. Wait, no, because each ring has two substituents, but maybe the biphenyl as a whole has a certain symmetry. Or perhaps the substituents are on positions that make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to possible optical isomerism. I'm a bit unsure about this one. Let's come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be something like CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Let me write that: the propanoate has three carbons. Carbon 1: COOCH3, carbon 2: OH and CH3. So the structure is CH3-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. Hmm, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoate. So the structure would be: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, the molecule has a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with OH and two CH3 groups and the COOCH3 group). So yes, that carbon has four different groups attached: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait, wait. Let me see: the second carbon has two CH3
