Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution and excitation of energy levels.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's probably the same as k, the Boltzmann constant, because I recall k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so maybe the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times the temperature or something?

Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor relates the population of energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, the higher energy level is less populated, so the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). Or wait, sometimes people write it as (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), but if the degeneracies are the same, then it's just the exponential part.

In this case, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, the number of excited atoms is 2x that of star_2. Let me denote the excitation as the population of the upper level. So, n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. But since the stars are in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations depends on temperature.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the excitation is the ratio of the upper level to the lower level. Because for each star, the excitation would be n_upper / n_lower. So if star_1 has twice the excitation compared to star_2, then (n_upper1/n_lower1) / (n_upper2/n_lower2) ) = 2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Actually, the excitation level is the ratio of the population of the upper state to that of the lower state. So for each star, that ratio is determined by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1: (n_upper
