Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I should recall what each part of the NMR tells me. The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) usually corresponds to protons attached to the benzene ring. The fact that there are two singlets suggests that in each compound, the aromatic protons are equivalent, or perhaps each compound has a set of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but since it's a 1:1 mixture, the two singlets would likely come from two different compounds. Each compound contributes its own aromatic protons, but because they're in a 1:1 ratio, each contributes equally. So each aromatic region signal is from each compound. So each compound must have a single type of aromatic proton, or perhaps they have more than one set, but in the case of the mixture, each contributes one singlet.

Alternatively, maybe each compound has equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a singlet each. So each aromatic compound in the mixture would have a single set of equivalent aromatic protons. That makes sense because if they had more than one type, we'd see more signals.

Now, given the molecular formula C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C10H14. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, this would be (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So 4 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent) plus a double bond or another ring, but since both are aromatic compounds, each probably has a benzene ring and some substituents.

Wait, wait, each compound is C10H14, but if it's a benzene ring (C6H6), then the substituents must account for C4H8. Let's see, for each compound, the formula is C10H14, which is C6H5-R, where R is C4H9. But wait, that's not right because C6H5 is C6H5, so substituting, the R would be C4H9, which is a butyl group. Hmm, but in the options, the structures are tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzenes.

Wait, let me think. Each compound has the formula C10H14. The benzene ring is C6H6, so the substituents would contribute C4H8. So each substituent must be four carbons and eight hydrogens. That could be two ethyl groups: each ethyl is C2H5, so two would give C4H10. But that's more than C4H8. Alternatively, perhaps four methyl groups: four methyl groups would be C4H12, but that's more than C4H8. Hmm, maybe there's another structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are four methyl groups and another group. Wait, no, each substituent would be attached to the ring. Let me think again. Each compound must have a benzene ring with substituents adding up to C4H8. Let's think about the substituents.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an ethyl group. Two ethyl groups would contribute C4H10. But the ring would be C6H5, so the total would be C6H5(C2H5)2 â†’ C8H12. That's not matching C10H14. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Maybe each substituent is a methyl group. Four methyl groups would be C4H12. So benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (C4H12) gives a total of C10H18. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which has two fewer hydrogens. So maybe the substituents are not all methyl. Wait, perhaps some substituents have double bonds or rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ethyl groups but with some double bonds. Wait, maybe each substituent is a propyl group, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a combination of methyl and ethyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the
