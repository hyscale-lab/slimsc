Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z, which is the uncertainty in the z-component of some operator P. 

Right, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then plug them into this formula.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which is the computational basis here, probably |+z⟩ and |−z⟩, but wait, the vector has three components. Oh, wait, maybe it's a three-level system? Like spin-1 or something.

Wait, the matrices are 3x3. So the system has three possible states, likely m = -1, 0, +1 for some angular momentum. But in any case, the basis is ordered as the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z.

The given state is a column vector (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Let me confirm if this is a normalized vector. Let me compute the squared magnitudes:

(1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, another 1/4. So sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Yes, it's normalized.

So the state |ψ⟩ is given by ψ = [ -1/2 , 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

Now, I need to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. That's easy, since P_z is diagonal in this basis. The expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, the P_z matrix is given. Let me write it out:

P_z
