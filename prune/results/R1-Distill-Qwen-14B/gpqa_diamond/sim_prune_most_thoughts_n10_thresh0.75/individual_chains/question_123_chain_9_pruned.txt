Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, so no acceleration involved here. The problem asks how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation in special relativity. Oh right, because the frames are moving relative to each other, time intervals will appear different in each frame. So if a certain amount of time passes in one frame, the other frame will measure a different time.

Let me recall the Lorentz transformations. Time dilation formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/cÂ² ), but I'm not sure if that's exactly applicable here. Alternatively, from the perspective of one frame, the other frame's clocks are moving, so time intervals in the moving frame are longer.

Wait, the problem is about the distance traveled. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity. But in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So these are two different velocities, but related by the relative motion between the frames.

Wait, I think the velocity in one frame can be found using the velocity addition
