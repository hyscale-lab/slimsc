Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction. I need to find the reactants and products for each, then match them to the options given.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile typically comes from an enolate attacking the beta position.

So, looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A.

Dimethyl malonate is a diester, right? Structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. It can form enolates because the malonate has two ester groups, which are good for deprotonation. The base NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH would deprotonate the malonate at the alpha position, forming an enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let's break that down. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent here is at the 3-position with E-configuration. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CO-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH2 group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; but in this case, the substituent is at the 3-position. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the acrylate is a three-carbon chain where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHCO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group at the 3rd carbon? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(C6H4-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-p-tolylacrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, that might not be possible because the acrylate is a three-carbon structure. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, another approach: the Michael donor is the enolate (from dimethyl malonate), and the acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The acrylate would be the acceptor. So, the structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group substituting on the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps I got that wrong. Or perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-C6H4-p-tolyl? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-C6H4-tolyl? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3 but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the acrylate group. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-tolyl)COOCH3 but that would be a 2-substituted acrylate, but the question says 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but with
