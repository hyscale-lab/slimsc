Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about spin systems and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, let's see what the question says.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z. The options are A through D, each with different expressions involving exponential terms.

I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I need to figure out all possible states of the system. Each spin has two possible values, so three spins mean 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being either +1 or -1. So the states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Wait, but maybe it's easier to group states by their energy rather than considering each one individually. Because the energy expression depends on the products of pairs of spins. So each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.

Let me compute the energy E for each state. The energy formula is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].

Let me think about this. Each pair S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same, -1 otherwise. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary.

Let me compute for each state:

State 1: All spins +1. So each pair product is 1. Sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 → E = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, E = -J [sum], so for sum -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate that. Sum is 1 (S1S2) + (-1) (S1S3) + (-1) (S2S3) → sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J*1 = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1 → E = J.

Same as state 2.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1= -1 → E=J.

So states 2,3,4 all have E=J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1 → E=J.

Hmm, same as before. So state5 is E=J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E=J.

Same. State6: E=J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1 → E=J.

State7: E=J.

State8: All spins -1. Each pair product is 1. Sum is 3. E= -J*3 → E=-3J.

So now, what are the possible energies and their multiplicities.

Looking at the energies:

- State1 and state8 have E=-3J. So there are 2 states with E=-3J.

- The other 6 states (2,3,4,5,6,7) have E=J.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). Since each state contributes exp(-β E), and for each energy, we have multiple states.

So Z = sum [g(E) * exp(-β E)].

Here, g(E) is the number of states with that energy.

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, because E for the two states is -3J. So exp(-β E) would be exp(3Jβ).

Similarly, for the 6 states with E=J, exp(-β J). So the term is 6 exp(-Jβ).

So the partition function is Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). So that's option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's compute each term:

For state with E=-3J, which is the ground state (lowest energy), the exponential is exp(3 J beta) because E is negative. So for each of these two states, the term is e^{3 J beta}, and there are two such states, so 2 e^{3 J beta}.

The other 6 states have E=J. So their contribution is 6 * e^{-J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^{Jβ} → No, because E=-3J would give exp(3Jβ), not exp(-3Jβ). So A is incorrect.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I have.

Another option: Option D is 6 e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No, that's not matching.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Each spin has two possible values, so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The energy \( E \) depends on the pairwise spin products \( S_iS_j \), which are \( +1 \) if the spins are the same and \( -1 \) if they are different. By evaluating \( E \) for all 8 states, we find:

- **States 1 and 8** (all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \)): \( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = +1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \). These are the two lowest-energy states.
- **States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**: These states have one pair of spins aligned and the others misaligned. For example, in state 2 (\( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)), \( S_1S_2 = +1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \). All six of these states have \( E = J \).

Thus, the energy levels and their multiplicities are:

- \( E = -3J \): 2 states.
- \( E = J \): 6 states.

The partition function is then:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} \exp(-\beta E).
\]

For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \). For \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \). Therefore:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are wrong.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
