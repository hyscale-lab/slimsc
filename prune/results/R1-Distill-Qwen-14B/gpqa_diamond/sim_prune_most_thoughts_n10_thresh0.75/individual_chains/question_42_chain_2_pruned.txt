Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again.

Astronomers are studying three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here, maybe it's just background info.

The question gives me the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So the temperature ratios are 1.4 and 2.3 respectively. Wait, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect black body, right? It depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

The masses are also given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, mass ratios: 1.15 and 1.35.

We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo of 0.3, same as Earth.

Hmm. So, equilibrium temperature formula. I remember that equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is distance from star. Oh wait, but wait, if we're comparing planets around the same star, L and σ are constants. So T ∝ 1/d^(1/4).

Wait, but maybe the formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ d²)]^(1/4), where a is albedo. Since all albedos are same (0.3), that part cancels out when taking ratios.

So, T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/4) * sqrt(sqrt(...)) something. Or wait, let's think. If T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4), then T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/4). Because T is inversely proportional to d^(1/4), so when d increases, T decreases. So if T1 is higher than T2, d2 must be larger than d1.

Wait, let's do it with variables. Let me denote:

T1 is temperature of Planet1.

d1 is distance of Planet1 from star.

Similarly, T2, d2.

Because T ∝ 1/d^(1/4), so T1 / T2 = (d2 / d1)^(1/4). So to get d2 in terms of d1, rearrange: (T1/T2)^4 = d2/d1.

So d2 = d1 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ratio T1/T2 is given as 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 T2.

So, from the formula, T1 / T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/4).

Then, raising both sides to the 4th power: (T1/T2)^4 = d2/d1.

So d2 =
