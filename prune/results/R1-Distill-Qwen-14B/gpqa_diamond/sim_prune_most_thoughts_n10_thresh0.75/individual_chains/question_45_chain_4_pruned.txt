Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n. The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²) * (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E, where E is the base energy given.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Since they are spin-1/2, which is a fermion, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique state.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum numbers for a particle are determined by n, the principal quantum number, and the spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each particle has two possible spin states: up or down. So each n can hold two particles.

Wait, but wait, the spin is part of the overall quantum state. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So each n level can accommodate two fermions.

So with four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

The ground state would be the lowest possible energy. So the particles would fill the lowest available n's, each with their spin.

So let's list the possible n's and how many particles each can take.

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles (again, two spins)
n=3: but wait, if we have four particles, maybe n=1 and n=2 would be filled.

Wait, four particles. So n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take 2. So all four would be in n=1 and n=2 levels.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. Each n can have two particles. So for four particles, we can have n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). That would be the ground state. Because lower n is filled first.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²)=E. But wait, two particles here, so 2*E.

Each particle in n=2 contributes E*(2²)=4E. Two particles, so 2*4E =8E.

Total ground state energy is 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So the ground state is the lowest possible, which is 10E?

Wait, but let me think again. What's the order
