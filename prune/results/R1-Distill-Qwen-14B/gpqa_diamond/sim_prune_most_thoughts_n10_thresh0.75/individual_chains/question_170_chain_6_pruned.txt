Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that means the spin state vector is [3i, 4]^T. Oh wait, but sometimes I've seen spin states in the form of column vectors. So yeah, the state ψ is (3i, 4), which would be a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

Now, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ. Oh wait, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. Right, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And ħ (hbar) comes into play when dealing with spin operators because the spin components are S = ħ/2 σ.

So first, I need to compute the matrix product σ_y multiplied by the state vector ψ, and then take the conjugate transpose of ψ and multiply by that result.

Let me write down the state vector as ψ = [3i; 4]. So ψ† would be [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, no, the conjugate transpose. So ψ is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So ψ† would be a row vector [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, wait, 4 is a real number, so 4* is 4. But 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ].

Now, let's compute σ_y ψ. Let's see, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Multiplying σ_y by ψ gives:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [
