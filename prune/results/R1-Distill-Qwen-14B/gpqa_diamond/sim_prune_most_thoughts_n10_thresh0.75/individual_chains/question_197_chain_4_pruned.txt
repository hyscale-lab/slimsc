Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then predicting the product after a reaction. Hmm, I think I'll start by analyzing the given data.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl peak, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and possibly an O-H group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The signals are: 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H) – that's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and the broadness suggests it's exchanging. Then, 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H) – that's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, two protons each as doublets, probably para substitution. So the aromatic part is probably para-substituted.

Then, 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H) – maybe a CH near an electronegative group or in a carbonyl environment. 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H) – could be a CH2 adjacent to something. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – that's a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a nitrogen. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, like part of an ethyl chain.

Putting the NMR together: the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene. The 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid. So maybe the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group? Wait, but the IR also has the 1720 peak which could be a carbonyl. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is close. So that fits.

Wait, but looking again at the NMR: the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is typical for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are in a para arrangement, so it's a 4-substituted benzene. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene.

But looking at the other NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 (m, 2H) might be CH2. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to something else, perhaps a CH group. And the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so maybe part of an ethyl group.

So putting that together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group on one para position and another substituent on the opposite. Wait, but the IR has peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are aromatic. So the substituent is probably para to another group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone or an ester. But the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent that's an alkoxy group or an alkyl chain.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Let me think: maybe it's a structure like benzene with a -CH2-COOH group? No, that would give a different proton pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl. For example, a benzoyl group with a side chain.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring attached to a ketone group with an adjacent CH group. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the structure is something like benzene-(CH2)n-COOH.

Let me think about the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH near a carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2-CHO-COOH structure. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the 2.9 is a CH group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in an ester or amide, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak apart from the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the overall structure. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 for 1H, which is a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are in a para substitution, so two doublets, each 2H, in the 8.0 and 7.2 regions. So the substituents are on the para positions. One substituent is the carboxylic acid, and the other is an ethyl group or something with a chain.

Wait, the 1.4 (d, 3H) and 2
