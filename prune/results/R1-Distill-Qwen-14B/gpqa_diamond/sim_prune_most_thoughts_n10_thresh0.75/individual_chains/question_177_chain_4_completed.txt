Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that astronomers are looking at the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Through spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars are black bodies and want to compute the luminosity ratio, with Star_1 being greater by a factor. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing the luminosities, the constants would cancel out, so L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same, right? Because T = b / λ_max. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, so it's not moving towards or away much. Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect observations? Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength would shift based on the star's velocity. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, perhaps we need to consider that the observed λ_max is the same for both, but their actual temperatures might be different. Because if one is moving towards us and the other is moving away, their observed λ_max would shift, but in this case, both have the same observed λ_max. Wait, but Star_1 has 0 velocity, so its observed λ is the same as its actual λ. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the direction. For example, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed λ would be blueshifted, meaning lower wavelength. If it's moving away, it's redshifted, higher wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps we have to calculate the actual temperature of each star considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, so when a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths it emits are blueshifted, but the peak emission would be at a different wavelength. So, if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max would shift. But the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, perhaps Star_2's actual temperature is different from Star_1's, but due to Doppler shift, their observed λ_max is the same. Hmm, this complicates things.

Let me think. Let me denote T1 and T2 as the actual temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2. The observed λ_max of Star_1 is λ1_obs = λ_max for T1. For Star_2, since it's moving, the observed λ_max would be λ2_obs. But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So for Star_2, its actual λ_max is λ2_actual = b / T2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength would be different. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed λ_max? The Doppler shift formula for light is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, that's for transverse motion maybe? Or radial. Let me think. The formula I remember for radial velocity is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer (if positive, it's moving away, if negative, towards). But wait, wait, I think the correct formula is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for small velocities, z ≈ v_r / c. But when the velocities are much less than the speed of light, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_source (1 + v_r / c) where v_r is positive if moving away, negative if approaching.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards you at velocity v (v much less than c) is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 - v/c). Because when the source is moving towards you, the light is blueshifted, so the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted.

Wait, let me double-check. If a source emits light at λ_emit, and it's moving towards the observer with velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c). Because the light waves are compressed, so higher frequency, shorter wavelength.

So, for Star_2, its actual λ_emit would be λ2_actual = b / T2. But due to its velocity, the observed λ2_obs is λ2_actual * (1 - v2 / c), where v2 is positive if moving towards (blueshift). Wait, but the problem says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. It doesn't specify the direction, but perhaps it's moving away, so v would be positive, resulting in a redshift. Or maybe it's moving towards us, which would give blueshift.

Hmm, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. It doesn't specify direction, but I think radial velocity is given as the speed, so perhaps the direction is away for Star_2. Wait, but the wording just says 0 and 700, so perhaps Star_1 is not moving, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But the problem says they have the same observed λ_max. So, how does this tie into their actual temperatures?

Let me think again. For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, the observed λ_max is the same as the emitted. So λ1_obs = λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2, it's moving. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Wait, let me get the Doppler shift correct. 

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving directly away. But for small velocities, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_source (1 + v/c).

Wait, but if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is blueshifted. So the formula would be λ_obs ≈ λ_source (1 - v/c), when v is positive in the direction of approach.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, v_r is negative (since moving towards, so v_r = -700 km/s). Then λ2_obs ≈ λ2_emit (1 - (-700 / c)) ) = λ2_emit (1 + 700 / c).

Wait, but since the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, we have λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c), where v_r2 is the radial velocity of Star_2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it down:

λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since Star_1's velocity is 0, so v_r1 = 0)

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Doppler effect formula when the source is moving is:

λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the velocity along the line of sight, positive if moving away, negative if moving towards.

So,

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 → λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Wait, but wait— the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700. So, if Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s, but which way? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we have to assume it's moving towards us or away. But the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, let's denote v_r2 as 700 km/s, but we don't know direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's moving away, so v_r is positive.

But let me think: if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit (1 + 700 / c ). Because moving away causes redshift. If Star_1's observed λ is same as Star_2's, then λ1_emit = λ2_obs → λ1_emit = λ2_emit (1 + 700/c )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Which simplifies to:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, perhaps I should set λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So,

λ1_emit = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs is λ2_emit multiplied by (1 + v_r2 / c ), because if v_r2 is positive (moving away), then λ_obs is longer than λ_emit. So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2 / c )

Multiply both sides by T2 T1:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, no, let me re-arrange:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) * (1/T2 )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, is that correct? Because,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c) * (1/T2 )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then v_r2 is positive, so T2 would be higher than T1? Because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1. But that would mean T2 is hotter than T1. Hmm, but let's think about it. If a star is moving away, its observed peak wavelength is longer, implying a lower observed temperature. But the actual temperature is higher? No, wait, no: the actual temperature is determined from the emitted wavelengths. So, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which would make us think that the temperature is lower. But the actual temperature is T2, and the observed λ_max is higher, so T_obs = T2 / (1 + v/c ), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the observed temperature. The observed temperature would be T_obs = T_emit / (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is positive when moving away. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed T would be lower than its actual T.

But in the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So, the observed temperatures would be the same? Because λ_max is the same, so T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Wait, but no, because λ_max is same for both, so using Wien's law, T_obs1 = T_obs2. But for Star_1, T_obs1 = T1, because it has zero radial velocity. For Star_2, T_obs2 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ), because it's moving away. So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that makes sense. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed temperature is lower than its actual temperature. But since the observed temperatures must match (because observed λ_max is same), we have T1 = T2_obs = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, that gives T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the observed λ_max for each star and then set them equal.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_1: it's not moving, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2: it's moving, so λ2_obs = (λ2_emit) * (1 + v_r2 /c )

But λ2_emit = b / T2.

So, Star_2's observed λ_max is (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Since both λ1_obs and λ2_obs are same:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

We can cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

So, this is the relation between T2 and T1.

But wait, v_r2 is 700 km/s. What is c in km/s? The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v_r2 / c is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333..., approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

Thus, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than that of Star_1.

But wait, this seems a small effect. Because 700 km/s is much less than c, so the correction is small. But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore it? Or maybe not, because the options are varying by about 0.03 (like 2.23, 2.25, etc.), so perhaps the correction is necessary.

But let's proceed.

Now, the problem is to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2.

L = 4π R² σ T^4

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

The R2^2 cancels out, so 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( 1 / (1 + v_r2/c ))^4

Compute 1 + v_r2/c = 1 + 700/(3e5) = 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333....

So,

1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, but wait: 1.002333 is approximately 1.002333, so 1/1.002333 is approximately 0.99768.

Then, (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99768^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99527.

Then, 0.99527^2 ≈ (approx) (0.995)^2 ≈ 0.990025, but more accurately:

0.99527 * 0.99527:

= (1 - 0.00473)^2

= 1 - 2*0.00473 + (0.00473)^2

≈ 1 - 0.00946 + 0.0000224

≈ 0.99056

Wait, maybe a calculator would help, but perhaps I should compute it precisely.

But perhaps I can just calculate (1 - x)^4 where x is small.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² -4x^3 +x^4.

x is 0.002333, so 4x≈0.00933, 6x²≈6*(0.000005444)=0.00003266, which is negligible.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332= 0.990668.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990668 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990668.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But wait, 0.990668 is 0.99 + 0.000668.

So 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000668 = approx 0.0015.

So total is about 2.2275 + 0.0015 = 2.229.

Wait, but wait, 0.990668 is approximately 0.99067.

So 2.25 * 0.99067 = ?

Let me compute 2 * 0.99067 = 1.98134.

0.25 * 0.99067 = 0.2476675.

Sum: 1.98134 + 0.2476675 = 2.2290075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23 and option C is ~2.35.

Wait, but wait. Did I do all that correctly?

Let me double-check the steps.

1. L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 )/( R2^2 T2^4 )

2. R1=1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

3. Temperature ratio: T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v_r2/c )

v_r2 =700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → 700/3e5 = 7/(3000) = 0.002333...

So, 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, T1/T2 = 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

4. (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99067.

5. So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23. So option D is ~2.23.

But wait, in the problem statement, the question says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of". So L1/L2 would be about 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, another thing. The problem says the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But if the stars are on the main sequence, their luminosity would also relate to their mass, but since the problem is using the black body assumption, that might not matter here. However, the question gives masses, but I don't think they factor into the calculation since we're using the black body formula and given the same observed λ_max.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
R_1 = 1.5 R_2
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars are observed to have the same peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)), which implies their observed temperatures are the same. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1 (with no radial velocity, \( v_r = 0 \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2 (with radial velocity \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_r / c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \), we equate:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_r / c)
\]

Canceling \( b \) and solving for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r / c)
\]

The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99768
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99768)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(0.99768)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 0.990668
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.990668 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
