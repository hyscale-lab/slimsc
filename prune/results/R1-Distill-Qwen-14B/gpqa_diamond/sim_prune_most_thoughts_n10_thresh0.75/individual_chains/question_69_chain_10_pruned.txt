Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The decay given is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that particle decay and detection has something to do with the proper lifetime and the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the lifetime observed in the lab frame depends on the particle's speed and the time dilation from relativity. So the formula I think I need is the Lorentz factor gamma multiplied by the proper time τ₀ gives the dilated lifetime τ.

Gamma is calculated using gamma = E/(m c²). Oh wait, because E is given as 27 GeV and the mass is 3.41 GeV. Oh, because E is the total energy of the particle, right?

So let me compute gamma first. Gamma equals E divided by m c squared. But since the mass is given in GeV/c² (because E = mc²), I think the units will work out. So E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, so 7.92 or so? Let me do it more accurately. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 27-23.87=3.13. 3.13 /3.41 ≈0.918. So gamma is about 7.918.

So now, the dilated lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by tau_0. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 8 *7.918 is around 63.344, so τ ≈63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, but the lifetime is dilated because the particle is moving at a high speed. But how does this relate to the minimum resolution? Oh, right, the resolution must be good enough to measure the decay length in the lab frame. Because the particle is moving, it travels some distance before decaying. The minimum resolution needed is such that at least 30% of the particles' decay paths are detected, I think. Or maybe the detector's resolution must be able to measure a distance that's at least 30% of the maximum possible length, but I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, the maximum possible proper decay length (the length the particle can travel before decaying) is c * τ. Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at speed v, so the distance it can
