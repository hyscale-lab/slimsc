Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think out loud.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of parallax (p), so d = 1 / p. So parallax and distance are inversely related.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, and p is inversely proportional to distance. Let me write that down. So p = 1/d. Therefore, 1/p would be d, right? So substituting p with 1/d, I get 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait, let me make sure. 

Wait, N ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d, then 1/p = d. So substituting p into the equation:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. Taking the reciprocal, 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So 1/p^5 becomes d^5, so N is proportional to d^5. Wait, that would mean N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is asking how N changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, and how that number changes with d.

Wait, I think I might have mixed something up. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume in space is uniform? Or is the distribution such that more stars are found in certain regions? The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Hmm. So N ∝ 1/p^5. But p is 1/d, so N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but wait, that might not make sense because typically, when you look out into space, the number of stars you can see decreases with distance because they're farther away. But this question is about a specific region where the number varies in this particular way. So perhaps in that region, the star density is higher at greater distances? Or maybe I'm misapplying the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax p is in arcseconds, and d in parsecs, so d = 1/p. So p = 1/d. So if I have N ∝ 1/p^5, that would be N ∝ d^5. But wait, if stars are more numerous at larger distances, that would mean that as you go further, you find more stars per unit volume? That's a bit counterintuitive because in reality, the density of stars in the galaxy decreases with distance from the galactic plane, but maybe this is a different scenario. Maybe the question is about a region where stars are distributed in a certain way, not necessarily the Milky Way's structure.

But putting that aside, the question is about how N changes with distance. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to find the differential number of stars with respect to distance.
