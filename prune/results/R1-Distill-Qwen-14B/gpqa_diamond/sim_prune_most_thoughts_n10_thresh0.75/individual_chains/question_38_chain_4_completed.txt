Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are compounds formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. They're useful in various reactions because they can undergo different types of reactions like nucleophilic substitutions and electrophilic additions. The question is about figuring out the product B and the correct sequence of reagents A.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to draw its structure. So, the base is ethanaminium, which is like a protonated ethylamine. The substituents are N-methyl and a pentan-2-ylidene group. Pentan-2-ylidene would be a double bond between C2 and C3, right? So the structure is probably (E)-configuration: the N has a methyl group, a CH2CH2CH2CH2... wait, no. Let's see, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C2—so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but as a substituent on the amine.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the structure: the amine has a CH2=CH(CH2CH2CH3?) No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be (CH2)3CH2- with a double bond at position 2. So it's like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because pentan-2-ylidene would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2(CH2CH2CH2CH3) with a double bond? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as a substituent attached via the double bond. So the starting material is N-methyl substituted, and the other substituent is a pentan-2-ylidene group, which is a five-carbon chain with a double bond at position 2.

So the structure is something like: the nitrogen is attached to a methyl group and a CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is:

The structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the IUPAC name for pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that's pent-2-enyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is a 5-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the double bond at C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but where is it attached to the amine? Wait, the starting material is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Ethanaminium is CH3NH3+. So the N has two substituents: methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to N, and another methyl attached to N, and the ethanaminium part would be like CH3NHCH2-CH2-... No, perhaps I should think of it differently.

Wait, ethanaminium is [CH3NH3]+, so the structure is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the N has a methyl group, a pentan-2-ylidene group, and the ethanaminium part is CH2CH3 attached to N. Wait, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to sketch it mentally as the amine has a CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- group attached, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

The reaction given is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + reagent A → product B.

Looking at the options, the product B is either heptan-4-one or pentan-2-one along with some amine, or maybe the product is just a ketone. So the starting material is a quaternary ammonium species, perhaps? Or maybe it's an iminium ion?

Wait, when secondary amines react with carbonyl compounds, they form enamines. But here, the starting material is an iminium ion. I think that when you have an iminium ion (like a protonated amine attached to a double bond), it can undergo various reactions. Oh wait, in enamine chemistry, the amine is often deprotonated to form the enamine, which can then react with electrophiles.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an iminium ion, which is a protonated enamine. The reaction sequence A would involve deprotonating and then doing some alkylation, maybe. Let's think about the steps.

I remember that in some enamine reactions, the enamine is treated with a strong base to deprotonate it, forming a more reactive species. Then, it can undergo alkylation, perhaps with an alkyl halide. After that, protonation or hydrolysis may give the ketone or aldehyde.

So let's think about the reagents. The options for A are either (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ or varying sequences.

LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used to deprotonate compounds. DME is a solvent (1,2-dimethoxyethane). So, if the first step is LDA in DME, that would deprotonate the iminium ion to form the enamine anion.

Then, adding an alkyl iodide, like CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), would alkylate the enamine. After that, acidic workup (H3O+) would protonate it, and then hydrolysis would break the enamine to give the ketone.

Wait, but what's the structure after each step?

Starting with (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

If we deprotonate it with a strong base like LDA, which would abstract the alpha proton (the one adjacent to the N), giving an enamine anion.

Then, treating with ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) would alkylate the enamine at the alpha position. So the enamine would have an ethyl group added.

After that, protonation with H3O+ (acid workup) would give the protonated enamine, which upon hydrolysis would break into the ketone and the amine.

Wait, but let's think about the structure.

Original starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to N, along with a methyl group and an ethyl group (from ethanaminium). Wait, no, ethanaminium is CH3NH3+. So the structure is N-methyl, N-(pentan-2-ylidene) ethanaminium. So the molecule would be:

The nitrogen is bonded to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 (from pentan-2-ylidene)
- CH2CH3 (from ethanaminium, which is CH3NH3+)

Wait, that can't be right. Because CH3NH3+ would be ethanaminium, so the N is attached to two CH3 groups and a CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ethanaminium is CH3NH3+ with two substituents: a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group. So the N has a methyl, a CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2- group (since pentan-2-ylidene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-?), but wait, that would be a six-carbon chain. No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is five carbons with the double bond at position 2: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is a five-carbon group with a double bond starting at C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So the starting material is N-methyl-N-(CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3) ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium part is CH3NH3+. So the nitrogen has:

- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 (pentan-2-ylidene)
- and the ethanaminium part, which is CH2CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give three substituents on N. So perhaps it's N-methyl, N-pentan-2-ylidene, and the ethanaminium is a positive charge. Hmm, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is [CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3] attached to N, which also has a methyl group and an ethanaminium group. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the starting material is an iminium ion, which is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, no, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is likely:

The nitrogen is connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- a pentan-2-ylidene group (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3)
- and a CH2CH3 group from ethanaminium.

Wait, that would make three substituents on N, which is possible because the nitrogen is in a quaternary state (since it's an ammonium ion). So the N has four bonds: three substituents and the positive charge.

So the structure is:

N(CH3)(CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3)(CH2CH3)+.

Now, when we treat this with a base like LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), it will deprotonate the alpha position to the N. The alpha protons are adjacent to the double bond. So which proton would be abstracted?

The enamine structure would have the double bond between the N and the adjacent carbon. Wait, the starting material is an iminium ion, so the structure is more like (CH2CH3)N+-(CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3)-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the starting material as an iminium ion, which has the structure R2N+=CH-R', where R and R' are substituents.

In this case, the R groups are methyl and pentan-2-ylidene's substituent, and R' is CH2CH3 (from ethanaminium).

When deprotonated by LDA, the alpha proton (the one on the carbon adjacent to the N) would be abstracted, forming an enamine anion.

So, after deprotonation, we have an enamine with a negative charge on the nitrogen? Or wait, LDA is a strong base, it would abstract a proton alpha to the N, leading to a conjugate base.

Once deprotonated, the enamine anion is more nucleophilic. Then, when we add ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), an alkylating agent, the enamine would attack the ethyl iodide, leading to alkylation at the alpha position.

After alkylation, we would have an additional ethyl group attached to the alpha carbon.

Then, perhaps an acidic workup (H3O+) would protonate the enamine, and upon hydrolysis (maybe under acidic or basic conditions), it would break down to form a ketone and release the amine.

Wait, but in enamine reactions, the general process is:

Enamine + Electrophile → Alkylated Enamine → Hydrolysis → Ketone (or aldehyde) + Amine.

So in this case, the starting enamine is the iminium ion. Deprotonating it makes it a stronger nucleophile, allowing alkylation. Then, after alkylation, protonating and hydrolyzing will give the product.

So, what's the structure after alkylation?

The starting iminium is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. After deprotonation at the alpha position, the double bond shifts? Or does the alkylation add a group to the alpha carbon?

Wait, let me think about the enamine structure. The enamine has the structure R2C=CH-NR'R''. When deprotonated, it's R2C-:CH-NR'R'' with a negative charge somewhere.

When ethyl iodide is added, the ethyl group would attach to the carbon adjacent to the N, the alpha carbon. So the structure becomes R2C-Et-CH-NR'R''.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the enamine after deprotonation is a conjugate base, and the ethyl iodide would add to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is that the enamine anion attacks the ethyl iodide, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha carbon and the ethyl group.

So, the starting structure is:

N(CH3)(CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3)(CH2CH3)+.

After deprotonation, the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to N) would have a lone pair, making it a nucleophile. Adding ethyl iodide would then add an ethyl group to that carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure after alkylation becomes:

N(CH3)(CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3)(CH2CH3) with an ethyl group added to the alpha carbon.

But wait, after alkylation, when we protonate and hydrolyze, the enamine breaks down. The hydrolysis would cleave the C-N bond, releasing the ketone and the amine.

So, the product would be a ketone. Let's see: the starting material's substituents are pentan-2-ylidene and ethyl groups. When the enamine is hydrolyzed, the ketone would be formed from the longest chain.

Wait, the enamine's structure is:

The starting material after deprotonation and alkylation would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. So when hydrolyzed, the ketone would be formed from the R groups attached to the C adjacent to N.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are such that when the enamine is hydrolyzed, a longer chain ketone is formed.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. After alkylation, when we hydrolyze, the ketone's position depends on where the ethyl group is added.

But let me think in terms of the product options.

Option C says B is heptan-4-one.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, heptan-4-one would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, heptan-4-one is a seven-carbon chain with a ketone at position 4.

So, positions 1 to 7:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

CH3-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, 4 would be the fourth carbon.

Wait, let me count: CH3CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3 is heptan-4-one: because the ketone is on C4 of a seven-carbon chain.

So, how would that form from the starting material?

The starting material's enamine, when hydrolyzed, would break the C-N bond, yielding a ketone. So the new ketone's chain comes from the enamine's substituents.

If the starting material's substituent is pentan-2-ylidene (five carbons), and we add an ethyl group via alkylation, then the product would have 5 + 2 = 7 carbons? Hmm, but not exactly, because the position of addition may vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, after alkylation and hydrolysis, would form a ketone with seven carbons.

Wait, the starting material's substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. Adding an ethyl group via alkylation would make the chain longer.

So, if the enamine was originally from a secondary amine and a ketone, the hydrolysis gives a ketone. But in this case, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the alpha position, making the carbon chain longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the original enamine is a five-carbon chain (pentan-2-ylidene), and after adding an ethyl group, the chain becomes seven carbons. Then, the ketone would be at position 4.

Wait, maybe the starting material's enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a four-carbon ketone. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product B is heptan-4-one, which is seven carbons with a ketone in the middle.

Looking at the options, option C says B is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So the steps would be:

1. Deprotonate with LDA in DME to form the enamine anion.

2. Alkylation with ethyl iodide.

3. Protonate with H3O+.

Wait, but after protonation, what happens? Do we need to hydrolyze further to get the ketone?

Wait, maybe the third step is hydrolysis, which would break the enamine into the ketone and the amine.

So the reagents would be:

A) (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ and maybe another step like aqueous workup?

But in the options, option C lists reagents as (i), (ii), (iii) as LDA/DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So after these steps, product B is heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, option D says B is heptan-4-one and the reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, option D's reagents are (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Which is the correct sequence?

Wait, LDA is a strong base and is typically used in a solvent like DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) or THF. So step (i) would be LDA in DME to deprotonate the iminium ion.

Then, step (ii) is the alkylation with CH3CH2I.

Then, step (iii) is H3O+ for protonation, possibly followed by hydrolysis to form the ketone.

Wait, but product B is just the ketone, which would require hydrolysis. So the sequence would include another step, perhaps, but the options don't mention that.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ → B: heptan-4-one.

Option D: (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ → B: heptan-4-one.

So in option C, step (ii) is just CH3CH2I, which is the alkylation. Then step (iii) is H3O+.

But in option D, step (ii) includes DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+. That might imply that all three are done in one pot, which doesn't make sense because you'd want to deprotonate first, then alkylate, then protonate.

So, option C's sequence makes more sense: deprotonate (LDA in DME), then add ethyl iodide, then protonate.

Thus, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Looking back at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i), (ii), (iii) as LDA/DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but another option is option D. Let me check the options again.

Option D says A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+ → B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't add DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+ all in step (ii) without first deprotonating with LDA in step (i). So perhaps option C is correct.

But wait, another angle: the starting material is an iminium ion, which when treated with LDA would deprotonate to form the enamine. Then, adding ethyl iodide would alkylate it. Then, adding H3O+ would protonate, and hydrolysis would give the ketone and the amine. So product B is the ketone.

If the starting material's enamine is from a five-carbon chain, adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. So the ketone would be heptan-4-one.

Thus, the correct product is heptan-4-one, and the reagent sequence is option C.


The reaction involves the enamine derived from (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The starting material is an iminium ion, which can undergo deprotonation, alkylation, and subsequent hydrolysis to form a ketone. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Deprotonation**: Treatment with LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) in DME deprotonates the iminium ion, forming an enamine anion. This step activates the enamine for alkylation.
   
2. **Alkylation**: The enamine anion reacts with ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I), adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon. This step extends the carbon chain.

3. **Protonation and Hydrolysis**: Acidic workup with H₃O⁺ protonates the enamine, and subsequent hydrolysis cleaves the C-N bond, yielding a ketone and releasing the amine.

The starting material's pentan-2-ylidene group contributes five carbons, and the addition of an ethyl group via alkylation results in a seven-carbon chain. Hydrolysis produces heptan-4-one, a ketone with the structure CH₃CH₂CH₂COCH₂CH₂CH₃.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because it suggests the product is pentan-2-one, which does not match the seven-carbon product formed after alkylation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it also suggests the product is pentan-2-one.
- **Option C**: Correct. The sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, leading to heptan-4-one as the product.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it implies all steps (base, alkylation, and protonation) are performed in a single pot, which is not the correct sequence.

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one.

Answer: C
