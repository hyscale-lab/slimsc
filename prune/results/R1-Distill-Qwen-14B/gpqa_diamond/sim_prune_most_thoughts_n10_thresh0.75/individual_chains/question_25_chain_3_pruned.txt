Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because name reactions can be tricky. But let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question asks about two different reactions, each with a product given, and we need to find the reactants from the options. Let's take each one at a time.

First Reaction:
A + H2SO4 → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one

Hmm, so H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. I remember that when alcohols react with H2SO4, especially under certain conditions, they can undergo oxidation. Wait, wait—oxidative reactions... Oh, oxidation of alcohols. Primary alcohols get oxidized to ketones? No, wait, primary alcohols go to aldehydes, but then further to carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones, and tertiary alcohols don't oxidize under normal conditions because they don't have an H on the OH-bearing carbon.

Looking at the product, 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one, that's a ketone. So the starting material A must have had an alcohol group that's in a position where oxidation would give a ketone. That implies that A is a secondary alcohol. So the structure of A would be 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol.

Wait, looking at the reaction conditions, H2SO4 is a strong acid. Maybe it's a dehydration reaction? But the product is a ketone, which suggests oxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed elimination, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. So oxidation is more likely.

So A is an alcohol, and when oxidized, it becomes a ketone. Therefore, A is 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A says A is 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol. Option D also mentions this for A. So either could be correct. Let's hold onto that.

Second Reaction:
B + BuLi + H+ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

BuLi is a strong base, n-butyllithium. It's often used in organometallic reactions. H+ is a proton source. Let me think about possible reactions with BuLi.

Wait, if B reacts with BuLi, which is a strong base, perhaps it's a Grignard or organometallic reaction. Alternatively, another possibility is a conjugate addition or a deprotonation followed by protonation.

Wait, the product is 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol. That structure has an alcohol group and a double bond. Let me draw it out mentally. The formula is C6H5-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-OH? No
