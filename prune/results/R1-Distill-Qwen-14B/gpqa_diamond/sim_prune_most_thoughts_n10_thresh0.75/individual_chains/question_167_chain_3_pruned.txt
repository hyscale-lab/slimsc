Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because non-Gaussianity in Schrödinger cat states isn't something I'm super familiar with. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Then, the relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho*ln rho) - trace(tau*ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

Our task is to compute the nG when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The options are A to D.

First, let me make sure I understand the setup. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are Gaussian states. But when you take their superposition with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), the overall state becomes non-Gaussian because coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and superpositions of them (especially with different phases) lead to non-Gaussian density matrices.

The non-Gaussianity is measured using relative entropy, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and that of the reference Gaussian state tau. So, nG is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is entropy.

Wait, no, the definition given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). But wait, the von Neumann entropy is S = -trace(rho ln rho). So, the given del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Which would be [ - S(rho) + S(tau) ]? Because S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho). So, del_b = (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So nG is S(rho) - S(tau) if it's defined that way. Hmm, wait the definition of nG is the relative entropy between rho and tau. But I think in some contexts, the relative entropy is D(rho || tau) = S(rho) + trace(tau ln rho). Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait the actual formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's (trace rho ln rho) - (trace tau ln tau). Which is S(rho) is -trace rho ln rho, so trace rho ln rho = - S(rho). So del_b becomes (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So for non-Gaussian states, I suppose if rho is non-Gaussian, S(rho) is higher than S(tau), making del_b negative. But wait, no, because S(rho) can be either higher or lower than S(tau), depending on the state.

Wait, but I think the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is commonly defined as S(rho) - S(tau), which would be the entropy of the state minus the entropy of the most mixed Gaussian state. So in that case, if the del_b as given is (trace rho ln rho - trace tau ln tau) = (-S(rho)) - (-S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So if nG is S(rho) - S(tau), then nG would be the negative of del_b. Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines del_b as the quantity to use as nG
