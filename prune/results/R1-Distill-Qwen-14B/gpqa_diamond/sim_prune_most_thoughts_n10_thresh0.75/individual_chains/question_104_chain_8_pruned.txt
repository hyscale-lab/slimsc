Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, both planets are roughly the same mass. The planets' orbits are circular.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I'm supposed to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, what's the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So, K is the semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (as the star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit).

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (something else? Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ), but with some constants involved. But maybe sin i is close to 1 for most cases, as the orbits are edge-on, which is typical for RV detection.

Wait, but both planets have the same mass and same star mass, so M_planet is same, M_star same. Therefore, the only variable here is P, the orbital period. So K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, since M_p and M_* are the same for both stars, the ratio of their K shifts should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

So, K1 / K2 = sqrt( (P2)/(P1) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, let me think again. Let's denote:

K = (some constants) * (M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_* are same for both, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1/K2 = [P2/P1]^(1/3)? Wait, no, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3
