Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and the spectral lines shift wavelengths periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so Kepler's laws should apply here.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method detects the velocity of the star, which relates to the amplitude of the Doppler shift. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (P planet)^(-1/3) over (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(2/3), but wait, since the planet masses are given as similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (like Sun), so 1 + (M_p/M_s) â‰ˆ 1, so maybe M_planet is negligible here. So K would be approximately proportional to (P)^(-1/3).

But wait, what's K? K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum velocity observed. The wavelength shift is related to velocity. The Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So higher delta lambda means higher velocity.

So, for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the velocity shift. So K1 is proportional to 5 milliangstroms, K2 to 7.

Wait, more accurately, the Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. So if I have two shifts, delta_lambda1 and delta_lambda2, then K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2, because c and lambda are the same for the same spectral line. So K1 = (5/7) K2.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the same star emits the same spectral line, so for each star, the shift depends on their velocities. So for each planet, the K is proportional to the velocity of the star.

But wait, the question says that planet #1 caused a shift of 5, planet #2 a shift of 7. So K1 = 5, K2 =7 in milliangstrom. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But since K is related to (M_p / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (P)^( -1/3 ), but wait I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The RV method equation is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star,
