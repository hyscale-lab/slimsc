Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the resulting NMR spectra. Let me break this down.

First, the reaction conditions: Compound X reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Wait, right, when an alkene reacts with an epoxidizing agent like this, it forms an epoxide. So the product should be an epoxide.

So, Compound X probably has a double bond that's reacting to form an epoxide. So, X is maybe an alkene that, upon epoxidation, forms the product.

Looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's focus on the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, 2 singlets for 3H each. Those are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, like in a structure where each methyl is attached to an aromatic ring or something else that doesn't cause splitting.

The aromatic region has four signals. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Wait, let's parse that. Maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing these signals.

In the 13C NMR, the signals are:

21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

The 197.7 is a carbonyl, probably an epoxide. Because epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the 13C NMR for an epoxide's carbons are typically around 50-70 ppm. Wait, but the 197 ppm is way higher. Hmm, maybe that's the carbonyl from an ester or ketone? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl? Wait, but the product came from epoxidation, so maybe the 197 ppm is an epoxide? Or did I get that wrong.

Wait, no, I think the epoxide carbons are typically in the 50s. So 197 might be something else. Wait, maybe it's the carbonyl from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Let me think: for an epoxide, each oxygen is attached to two carbons, so they would be around 50-60 ppm. So 197 is way too high; that's more like a carbonyl in a ketone or an ester. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide, so the epoxide carbons should show up around 50-60 ppm. The 197 is a carbonyl, but that's not expected for an epoxide. So maybe I'm missing something else. Or perhaps the 197 is an epoxide? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't epoxidation? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction conditions.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. It's used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which typically uses a peracid, but sometimes other oxidizing agents can be used. Or wait, no, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? No, wait, the product is formed from reacting X with this base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation, where an alkene in
