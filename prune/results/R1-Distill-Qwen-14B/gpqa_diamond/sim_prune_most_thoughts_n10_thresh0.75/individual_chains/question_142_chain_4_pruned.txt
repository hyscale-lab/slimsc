Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are four points in a 3D space, so these are vectors r with three components.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but mixed states are combinations of these.

Wait, the given rho looks like it's a mixture of |0><0| and |1><1|. Let me compute what rho looks like in matrix form. So, |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (1,1). Adding them together gives a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, we get a matrix where each diagonal element is 1/2, and the off-diagonals are zero. So rho is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Right, that's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation.

Oh, right! For a single qubit state, any density matrix can be represented by a point on or inside the Bloch sphere. The density matrix rho can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z).

Wait, so the general form is rho = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, I is the identity matrix.

Given rho is ( |0><0| + |1><1| ) / 2, I can write it as:

rho = (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]]

Which is equal to (I)/2. So substituting into the general form,

rho = (I + r·σ ) / 2.

So, I = (I + r·σ)/2 * 2? Wait, wait. Let's compute:

rho = [I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z ] / 2.

But our rho is I/2. So,

I/2 = [I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z ] / 2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z.

Each of the Pauli matrices is separate, so each coefficient must be zero. So x=0, y=0, z=0.

Because, for example, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the only way x σ_x is zero matrix is if x=0. Similarly for y and z.

So r is (0, 0, 0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check. For a completely mixed state, the density matrix is maximally mixed, which for a qubit is I/2. And this corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere,
