Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm, let's see what the question says. So, a scientist is running quantitative PCR and made a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. His Ct values for different concentrations are given.

Wait, what's a calibration curve in qPCR? Oh right, it's a standard curve made from known concentrations of a nucleic acid. The Ct values are plotted against the log of the starting quantity. Then, you can use this curve to quantify unknown samples by their Ct.

So the efficiency is 100%, which is perfect. R squared of 1 means the data perfectly fits the curve. So the technical replicates must be very consistent because the standard error is low. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember the expected slope when efficiency is 100% (or close to it) is about -3.32 because of the logarithmic relationship. So that's correct here.

Now, looking at the data. For each concentration, there are three Ct values. Let's see: 100000 copies, Cts are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average might be about 34.2. Then at 10000, the Cts are 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average around 31. Then 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. 27.6 on average. 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. 24.3. 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. 21.

Wait, I'm trying to see if there's any pattern in the Ct values. Each dilution is 10-fold. So 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold dilution (divide by 10), and the Ct goes from ~34 to ~31. Difference is about 3.3 cycles. Hmm, the slope is -3.3, which aligns with the expected 10-fold change per 3.3 Ct difference. So that makes sense.

But wait, what's the question? The question is about the discrepancies in the results. So the options are suggesting some problem with the data. But the efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, so the curve is perfect. But looking at the Ct values, are they as expected?

Wait, let's think about each step. So when you dilute a sample 10-fold, you should see a Ct increase of about 3.3 cycles. Because each 10-fold dilution reduces the starting quantity by 10, and with
