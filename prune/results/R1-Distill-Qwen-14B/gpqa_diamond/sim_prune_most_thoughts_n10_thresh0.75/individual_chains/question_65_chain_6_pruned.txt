Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B based on the given reagents. Then, I choose the correct option from the options A to D.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base. Maybe it's used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. Wait, the starting material is an alcohol with a spiro structure and a vinyl group. So the molecule has a spiro ring system—like two rings connected at a single atom. The structure is 1-vinyl, so the vinyl group is attached to the spiro center.

In the first part, the reagent is KH in THF. Then, after that, they add H+. So maybe it's a deprotonation followed by something else. Since the starting material is a secondary or tertiary alcohol? Let me think. The spiro structure would mean the alcohol is attached to a bridgehead. Wait, bridgehead alcohols can undergo elimination reactions, especially with strong bases. So perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination.

Wait, but what's the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol? Let me visualize it. Spiro[3.5]non means two rings: one is 3-membered and the other 5-membered, connected at one carbon (the 1-position). So the structure is a bridge where the 1-position is connected to both rings. The 1-position has a hydroxyl group (since it's a spiro alcohol) and a vinyl group (CH2-CH2 maybe? Or CH=CH2? Wait, 1-vinyl would be CH2=CH– attached to the spiro center.

So the molecule is a spiro compound with a bridge, and a double bond in the five-membered ring (non-5-en). So, when we treat with a strong base like KH, which is a source of H- (hyd
