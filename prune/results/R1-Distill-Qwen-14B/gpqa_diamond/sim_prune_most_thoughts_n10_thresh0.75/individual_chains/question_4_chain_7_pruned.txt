Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't have a single isolated pole. But if that's not the case here, how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Let me think. Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to each other and to charges and currents. I remember them as:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is proportional to the charge density.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is proportional to the negative rate of change of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is proportional to the current density plus the displacement current.

Wait, but in our universe, Gauss's Law for Magnetism says that the divergence of B is zero, which implies that magnetic monopoles don't exist. Because if they did, the divergence wouldn't be zero—there would be sources and sinks of magnetic field lines.

So the question is, if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean that magnetic monopoles exist. Therefore, the equation governing the divergence of B must change. Because in our case, without monopoles, ∇·B = 0. But with monopoles, ∇·B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how ∇·E relates to electric charge density.

Wait, but which equations would change? Let me look at the options. The options are about which of Maxwell's equations are different.

In our universe:

- The divergence of B is zero (equation 2). So that would change if monopoles exist.
- The other equations might also change. Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law might also involve additional terms.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become modified. In such a scenario, both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Ampère's Law (or Faraday's) would change.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Without monopoles, we have:

∇·B = 0 (Gauss's Law for magnetism
