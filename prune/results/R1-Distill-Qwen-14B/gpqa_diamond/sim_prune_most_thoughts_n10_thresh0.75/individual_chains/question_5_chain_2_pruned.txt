Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2.

First, I need to understand what's given. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Wait, the operator we're considering is P along the direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, meaning it doesn't have any y-component. So n would be something like (a, 0, b), where a and b are real numbers, and a² + b² = 1.

The operator P is given as a vector operator, so P = n · σ * ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But wait, actually, each component is given, so P is P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z. But wait, no, the way the problem is presented, P is a vector operator whose components are given as separate matrices. So the operator P along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's components. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since the direction n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector. So n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me denote n_x as 'a' and n_z as 'b' for simplicity. So a² + b² =1.

So the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute it.

P = a*(ħ/2) * [[
