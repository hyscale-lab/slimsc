Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector with three components. So this must be a qutrit system, which means each observable has three possible states. Or maybe it's a three-level system. I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space, and observables are represented by matrices.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let's look at them. 

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix, which makes it easier because its eigenvalues are just the diagonal elements. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, or -1.

The question asks: what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. No, the question says, someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is first P, then Q. So the measurements are done in that order.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first measuring P would collapse the state into an eigenstate of P. Then measuring Q on this new state would give the probability for each eigenvalue of Q.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The first measurement is P, and we're interested in the case where P's outcome is 0 and Q's outcome is -1. So we need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then measuring Q gives -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is phrased, it's the joint probability: the probability that when you measure P first, you get 0, and then measure Q and get -1.

Wait, but to compute that, I think I need to find the state after measuring P and getting 0, and then compute the probability of Q being -1 in that state.

So the process would be:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue you get.

2. The initial state is |ψ>, so the probability of getting eigenvalue 0 for P is the square of the amplitude when |ψ> is projected onto the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but wait. Wait, P's matrix isn't diagonal, so
