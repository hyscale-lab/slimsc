Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the question is about a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by the refractive index. So in this case, the speed of light in the glass should be c/n. But wait, c is given as 1 here. So light speed in the glass is 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So does that affect the observed speed?

Oh, right! There's something about how velocities add when objects are moving relative to each other. Like in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, in this case, I'm not sure if that applies. Because the medium itself is moving, and the light is within that medium. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us at v. The light inside the glass is moving at speed v_light_glass = 1/n relative to the glass. So what's the speed relative to the lab?

So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But the glass is moving towards the lab at v. So from the lab, the speed of the light would be 1/n + v? Wait, that can't be right, because velocities don't just add like that when dealing with significant fractions of the speed of light. But wait, in this problem, are we assuming non-relativistic speeds? Or does it require using relativistic addition?

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v. But it doesn't specify if v is small or not. Hmm. But the options given don't look like the relativistic addition formula. Let me check the options.

Option B is 1. So that would be the speed of light in a vacuum, which doesn't make sense because the light is inside the glass. So that's probably not right unless
