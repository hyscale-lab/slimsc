Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

The given Lagrangian includes terms like i bar(N_R) gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which looks like a kinetic term for a fermion. Then there's (1/2)(partial phi)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar phi. The next term is |D^mu S|^2, which suggests that S is a scalar field with a covariant derivative, so it's probably charged or in a non-trivial representation. 

The interaction terms are -y_i/2 phi bar(N_{iR})^c N_{iR}^c. Wait, that's interesting. So phi is interacting with the right-handed neutrinos N_{iR}, and it's a Yukawa-like term. Also, there's another term, -g_{i alpha} bar(N_{iR}) L_alpha S. So the N's are interacting with the lepton doublets L and the scalar S. And then the potential V(phi, S, H), which I'm not entirely sure about, but H must be another scalar field.

The fields' representations are given: N_iR are singlets, so they have (1,1,0) under (SU(2)_L, SU(3)_C, U(1)_Y). S is a scalar doublet, (1,2,1), so it's an SU(2) doublet, and phi is a singlet scalar (1,1,0). 

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) is given as <phi>^2 = x^2 + v^2, with <phi> = x and <h> = v. Wait, wait, h is another field? Or is phi being expanded around a VEV? Maybe phi is one of the fields in the Higgs sector. Oh, wait, perhaps H is another scalar, like the Higgs. But the potential V is a function of phi, S, and H. Hmm.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. So I need to think about how radiative corrections affect the mass of this boson.

Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken but not completely. For example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field breaks the SU(2) symmetry, and the Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the W and Z bosons. But in some extensions, like with additional scalars, you might have additional Goldstone modes that don't get eaten, hence pseudo-Goldstone.

But wait, in this case, the question is about H2. I'm guessing that H2 is one of the CP-odd Higgs bosons or a CP-even one, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pseudo-Goldstone from the breaking of some global symmetry, like in Type I seesaw models
