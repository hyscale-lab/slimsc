Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see what I can figure out.

So, the question says that the supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so that's like the relative velocity between them.

The problem asks what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, so we're dealing with time dilation here because the frames are moving relative to each other.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The key here is to determine the relationship between the time in the two frames. Since the ejecta and Galaxy are moving relative to each other, their time measurements will differ. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, what's the time in the Galaxy's frame?

I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where t' is the dilated time (Galaxy frame) and t is the proper time (ejecta frame). Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think I might have that backwards. Let me get this straight.

In special relativity, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (like the start and end of the time interval) happen at the same place. So, if the ejecta's frame measures 50 seconds between two events that happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, which is moving relative to the ejecta, the time would be longer. So t (Galaxy) = gamma * t' (ejecta).

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the velocity given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into meters per second because the standard SI units are better for calculations. Oh wait, but wait, do I need to? Maybe, but let me check what 60,000 km/s is in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,
