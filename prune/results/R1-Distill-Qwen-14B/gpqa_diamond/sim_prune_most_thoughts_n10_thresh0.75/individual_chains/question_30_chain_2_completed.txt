Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think through this.

The question says that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when an electron gets excited, it jumps to a higher energy level, and when it drops back, it emits a photon. So the energy of that emitted photon relates to the wavelength of light, right?

Oh, right! The energy and wavelength are inversely related. The formula I recall is E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, and lower energy means longer wavelength.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. So the emitted light is the one we're seeing, like fluorescence. So the absorbed light is the complementary color.

So first, I need to find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV. Let's calculate that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, energy in eV is easier to handle with a different approach. Oh yeah, there's a shortcut formula for converting eV to wavelength in nanometers.

I think the conversion is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E(eV). So plugging in E=2.3393 eV, λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's see, 1240 divided by around 2.34. Let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.34. Let me do that: 2.34 times 500 is 1170, 2.34 *529 ≈ 1239.66. Hmm, wait, wait, actually 2.34 times 529 is approximately 1240, so 1240 /2.34 ≈ 529 nm. So the wavelength is approximately 529 nm.

What color is that? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 (violet) to 700 (red) nm. The colors go ROYGBIV: Red (~700), Orange (~610), Yellow (~580), Green (~530), Blue (~470), Indigo (~440), Violet (~400). So 529 is close to 530, which is green. So the emitted light is green.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. Oh right, because when something emits a certain color, it means it absorbed the complementary color. Because the color we see is what's emitted, but the dye must have absorbed the other wavelengths and only emitted this one.

So the color wheel: green is in the middle. The complementary color to green would be magenta or something, but wait, the options are only Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow. Hmm. Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy absorbed. Wait, no, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, which is 529 nm (green), so the dye must have absorbed higher energy (shorter wavelength) light to reach that excited state. Or wait, no, no, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited. The energy of the emitted photon would be less than the absorbed one, right? Because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Wait, no, wait. The process is: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron to a higher energy state. Then, when the electron drops back to a lower state, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon depends on the energy difference between the two states.

In fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one because the molecule loses some energy to the environment (like heat). So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed photon must have higher energy, i.e., shorter wavelength, which would be blue or violet.

Wait, so the dye absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light and emits lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the emitted is green (529 nm), the absorbed would be higher energy, maybe blue or violet.

Wait, the options are Violet (B), Blue (C), Red (A), Yellow (D). So possible options are B or C.

But wait, the question says "What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" So the absorbed light is higher in energy than the emitted. So the absorbed wavelength is shorter than 529 nm.

Let me think about the colors. Violet is around 400-440, blue around 450-500, green 500-570. So if the emitted is 529, which is green, the absorbed would be higher in energy (lower wavelength), which would be blue or violet.

So the options are B (violet) or C (blue). Now, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Let's compute the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe there's another approach. The relationship between energy and color is: higher energy (shorter wavelength) corresponds to colors on the blue side of the spectrum.

Since the emitted light is green (around 529 nm), the absorbed light must be of higher energy than that. So higher than 529 nm? No, higher energy is lower wavelength. Wait, higher energy is lower wavelength. So 529 nm is green, the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than that, so higher energy.

So the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet region.

Now, considering the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Which one is it? Well, sometimes the colors can be a bit ambiguous, but let's think about the energy difference.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed energy is higher. Let's say if the absorbed wavelength is, say, 450 nm (blue), then the energy would be E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

Alternatively, if the absorbed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), E =1240 /400 =3.1 eV.

So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon is higher energy, either blue or violet.

But the question is which color is absorbed. So the possible options are B and C.

But the question is, which color is absorbed. So the dye absorbs that color, and emits another.

Wait, I think I'm making this more complicated. Let me think again. When a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of the photon matches the energy gap between two states. The emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 529 nm.

So the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet region.

But the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which one has a wavelength shorter than 529? Both B and C, but violet is shorter than blue. Because blue is around 450-495 nm, and violet is 380-450 nm.

Wait, no, wait. Correction: violet is shorter wavelength than blue. So if the emitted is 529 nm (green), the absorbed must be a higher energy (shorter wavelength) photon, so the absorbed would be either blue or violet.

Which color is higher in energy? Violet.

So the compound absorbs violet light, which is higher energy than green.

Alternatively, if the compound absorbs blue, which is lower energy than violet but higher than green.

Wait, but the problem is that the exact energy of the absorbed photon isn't given. So perhaps the question is designed so that the emitted wavelength is green, so the absorbed is blue. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The color we see is the color that's emitted, but the color absorbed is the complement. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong earlier. Because the color absorbed is the one that the molecule doesn't emit. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color, which is magenta. But the options don't have magenta. So perhaps the question is not about complementary colors but about the absorbed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the absorbed light, which is the one that the dye doesn't emit. Wait, no, that's not right. The dye absorbs a certain wavelength (which it doesn't emit), but emits another. So the emitted light is green, which suggests that the dye absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), causing the emission of green.

So the absorbed light is of higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 529 nm.

Which of the options have a wavelength shorter than 529 nm? Violet is around 400-440, which is shorter than 529. Blue is around 450-500, which is also shorter than 529 but longer than violet.

So violet has a shorter wavelength than blue. So if the absorbed photon is in the violet range, its energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. If it's blue, it's still higher than 2.3393 but less than violet.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy of the absorbed photon, can I figure it out?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of which color has higher energy than green. Green is around 529 nm, which is about 2.34 eV. So any color with a wavelength shorter than 529 would have higher energy. So blue (around 450-500, 2.48-2.75 eV) and violet (400-450, 2.75-3.1 eV) would be higher.

So the question is, which color is the absorbed one. The options are Violet and Blue.

But the question doesn't give any more info, so perhaps the answer is Violet because it's higher in energy than green.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Another approach: when a substance emits fluorescence, the emitted photon is usually lower in energy than the absorbed one. So if the dye emits green (2.34 eV), it must have absorbed a photon with higher energy than that. So the absorbed photon could be blue (2.48 eV) or violet (2.75 eV).

So the possible options are B and C. But which one?

Hmm. Maybe the question is looking for the color that would correspond to a higher energy than green. Since blue is around 2.48 eV and violet around 2.75, both are higher than 2.34.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the answer is violet because it's higher. Or maybe the energy required for green emission comes from the absorption of blue.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy difference. The energy of the emitted photon is given. If the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, and then emits a photon of E_emit=2.34 eV. So E_abs = E_emit + (energy lost as heat or other processes). So E_abs is greater than 2.34 eV.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.34 eV, so wavelength is less than 529 nm. So it's either violet or blue.

But the options are B and C, so which one is it?

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, so that's the energy of the photon emitted. The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so higher in energy than 2.3393 eV, so shorter wavelength.

But without knowing the exact energy of the absorbed photon, perhaps the question is expecting us to recognize that the emitted color is green, so the absorbed is the complementary color, which would be magenta, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the color absorbed being the one with higher energy.

Wait, another angle. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Since energy and wavelength are inversely proportional, the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy. So the emitted light is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed light would be on the higher energy side, i.e., blue or violet.

But the only options are A: red, B: violet, C: blue, D: yellow.

So the absorbed color is either B or C.

But the question is, which one is it? Well, sometimes in these questions, the emitted color is the one that's not absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it's because it absorbed the higher energy (blue or violet) and emitted green.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than emitted.

So, since the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed is higher than that.

Looking at the options, violet is higher (E ~3 eV), blue is about 2.5-2.8 eV.

But without the exact absorption wavelength, perhaps the answer is violet (B) as the absorbed color.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the energy difference. Suppose the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. If the absorbed photon was, say, blue (450 nm), that's E=2.755 eV. So the energy difference is 2.755 - 2.3393 = 0.415 eV. That could be a possible scenario.

Alternatively, if the absorbed photon is violet (400 nm, E=3.1 eV), the difference is larger.

But without knowing the exact energy gap, perhaps the answer is violet, as it's a higher energy than green.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the question is designed such that the emitted light is green, which is around 529 nm, so the absorbed is blue (since blue is higher energy than green). Wait, no. Green has lower energy than blue. Because blue is around 470 nm, which is lower than 529 nm, so higher energy.

Wait, 470 nm is blue, higher energy than green (529), so if the absorbed is blue, which is higher energy than green, then the emitted would be green. That makes sense.

So if the dye absorbs blue (470 nm, E≈2.64 eV), then emits green (529 nm, E≈2.34 eV). That would fit.

But the question is, what color is absorbed. So the answer would be blue, option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me recap:

- Emitted photon energy: 2.3393 eV → wavelength ~529 nm (green)
- Absorbed photon energy must be higher → wavelength <529 nm → color could be blue or violet.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the options are B (violet) and C (blue).

So the question is, which one is it.

Since I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should think about typical fluorescent dyes. Fluorescent dyes like GFP emit green light when excited by blue light. So in that case, the absorbed light is blue, and emitted is green.

So in that scenario, the answer would be Blue (option C).

But in the question, the emitted is green, so the absorbed is blue. So the correct answer would be Blue, option C.

Wait, but wait. Blue has a higher energy than green, so when a molecule absorbs blue, it can emit green. Because blue is higher in energy than green.

So yeah, the absorbed light is blue, and emitted is green.

So the answer is option C, Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{E} \, \text{(in nm)}.
\]

Substituting \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 529 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum (400–700 nm), where green is approximately 529 nm.

Next, we consider the energy of the absorbed light. Fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, excites an electron to a higher energy state, and then emits a photon of lower energy as the electron returns to its ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon.

The energy of the absorbed photon is related to its wavelength by the same formula \( E = \frac{1240}{\lambda} \). Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, its wavelength must be shorter than 529 nm. This places the absorbed light in the blue or violet regions of the spectrum, as these correspond to wavelengths shorter than green.

To distinguish between blue and violet, we note the typical energy ranges:
- Blue light: ~450–500 nm (2.48–2.75 eV),
- Violet light: ~400–450 nm (2.75–3.1 eV).

Both blue and violet have higher energy than green (2.3393 eV), but the question does not provide additional details about the exact energy of the absorbed photon. However, in many fluorescence processes, blue light (around 470 nm) is commonly absorbed to emit green light. This aligns with the scenario where the dye absorbs blue light and emits green light.

Thus, the absorbed light is most likely blue.
