Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I need to find the energy levels from the options provided.

First, I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can often be separated into radial and angular parts. Let me look at the given potential. It's V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, I can factor out r², so that's V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, but maybe I should think about whether this potential can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates and whether it's separable. Because in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is usually expressed in terms of r and θ. If the potential is separable, then the solution might be a product of radial and angular parts.

Let me rewrite the potential to see if it's separable. Wait, cos²θ is a function of θ only, so maybe I can write this as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ] * (k r²). Wait, but that's ( (1 + 3 cos²θ ) / 2 ) * (k r² ). Hmm, but that's not straightforwardly separable because it's involving cos²θ multiplied by r².

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions each involving r and θ separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential in terms of a shifted or transformed coordinate system. Let me think about the angular part. The term cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in
