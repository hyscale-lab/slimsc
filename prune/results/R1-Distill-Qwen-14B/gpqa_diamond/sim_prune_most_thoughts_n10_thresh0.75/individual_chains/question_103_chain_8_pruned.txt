Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence would give a high yield of the desired product.

Let me first sketch out the structure of the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, position 5 has a nitro group, and position 1 (which is ortho to 3) has a ketone group (ethan-1-one is a ketone, right? So, it's a carbonyl attached to the ring).

Wait, benzene rings are numbered in such a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, but wait, that's more than one possibility for numbering. Oh wait, maybe the positions are 3 and 5 in the ring, but when numbering, the positions would be arranged so that the substituents get the lowest numbers.

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring. Let me imagine the ring positions. Let's say the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo would be at position 3, and nitro at position 5? Because 3 and 5 are meta to each other relative to position 1. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (two positions away), and the nitro at position 5 (four positions away? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. The numbering would be such that the substituents are as close as possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, if you have the ketone at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3 (which is meta to position 1
