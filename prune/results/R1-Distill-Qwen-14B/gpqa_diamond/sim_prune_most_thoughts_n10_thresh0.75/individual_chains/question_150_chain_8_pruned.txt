Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, along with a series of reactions, and I need to figure out what the final product is. The options are all different aldehydes or something similar, so knowing the reaction steps is crucial.

First, I'll try to interpret the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet (t, 1H). High ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton, but wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm as a singlet because they don't have any neighboring hydrogens. But here it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's something else, like an acidic proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton in a conjugated system.

Next peak is at 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H). That's probably aromatic protons. Since it's a doublet, maybe they're adjacent to substituents. Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d, 2H), also aromatic. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, maybe on para positions of a benzene ring. Then 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe an exchangeable proton, like an -OH group, but this is a singlet with two hydrogens. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents that cause some symmetry.

The last peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H). This seems like a pair of hydrogens attached to something, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen or nitrogen.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, degrees of unsaturation: each double bond or ring counts as one. Let me calculate that. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is9, X is 0, N is1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be, say, one ring, one double bond (like an aldehyde), and maybe another ring or another double bond? Wait, perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), a double bond (1), and then an amide or something else (maybe a ring? Or another double bond?) Wait, but let's think.

Wait, the NMR has some aliphatic and aromatic signals. Let me think about the structure. If there's a benzene ring, that's 4 C and 1 degree (wait, no, benzene is 3 degrees because it's 3 double bonds). So for the formula, the starting material has C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

Another approach: the reaction steps. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually used for diazotization, but wait, in what contexts? Diazonium salts are often formed from aromatic amines, like aniline derivatives. But wait, the starting material has an N, but the formula is C8H9NO. So N is present as one atom. So maybe an aromatic amine, like a phenyl group attached to a CH2NH2 or something? Or maybe a secondary amine? Alternatively, could it be an amide?

Wait, the initial structure's formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the molecular formula. Suppose we have a benzene ring (6 C, 6 H). Then, the remaining is C2H3NO. Hmm, but wait,
