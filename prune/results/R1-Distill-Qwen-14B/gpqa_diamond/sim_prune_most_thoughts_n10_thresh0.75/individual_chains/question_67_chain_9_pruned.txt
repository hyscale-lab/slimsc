Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we're dealing with two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So l1 and l2 are both 1 each.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I'm a little confused about what this notation means. Oh right, I think this is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and M is its z-component. So here, L is 2 because adding the two l's (each 1) gives a maximum of 2 (1+1). And M is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L_{1z} and L_{2z} for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ. So each electron's Lz is measured, and both should be -ħ. 

Hmm. So, each electron has its own Lz. For electron 1, L1z, and electron 2, L2z. The state is a coupled state, so it's about their combined angular momentum.

Wait, normally for two particles, the state is a product state in terms of individual spins, but here they're coupled. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² and L_z. But in terms of the individual angular momenta L1 and L2, how is it expressed?

I remember that the total angular momentum L is the sum of L1 and L2. So L = L1 + L2. Therefore, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is an eigenstate of L_z, which is L1z + L2z. 

So the state |1,1,2,-1> means that L_z has eigenvalue -ħ, because M is -1. So L_z |...> = (-ħ) |...>.

But the question is about measuring each L1z and L2z. So when we measure L1z and L2z, what are the possible outcomes, and what is the probability that both are -ħ?

Wait, each L1z and L2z can take values mħ, where m can be -1, 0, +1 for each since l=1.

So for each electron, possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The problem is asking for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, their sum m1 + m2 must equal the total M, which is -1. Because L_z = L1z + L2z, so M is the eigenvalue for L_z. In this state, M is -1, so m1 + m2 = -1.

If both m1 and m2 are -1, then their sum is -2. But that's not equal to M
