Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, I remember that molecular formulas can help determine the structure. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by the formula: Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (but wait, aldehyde is a double bond so that's another one, but that would be too many. Hmm, maybe a benzene ring (4), a double bond from an enal or something, and maybe an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. Oh wait, no, wait. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But the triplet here—maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, sometimes an acidic proton like an enol might show up around there, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe two phenyl groups, each para-substituted. But wait, the integration is 2H each, so maybe each is a doublet of a benzene ring with two protons each—like two identical substituents on a benzene ring. Or perhaps each is a para-substituted group on a different ring.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H), which is a broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group or something acidic. But wait, if it's a singlet integrating two protons, maybe it's a conjugated system, like a diene or something else. Or perhaps it's protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an enol form. Or maybe it's a -CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, but that might not explain the broadness.

Then 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet integrating for two protons. That could be a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe an -OCH2- group or a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2- group adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two aromatic rings (since each is showing 2H as doublets for the substituents), and a conjugated system. The aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde, but wait, the triplet. Wait, an aldehyde is usually a singlet, but maybe it's coupled with another proton. Or perhaps it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that wouldn't have a proton.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. The NMR might fit that structure. Let me think: the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. For cinnamaldehyde, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each for two H. Because the substituents are in the para positions
