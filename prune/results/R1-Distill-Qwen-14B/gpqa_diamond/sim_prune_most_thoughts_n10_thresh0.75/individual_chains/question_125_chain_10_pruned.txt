Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². I remember that this kind of potential is the 3D version of the harmonic oscillator, which is a common problem in quantum mechanics. The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all three directions, so the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, in 3D, each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, I've heard that in such cases, the energy levels can be characterized by a single quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy simplifies to E = (n + 3/2) ħω. That makes sense because each direction contributes equally in the isotropic case.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state, first excited, etc. The ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0). The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. But wait, I should clarify: in the 3D case, the energy depends on n, so each n gives a different energy level. But how do the excited states work?

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. For each n, the number of states with the same n is the number of ways you can have n_x + n_y + n_z = n, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. This is similar to combinations with repetition.
