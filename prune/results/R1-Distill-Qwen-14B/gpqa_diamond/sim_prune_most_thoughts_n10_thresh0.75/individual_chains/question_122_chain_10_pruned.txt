Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem says that acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Then product 1 is formed. I remember that when you have acetic acid reacting with something involving bromine and pyridine, it's probably an acetylation reaction. Oh wait, acetic anhydride is a common acetylating agent. So acetic acid might be acting as a nucleophile here. Wait, but pyridine is often used as a catalyst or to absorb HBr in such reactions. So maybe what's happening is the acetylation of something. Oh! Wait, maybe it's the formation of an acyl bromide. Because acetic anhydride can react with bromine to form an acid bromide. Or perhaps it's an acetylation of the acidic hydrogens, like the -OH in acetic acid. Oh, right! When you treat acetic acid with acetic anhydride and a base like pyridine, it's usually an acetylation of the hydroxyl group. So the product would be ethyl acetate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. Acetylation of the -OH would replace the -OH with an acetate group. Wait, but acetic acid is already CH3COOH; maybe this is a Fried
