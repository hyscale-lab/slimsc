Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name is a bit complicated, but I'll try to parse it. So, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down: there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. And then, on the same cyclohexane ring, there's a carbaldehyde group. So the structure probably has two substituents on the cyclohexane: one is a cyclohexyl(methanol) group (since hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH), and the other is a formyl group (CHO).

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2 group that has an OH. So the substituent is -(CH2-OH)-cyclohexyl. So, overall, the molecule has two substituents on the cyclohexane: one is a formyl (CHO) at position 1 (or wherever), and another substituent at position 1 is a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no, actually, the substituent is a cyclohexyl-(hydroxymethyl) group. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and the hydroxymethyl is attached to a cyclohexyl group, which is then attached to the main ring. So the main ring has a substituent, which is a cyclohexyl-CH2OH group attached to it. And also, the main ring has a CHO group.

But let me think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. So the starting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond to a CH2 group? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C- attached to what? Oh, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C- attached to the ring. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the triple bond is between the cyclohexane carbon and the next carbon, which is attached to H.

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane, what reactions can I perform to build up the target molecule? The target
