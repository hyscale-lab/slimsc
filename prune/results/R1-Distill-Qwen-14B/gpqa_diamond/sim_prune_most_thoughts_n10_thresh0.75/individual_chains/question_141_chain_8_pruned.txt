Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic chemistry.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, the "d" here probably indicates a deuterium. So the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Now, when you have a benzene ring with substituents, especially when using a strong base like NaNH2, I think it's about elimination reactions, maybe forming a benzene ring with a double bond. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction?

Wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation, especially for aromatic rings. So if we have a bromide attached to a benzene ring, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the bromine is at position 1, and position 2 has a deuterium. So the ring has Br at C1 and D at C2.

In such a case, when treated with NaNH2, which is a strong
