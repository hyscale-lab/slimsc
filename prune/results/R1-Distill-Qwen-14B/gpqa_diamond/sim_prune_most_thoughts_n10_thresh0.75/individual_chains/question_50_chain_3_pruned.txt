Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process. Each loop brings in an integral that needs to be evaluated, and the complexity increases with the number of loops.

The question is about figuring out how many loops the diagram has based on the given expression for "size estimate." The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

I need to break this down. So, Feynman diagrams with more loops generally have higher-order contributions. Each loop adds a factor that depends on the coupling constants and possibly other terms.

Wait, I'm trying to recall dimensional analysis or how loop integrals contribute to the overall scaling. Each loop integral typically brings in a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) in four dimensions because of the integration measure in loop momentum. But sometimes it's (4 pi)^epsilon where epsilon is from dimensional regularization, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in dimensional regularization, the loop integrals often result in factors like (4 pi)^epsilon, but when you have multiple loops, the powers would add up. Alternatively, when you compute a loop integral in 4 dimensions, you get factors like 1/(16 pi^2) per loop. So, for L loops, it's (1/(16 pi^2))^L.

Looking at the given expression, I see a (4 pi)^6 in the denominator. Let me compute that: (4 pi)^6 = 4^6 * pi^6 = 4096 pi^6. The denominator is (4 pi)^6, so the factor is 1/(4 pi)^6.

Wait, but each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor. So, for each loop, you have 1/(4^2 pi^2), which is 1/(16 pi^2). So, for L loops, you get (1/(16 pi^2))^L = 1/( (4 pi)^{2L} ) ). 

In the given expression, the denominator is (4 pi)^6. So 2L = 6? That would mean L = 3 loops. Oh, wait, that makes sense. So if each loop contributes a
