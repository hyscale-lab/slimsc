Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detected via quasars. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and when it passes through intergalactic medium, some wavelengths are absorbed. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha absorption line is at about 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen.

Wait, but how does redshift come into play here? Oh right, when the hydrogen is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength we observe is stretched. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But wait, the question is about detecting these clouds with optical ground-based telescopes. So what's the limit here? Optical telescopes typically observe in wavelengths that are visible to the human eye, which is about 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission (which is in the UV) would be redshifted into the optical range for us to detect it.

Wait, but in this case, the hydrogen is absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs the Lyman-alpha wavelength. So the absorption line we see is at a longer wavelength (due to redshift) if the cloud is moving away.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z such that the Lyman-alpha absorption can still be in the optical range. Because if z is too low, the observed wavelength would be in UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see—they’re blocked by Earth's atmosphere. So we need the Lyman-alpha line to be redshifted into the optical.

So let's compute the minimal z where the redshifted wavelength equals the lower end of optical, like maybe around 4000 Angstroms or 400 nm? Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. But optical typically starts at about 400 nm. So if the observed wavelength is at least 400 nm, then z+1 must be such that 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, let me calculate that. So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216. Let me compute that.

1216 is approximately 1.216e3 Angstroms. So 4000 / 1216 is roughly 3.29. So 1 + z >= 3.29, so z >= 2.29. So approximately z=2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above that. Option D is 1.9, which would give a wavelength of 1216 * (2.9) = around 3526 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the UV (since optical starts at about 400 nm). So that wouldn't be detectable with ground-based optical telescopes.

Wait, but wait. If the quasar's emitted Lyman-alpha is at 1216, and when the cloud has a redshift z_cloud, the absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But then, the quasar itself must have a higher redshift than the cloud, right? Because the cloud is between us and the quasar.

So the quasar's emission (including the Lyman-alpha) is further redshifted. Wait, no, the quasar's own emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's absorption would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud), but the quasar's light is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). So the cloud's absorption line is at a shorter wavelength than the quasar's emission line.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused
