Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each substance undergoes this reaction to form a monobromo derivative. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the one with the lowest para-isomer yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct incoming electrophiles to certain positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is electron-donating or electron-withdrawing.

Each of the six substances is a benzene ring with a different substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, actually, I should correct that. The substituents are:

1) methyl (CH3)
2) ester (COOEt)
3) Cl
4) nitro (NO2)
5) ethyl (C2H5)
6) carboxylic acid (COOH)

Right, each substituent's effect on the ring will influence where the bromine adds. The para-isomer yield is influenced by the substituent's directing effect. If the substituent is a strong meta director, the para isomer would be less likely, because the meta positions are favored. Conversely, if it's a strong activating (ortho/para) director, the para product would form more.

Wait, no. Actually, I think whether a substituent is ortho/para or meta directing determines where the incoming group goes. For example, a strong activating group like -NH2 would be a strong o,p-director, leading to more para product. But if a substituent is deactivating, like nitro, it's a meta director, so less para and more meta.

Wait, but the problem is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So some substituents will direct the bromine to para more, others less.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, in the case of substituents that are meta directors, the major product would be the meta isomer, but the para might still be formed in some amount. So the percentage of para isomer depends on how strong the directing effect is.

So, I need to figure out each substituent's directing effect and then determine which has the highest and lowest para product.

Let me list each substituent:

1) methyl (CH3): It's an activating group (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group). So it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine substitutes, the para product would be major, along with ortho. But in the case of substitution, the para and ortho may be formed, but the ratio depends on the substituent's strength.

Wait, but when you have a substituent that is strongly activating, like -NH2, the para isomer is the major product (if possible). But for a weaker activating group, maybe the para isomer is still major but not as much as a stronger activating group.

2) COOEt (ester group): The ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the ester group is a meta director. So when bromine substitutes, the meta isomer would be formed more. Therefore, the para isomer would be less.

3) Cl: Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to inductive effect, as Cl is more electronegative than C), but it's also ortho/para directing because of the resonance effect (Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons via resonance). So chlorine is a deactivating but ortho/para director. So the para isomer would be more than meta, but less than for stronger activating groups.

4) NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating group (due to both inductive and resonance effects). It is a meta director. So the para isomer would be very low, as the meta is the major product.

5) Ethyl (C2H5): Similar to methyl, it's an alkyl group, so activating and ortho/para director. So the para product would be a major product, but perhaps less than for methyl because ethyl is a weaker activating group than methyl? Or maybe not. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? Or the other way around?

Wait, no. All alkyl groups are activating, but their activating strength depends on their size. Tertiary groups are more activating than secondary, which are more activating than primary. So ethyl (which is a primary alkyl group) is less activating than methyl, which is a primary group as well. Wait, no, methyl is a primary group but is more bulky. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps all alkyl groups are similar in their activating effect. Or maybe the larger substituents (like ethyl) are less bulky than methyl, making para substitution more favorable. I'm a bit confused here, but I think in general, all alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors. So both 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl) would lead to similar behavior, but maybe methyl is a stronger activator.

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. For example, when looking at the relative activating strengths, I think all alkyl groups are activating, but their ability to donate electrons via induction is similar. So perhaps the para product is favored for both, but maybe the substituent's size might influence the position. For example, a bulky group like tert-butyl would have more para product because the ortho positions are hindered. But in this case, both methyl and ethyl are relatively small substituents, so both would direct to ortho and para.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors, the major product is para because it's less hindered. Wait, but in some cases, like when the substituent is bulky, the para position is favored more. But for small groups like methyl and ethyl, perhaps the ortho and para are about equally favored, but the exact ratio depends on the substituent's
