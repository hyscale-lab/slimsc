Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, but what does that actually mean? I remember that when atoms are in excited states, their energy levels are higher. But how does that relate to the star's temperature?

Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in different energy states is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor. The number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is determined by the ratio involving the Boltzmann constant and the temperature.

So the Boltzmann equation, if I recall correctly, is something like N2/N1 = exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)). Wait, but wait, E2 is higher than E1, so the exponent would be negative. So when E is the energy difference, E2 - E1 is positive, say delta E. So the equation would be N2/N1 = exp(-delta E/(k T)).

In this problem, star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2. Wait, so N1 (for star_1) is higher than N2 (star_2). Wait, no, wait. The way the question is phrased says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So I think that means that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2.

So according to the Boltzmann distribution, N1/N2 = exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T1)) / exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T2)) )? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is N1_excited/N1_ground = exp(-delta E/(k T1)). Similarly for star_2, it's N2_excited/N2_ground = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

But in this case, the problem states that the excited level in star_1
