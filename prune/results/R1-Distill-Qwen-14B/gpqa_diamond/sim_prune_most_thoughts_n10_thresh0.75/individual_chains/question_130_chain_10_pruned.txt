Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of objects with large clouds of neutral hydrogen. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light stretches as it travels through the expanding universe. The question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. 

Wait, the clouds absorb light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Lyman alpha is a specific emission line from hydrogen, right? So when this hydrogen is in the line of sight between us and a background quasar, it absorbs that wavelength. But because the universe is expanding, the wavelength we observe is longer than 1216 Angstroms. That's redshift.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Lower limit would mean the smallest redshift where the object can still be detected. But wait, optical telescopes can only see so far into the infrared, right? Because beyond a certain redshift, the absorbed light moves into the infrared range, which ground-based telescopes can't detect as effectively, especially for optical ones.

So, the Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216A. If the cloud has a redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z). For ground-based optical telescopes, the maximum wavelength they can observe is about 1 micrometer, which is 10,000 Angstroms. Because beyond that, it's infrared, which is harder to observe from the ground.

Wait, but wait, optical telescopes can observe up to about 1 micrometer or even a bit more. So the maximum lambda_obs for optical would be approximately 10,000 A. So, setting lambda_obs <= 10,000 A.

So, let's plug in the numbers. Lambda_rest is 1216 A, so 1216*(1 + z) = 10,000. Solving for z: 1 + z = 10000 / 1216. Let me calculate that: 10000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 *8 = 9728, which is less than 10,000. 1216*8=9728, 10000-9728=272. So 8 + 272/1216. 272 divided by 1216 is 0.223. So total is about 8.223. So z is around 7.223. Wait, but that's higher than any of the options. The options given are up to 2.4.

Wait, did I get the maximum wavelength wrong? Maybe I'm confusing what ground-based optical can detect. Let's think again. Visible light is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms), but some telescopes can go into near-infrared, say up to 1 or 2 micrometers (10,000-20,000 Angstroms). But if the observed wavelength is beyond a certain point, the atmosphere becomes opaque. For ground-based telescopes, the atmospheric cutoff is around 1.1 micrometers (11,000 Angstroms) due to water vapor and other molecules. So maybe the maximum lambda_obs is about 10,000 A.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the quasar's emission is in the optical, but the absorption is at Lyman alpha. So the quasar emits visible light, but the absorption is at a longer wavelength due to the cloud's redshift. Oh wait, no, the quasar emits light that passes through the cloud. The cloud absorbs the Lyman alpha line of the quasar's emitted light. So the quasar's light is redshifted due to the quasar's own redshift, and the absorbing cloud's redshift is higher than that (since it's in front of the quasar, or wait, no: the
