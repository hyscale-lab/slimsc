Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, spectroscopy is a big part of determining the structure of compounds, so I'll need to use the given data.

The problem states that there's a white solid in a bottle, and the chemist has some spectral information. The options provided are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the data.

Let's go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Wait, molecular ion plus two? Could that be something like a chlorine isotope? Because Cl has a common isotope at about 35 and 37. So if the molecular formula has a Cl, the M+ would be around 156, and the M+2 would be 158, which matches the data. So the molecular weight is probably 156, and the presence of Cl is indicated by the M+2 peak at 32%, which is about the natural abundance of Cl (around 34.9% for the 37Cl isotope). So the compound likely contains a chlorine atom.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, I should see if any of them have such groups. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for esters or possibly acid chlorides. Let me think: carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch and a strong C=O around 1700, but if it's an acid, the O-H would be broad. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is around 1740-1720, or a ketone around 1715. Wait, but the IR here also has a broad peak that could be from an O-H group.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: That's an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group. So that would have both a carbonyl (from aldehyde, around 1700 maybe) and an O-H (but aldehydes don't usually have broad O-H; that's more for alcohols or phenols. Wait, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be a salicylaldehyde type structure, which is a phenol with an aldehyde. So the O-H would be broad. But the carbonyl here would be an aldehyde, which is around 1720? Hmm, but the aldehyde's C=O is usually a bit higher, around 1720 cm^-1. Wait, maybe. But then, the NMR data might have a formyl proton.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: That's a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. So it has a carboxylic acid group, which would have a broad O-H stretch (the IR shows a broad peak, but wait, in the IR, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a wide range. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, and the C=O is around 1700. Wait, but the IR here has a peak at 1720, which is a bit higher. Benzoic acid's C=O is around 1680-1710
