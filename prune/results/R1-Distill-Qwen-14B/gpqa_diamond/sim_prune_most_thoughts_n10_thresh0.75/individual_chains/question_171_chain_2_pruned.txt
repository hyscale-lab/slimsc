Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in these substitution reactions. The substances are all benzene derivatives, so each has a substituent attached. I remember that substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions—ortho, meta, or para.

The problem says to arrange the substances 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the smallest para yield comes first, and the largest comes last. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I need to figure out the directing effect of each substituent. Let me list each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it should direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So the para product should be major here.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzyloxy carbonyl group, wait no—actually, it's an ester group. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or is it O-CO-O? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So it's benzoyloxy attached to ethyl? Wait, no, the structure is benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (CO), which is connected to O and an ethyl group. So the group is O-CO-OEt? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Wait, the substituent here is COOEt, meaning the group is an ester. So the group is an ester group: OOCR, where R is ethyl. So the substituent is -O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh wait, no, that's benzoyloxy ethyl? No, wait, perhaps it's an acetyloxy group attached to benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's phenoxyacetate? No, no. Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO
