Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern. For single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles. The formula I remember is that the minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer (like 1, 2, 3...). But wait, this is when the slit width is considered as a single slit. But here, the aperture is a polygon, so it's not a single slit but maybe a multiple slit? Or perhaps it's treated as a single slit because N is very large?

Wait, the question says N is infinitely large. Oh right, so when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So in that case, the aperture is effectively a circular one. But wait, wait, no, because the apothems are all the same. Oh wait, wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So all apothems being the same means each side is equidistant from the center.

But when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. Oh, but wait, what's the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture? I think it's called the Airy disk. The central maxima is surrounded by rings of minima and maxima.

Wait, but the question says it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. So for a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) and the first dark ring around it. The angular position of the minima can be calculated.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. For a single slit, the first minimum is at θ = λ / a, where 'a' is the slit width. But for a circular aperture, it's a bit different. Let me think. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by something involving the Bessel functions. The minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function derivative is a multiple of π. 

Wait, the condition for the minima in a circular aperture is that the m-th minimum occurs when J'_m(k a sinθ) = 0, where J' is the derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind. But I'm not too clear on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the first minimum occurs at a certain angle, and the first two minima would be the first and second zeros of the derivative of the Bessel function.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. For a single slit (rectangular), the minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,3... But for a circular aperture, the pattern is more complicated
