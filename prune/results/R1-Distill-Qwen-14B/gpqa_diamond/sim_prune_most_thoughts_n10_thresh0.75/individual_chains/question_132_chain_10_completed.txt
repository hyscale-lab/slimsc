Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR question, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The options given are four different pairs of compounds, all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes diethylbenzene. So, let's break this down.

First, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check what each compound's formula is. Wait, benzene is C6H6, so if it's substituted with methyl groups, each methyl is -CH3. So tetramethylbenzene would have four CH3 groups attached to the benzene ring, right?

So, the formula for tetramethylbenzene would be C6H5(C H3)4? Let me calculate that. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyls add 4*(CH3) = 4C and 12 H. So the formula becomes C10H14. Oh, that matches the molecular formula given in the problem. So all the options except C are tetramethylbenzenes. Option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is C8H10, but the other compound would need to be C8H14 to make the mixture C16H24? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mixture is 1:1, so each compound must have the same molecular formula. Because the mixture is of two compounds each with formula C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene has formula C8H10 (since two ethyl groups are C2H5 each, so two of them would be C4H10; benzene is C6H6, so total C6+4= C10, H6 +10= H16? Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate. Diethylbenzene: benzene (C6H5) + two ethyl groups (each is C2H5). So each ethyl has 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens? Or wait, ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so each is 2 carbons, 7 hydrogens (since the benzene is attached to a CH2). So two ethyl groups would be 2*2=4 carbons, and 2*(2+3)=10 hydrogens? So the formula would be C6H5(C2H5)2 → C6 + 4 = C10, and H5 (from benzene) plus 10 (from ethyl groups) → H15? Wait, but benzene is C6H6. Oh wait, when you substitute, each ethyl group takes a hydrogen. So each ethyl substitution replaces one H on benzene. So two ethyl groups would result in C6H5 (two ethyl groups attached) → C6H5(C2H5)2. Let me count the H: benzene has 6 H normally. Each substitution replaces one H, so 6 -2 =4 H in the ring. Then each ethyl group has 5 H (since CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H). So 4 + 2*(5) )= 4+10=14 H. So the formula would be C10H16? Wait, but the mixture is C10H14. So if the option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene (which is C10H16), that doesn't match. But the problem says the compounds are C10H14. Hmm, so perhaps option C is not possible because one of the compounds would have a different formula. So maybe option C is not the correct answer because one compound has the wrong formula. So perhaps the correct answer must be among options A, B, or D, which are all tetramethylbenzenes, so their formulas are correct.

So now, let me think about the NMR signals. The aromatic region shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Each aromatic singlet probably corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. So each compound has an aromatic region that contributes a singlet.

Wait, but wait. The NMR spectrum is a mixture of two compounds. So each compound contributes its own signals. But the question says the solution has a 1:1 mixture, so each component contributes equally. So in the NMR, each signal from each compound would appear, but their areas would be in proportion to their amounts. So, for the aromatic region: two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. That suggests each compound contributes one singlet each, and each singlet's integration is in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound has a singlet in the aromatic region, and their integrals are 1:1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe each compound has two sets of equivalent protons, but perhaps the way their signals overlap, but the problem says two signals (two singlets) in the aromatic region. So each compound contributes one singlet, and they are at different shifts, but each is a singlet. So each compound must have only a single type of aromatic proton, which integrates to the same area as the other.

But wait, no, because the two signals are in 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes an equal amount to the integral. So each compound has a singlet in the aromatic region. So each compound must have a certain symmetry leading to only one type of aromatic proton.

Hmm, how can a tetramethylbenzene have only one type of aromatic proton? Let me think about the structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That's like a ring with four adjacent methyl groups. Wait, that's called 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, but that's not possible because in a benzene ring, four adjacent positions would be 1,2,3,4; that's a 1,2,3,4 substitution. But wait, such a structure would have two methyl groups adjacent (like 1 and 2), then another adjacent (2 and 3), etc. But wait, a benzene ring can't have four substituents all adjacent. Oh wait, wait. No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, leaving positions 5 and 6 empty. So the structure would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4, and no substituents at 5 and 6.

Wait, but that's a very crowded structure, but regardless, let's think about the symmetry. If the ring has methyl groups at 1,2,3,4, is there any symmetry? Let me imagine the structure. Positions 1 and 3 are adjacent to 2, and positions 4 and 2 are adjacent. So perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's para-substituted in some way, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so 1,2,3,4 substitution), but that might have some symmetry that causes the aromatic protons to be equivalent.

Wait, but if four substituents are adjacent, perhaps the ring is symmetric. Wait, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the substituents are adjacent, so the ring would have a sort of "staggered" substituents. But maybe the structure is such that the remaining two positions (5 and 6) are each adjacent to substituents. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has equivalent protons.

Wait, perhaps the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is actually impossible because benzene is a planar ring, and having four substituents would make it difficult. Alternatively, maybe it's a different arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the aromatic protons to be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the compounds in the options have certain substitution patterns that lead to equivalent aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that the remaining Hs are all equivalent.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the aromatic region. Let's think about each option's compounds.

Option A: Compounds 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

So the first compound in option A is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's imagine the structure. The benzene ring has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are empty. Now, the aromatic protons would be at positions 5 and 6. Are these equivalent?

Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 5 and 6 would each be adjacent to substituents. Let me number the ring as follows: positions 1 is where a methyl is attached, then moving clockwise, 2,3,4 are also methyls, and 5 and 6 are empty. So positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to position 4 and 1, respectively. Wait, but in that case, position 5 is between 4 and 6, which is methyl at 4 and empty at 6. Position 6 is between 5 (empty) and 1 (methyl). So the two remaining Hs are at positions 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think about the symmetry. If the ring has methyl groups at 1,2,3,4, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing between positions 5 and 6. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mirror plane. In that case, positions 5 and 6 would be mirror images, but maybe they are equivalent in terms of their chemical environment.

Wait, but perhaps the two Hs are para to each other. Wait, in a benzene ring, if the substituents are adjacent (like 1,2,3,4), then the positions 5 and 6 would each have two adjacent substituents. So H5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6? Wait, no, substituents at 4 is methyl, position 5 is H, position 6 is H, but position 6 is adjacent to substituent at 1. Hmm, maybe the two Hs at 5 and 6 are not equivalent, leading to two different signals in the NMR. But the problem states that in the mixture, the aromatic region has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet. Therefore, each compound must have only one type of aromatic H, which is a singlet.

So, in the first compound of option A (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene), are all the aromatic Hs equivalent? Let me see. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the remaining Hs are at 5 and 6. Are these two Hs equivalent? Well, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes H5 and H6 equivalent, then they would be a singlet. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along the axis that passes through the center between positions 5 and 6, then H5 and H6 would be equivalent and give a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps each of these Hs is equivalent in the structure. Let me imagine the structure. Let's say the four methyl groups are at 1,2,3,4 in a row. Then, the substituents are arranged in a way that the ring is symmetric. So, rotating the ring 180 degrees would swap positions 5 and 6. So yes, a 180-degree rotation would make H5 and H6 equivalent. Thus, they would be a singlet.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the two Hs at 5 and 6 would be equivalent, so in the NMR, they would show as a single peak, a singlet. So the first compound in option A would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region.

Now, the second compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me think about its structure. So methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. So the remaining Hs are at positions 4 and 6.

Are these Hs equivalent? Let's check the symmetry. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3, and 5. So position 4 is between 3 and 5, which are both methyls. Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). Wait, no: position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). Wait, that means both position 4 and 6 have two methyl substituents adjacent. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So the H at position 4 and position 6 would each be adjacent to two methyl groups. Are these Hs equivalent? Let's see.

The molecule may have a plane of symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent. For example, if we imagine a plane that goes through the center of the ring and bisects positions 4 and 6. Then, under reflection, H4 would swap with H6, making them equivalent. So yes, their chemical environments would be the same, leading to a singlet.

Thus, each compound in option A would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region. Since the mixture is 1:1, the two singlets would appear in a 1:1 ratio. That matches the NMR description.

Now, let's look at the other parts of the NMR spectrum. There are three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, all singlets. These are likely from methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Each methyl group in tetramethylbenzenes would produce a singlet if they're all equivalent. But in reality, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups might be in different environments, leading to different signals.

Wait, each compound in the mixture contributes their own methyl signals. So if the two compounds have different types of methyl groups, their signals would add up.

Wait, but let me think about each option's compounds and their methyl groups.

First, let's consider the two compounds in option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound (1,2,3,4-TMB): substituents at 1,2,3,4. How many unique methyl groups are there?

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-TMB, the substituents are in a row. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are symmetric with respect to the ring. Similarly, methyl at 2 and 3 are in the middle. Wait, perhaps the methyls at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Let me see. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry that reflects positions 1 and 4, and 2 and 3. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the ones at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So the NMR would show two signals for the methyl groups: one for the 1 and 4 positions, and another for the 2 and 3 positions.

But wait, wait. Let me imagine the structure. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 1 and 4 are each adjacent to two substituents (2 and 5 would be substituents? Wait, no, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are H. So the methyl at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (but 6 is H), so wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1,2,3,4 would create a certain symmetry.

Wait, maybe the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent. So they would give the same signal. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 3 may be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,2,3,4-TMB has a mirror plane that makes 1 and 4 equivalent, and 2 and 3 equivalent. So in the NMR, the methyl groups would split into two signals: one for 1 and 4, and another for 2 and 3.

Similarly, the second compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-TMB. Let's see what its methyl groups look like.

In 1,2,3,5-TMB, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the remaining positions are 4 and 6, which are H. Let's see the symmetry.

The substituents at 1,2,3,5: is there any symmetry? Let me think about possible symmetry elements. Maybe a plane that goes through the ring's center and positions 4 and 6. So, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe the substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and 2 and 3 are equivalent as well.

Wait, but in 1,2,3,5-TMB, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the substituent at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H), but wait, no, substituent at 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 (H) and 6 (H? No, substituent at 5 is a methyl, so adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H? No, substituent at 5 is a methyl, so the adjacent positions 4 and 6 are H. Wait, but in that case, the substituents at 1,2,3,5: positions 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H?), 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, and 5 (methyl?), 3 is adjacent to 2, 4 (H?), and 5 (methyl?), and 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). Hmm, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the methyl groups at 1 and 5 equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 equivalent.

If that's the case, the NMR for 1,2,3,5-TMB would show two methyl signals: one for 1 and 5, and another for 2 and 3.

So, when these two compounds (1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB) are mixed 1:1, the NMR would show the methyl signals from each.

For 1,2,3,4-TMB: two methyl signals (say, one at δ 2.2 ppm and another at a different shift).

For 1,2,3,5-TMB: another two methyl signals.

Wait, but the problem states that the NMR shows three signals in the 2.2 ppm region in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps each of the compounds contributes some methyl groups that overlap or don't.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about each compound's methyl group environments.

Let me take each option's compounds and determine how many unique methyl signals they each contribute.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.

1,2,3,4-TMB:

Methyl groups at 1,2,3,4.

- The methyl at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (which is H). Wait, substituent at 6 is H, so methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.

- Similarly, methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents at 1 and 4 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. Similarly, the substituents at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So in 1,2,3,4-TMB, there are two types of methyl groups: those at 1 and 4, and those at 2 and 3. So two signals.

Similarly, in 1,2,3,5-TMB:

Methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.

- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (H).

- Methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H).

Wait, perhaps methyl at 1 is adjacent to substituent at 2 and H at 6, while methyl at 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 (H? No, substituent at 4 is H, as the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So methyl at 5 is adjacent to substituent at 4 (H) and 6 (H). So methyl at 1 is adjacent to substituent at 2 (methyl) and H at 6. Methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and 6.

Hmm, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So in 1,2,3,5-TMB, two methyl signals.

So when mixed, the two compounds would each contribute two methyl signals. But the problem says that in the NMR, there are three signals in the 2.2 ppm region, in 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think about the integration. Let's say each compound contributes two methyl signals, but some are overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound contributes two signals, and the other contributes one.

Wait, perhaps in one of the compounds, some methyl groups are equivalent, while in the other, they are not.

Wait, let's think of another option. Let's take option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.

So first compound: 1,2,4,5-TMB.

Methyl substituents at 1,2,4,5.

So positions 3 and 6 are H.

Looking for symmetry: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 1 and 5 are adjacent to 2 and 6 (H), while 4 and 2 are adjacent. Wait, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry that makes the methyl groups at 1 and 5 equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 equivalent.

So in this case, 1,2,4,5-TMB would have two methyl signals: one for 1 and 5, another for 2 and 4.

Second compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-TMB, which as discussed earlier, would have two methyl signals: one for 1 and 5, another for 2 and 3.

So when these two are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the methyl signals would be:

From 1,2,4,5-TMB: two signals (say, a and b).

From 1,2,3,5-TMB: two signals (a' and b').

But perhaps some of these are the same, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, for example, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 in 1,2,4,5-TMB are equivalent, and in 1,2,3,5-TMB, the 1 and 5 methyls are also equivalent. So their signals would be the same, leading to a single peak from both compounds.

Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 4 in 1,2,4,5-TMB are equivalent. In 1,2,3,5-TMB, the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. But are the environments of these methyl groups the same across the two compounds?

Hmm, perhaps not. So let's say, the 2 and 4 methyls in 1,2,4,5-TMB would be in a different environment than the 2 and 3 methyls in 1,2,3,5-TMB. So they would be different.

So for option D:

1,2,4,5-TMB contributes two methyl signals (let's say A and B).

1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two methyl signals (A' and B').

But if A and A' are the same, then they would merge into a single peak. But B and B' are different.

So the total number of signals would be three: A (from both compounds), B (from first compound), and B' (from second compound). So integrations would be (2A's from 1:1 ratio?), no. Wait, each of the two compounds contributes their own signals, so if A and A' are same, their integrals would add.

Wait, but the problem states that in the NMR, the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps two signals from one compound and one from another.

Wait, maybe one of the compounds contributes two signals, and the other contributes one. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three methyl signals while the other has two, but that doesn't seem likely because tetramethylbenzenes typically have two methyl signals.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two methyl signals, and the other has three, but that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.

Wait, let's think about the methyl signals for each.

1,2,4,5-TMB:

Methyl groups at 1,2,4,5.

Are the methyls at 1 and 5 equivalent? Let's see. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that swaps 1 and 5, then yes. Similarly, methyls at 2 and 4 are equivalent.

So two signals: one for 1&5, another for 2&4.

1,2,3,5-TMB:

Methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.

Do the methyls at 1&5 and 2&3 have similar environments?

In 1,2,3,5-TMB, perhaps the methyls at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two signals.

When mixed, the two compounds' methyl signals would be:

1,2,4,5-TMB: methyls at 1&5 (signal A), 2&4 (signal B).

1,2,3,5-TMB: methyls at 1&5 (signal A'), 2&3 (signal C).

So if signals A and A' are the same, they would merge into one peak. If B and C are different, they would split into two.

So the total would be three signals: A (from both compounds), B (from first compound), C (from second compound).

The integrations would depend on how many H each signal has.

For 1,2,4,5-TMB:

Each of the methyl groups at 1&5 has 2 (since two methyl groups). Similarly, 2&4 have 2.

Wait, no. Each methyl group is CH3, so each contributes 3 H. But the question is about the number of equivalent Hs in each signal. So for 1,2,4,5-TMB, signal A comes from two methyl groups (1 and 5), each with 3 H → total of 6 H. Signal B comes from two methyl groups (2 and 4), each with 3 H → 6 H.

Similarly, for 1,2,3,5-TMB, signal A' comes from two methyl groups (1 and 5), each 3 H → 6 H. Signal C comes from two methyl groups (2 and 3), each 3 H → 6 H.

But wait, when mixed 1:1, each compound contributes equally. So the total integrals would be:

From 1,2,4,5-TMB:

Signal A: 6 H → in the mixture (1:1), 6 H from each compound → total 12 H.

Signal B: 6 H → 6 H from each → total 12 H.

From 1,2,3,5-TMB:

Signal A': 6 H → 6 H each → total 12 H.

Signal C: 6 H → 6 H each → total 12 H.

But wait, but the NMR shows three signals in 2.2 ppm region in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps some signals are overlapping.

Wait, if the 1,2,4,5-TMB's signal A and the 1,2,3,5-TMB's signal A' are the same (same shift), they would add up. So A and A' would be one signal, with integral 12 (from each) +12 (from other) → 24 H.

Then, the other two signals would be B (12 H) and C (12 H). But the problem states that the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integrals would be in the ratio of 2:1:1, meaning the sum of the three would be 4 parts. So perhaps the first signal is 2 parts, and the other two are 1 each.

Wait, but in our case, if A and A' are same, then their integral would be 24 H, which is more than the others. But the problem's signals are in 2:1:1, which sums to 4 parts. So perhaps the three signals are 8, 4, 4 H each. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the numbers from the compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps the integration is based on the number of protons in each signal from each compound. Let's think again.

Wait, each compound in the mixture contributes equally. So for option D's two compounds:

1,2,4,5-TMB contributes:

- A (1 and 5 methyls): 6 H (2 methyl groups, each 3 H).

- B (2 and 4 methyls): 6 H.

1,2,3,5-TMB contributes:

- A' (1 and 5 methyls): 6 H.

- C (2 and 3 methyls): 6 H.

So when mixed 1:1, the total integrals would be:

A (from first compound) + A' (from second) → 6 +6 =12 H.

B (from first) →6 H.

C (from second) →6 H.

But the problem states that the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, meaning the integrals are 8, 4, 4, or some other 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, but 12,6,6 don't fit into 2:1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the two compounds contribute different numbers of methyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the integration of the NMR signals. If the NMR shows three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, the integrals could represent the number of H in each signal.

So the three signals have integrals in the ratio 2:1:1. So the first signal has twice as much as the others.

Let me think about how that could happen.

Suppose that in the mixture, one of the compounds contributes a signal with twice the H of the others. Like, one compound gives a signal with 6 H, and the other gives two signals, each with 3 H. But with a 1:1 mixture, the total would be 6, 3, 3, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, that's possible. So let me see which option allows that.

So, perhaps in option D, the 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes a signal with two methyl groups (6 H) and another with two (6 H), while the 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes one methyl group with 3 H and another with 3 H. But that would require each compound to have different numbers, which doesn't make sense because each is a tetramethylbenzene, so each contributes four CH3 groups.

Wait, no, each compound contributes four methyl groups, so each would have four CH3 groups, but perhaps some are equivalent.

Wait, but if one of the compounds has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups (say, two signals), and the other has three signals (unlikely for a tetramethylbenzene?), that could lead to three signals. But I think tetramethylbenzenes typically have two or perhaps more, but not three.

Wait, but perhaps one of the compounds has three different types of methyl groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, and the other has three sets, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me look at the options and see which pair of compounds would give two singlets in the aromatic region and three signals in the methyl region with the correct ratio.

So, let's think about the aromatic region first. Each compound must contribute a singlet. So each must have only one type of aromatic H.

Which of the options have compounds that each have only one type of aromatic H?

Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB. Both have two H in the ring, which are equivalent, leading to one singlet each.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-TMB. Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. So Hs at 3 and 6.

Are H3 and H6 equivalent? Let me think about symmetry. If the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then perhaps H3 and H6 are equivalent. So each would be a singlet. So the first compound in option B contributes a singlet.

Second compound in option B is 1,2,3,4-TMB. As discussed earlier, it has two Hs at 5 and 6, which are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

So both compounds in option B would contribute a singlet each in the aromatic region. So that fits.

Now, the methyl groups.

In option B, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB.

1,2,4,5-TMB: substituents at 1,2,4,5 → methyl groups at these positions. How many unique signals?

Assuming that the methyls at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So two signals.

Similarly, 1,2,3,4-TMB: substituents at 1,2,3,4 → methyls at 1,2,3,4. Could have two signals: 1 and 4 equivalent, 2 and 3 equivalent.

So when these two are mixed, each contributes two signals.

But the problem states three signals with 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps the two compounds' signals don't overlap, leading to four signals, which doesn't fit. So perhaps option B is not the correct answer.

Hmm.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-TMB → two methyl signals.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-TMB → two methyl signals.

If their signals don't overlap, that's four signals. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps one of their signals overlaps.

Wait, suppose that 1,2,4,5-TMB's methyl groups at 1&5 are equivalent, and 2&4 are equivalent.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-TMB's methyl groups at 1&5 are equivalent, and 2&3 are equivalent.

So, in the mixture, the 1&5 methyls from both compounds may have similar chemical shifts, leading to a single peak. The 2&4 from first compound and 2&3 from the second compound would be different, leading to two other peaks.

So the three signals would be:

- 1&5 from both compounds → 2:1 ratio (since each contributes equally, but if the integrals add up to 2 parts for 1&5 and 1 part each for the others, that could fit the 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the integrals.

Each compound contributes two methyl signals. If 1,2,4,5-TMB's 1&5 methyls contribute 6 H (two methyl groups, 3 H each), and 1,2,3,5-TMB's 1&5 contribute another 6 H, together they'd be 12 H. So that would be a signal with twice the H of the other two.

The other two signals would be 6 H each (from 2&4 and 2&3). But that would lead to a ratio of 12:6:6 → 2:1:1, which matches the description.

So this would fit.

Thus, option D would have this scenario.

So the three signals in the methyl region would be:

- 12 H (from 1&5 of both compounds) → 2 parts.

- 6 H (2&4 from first compound) → 1 part.

- 6 H (2&3 from second compound) → 1 part.

Which gives a 2:1:1 ratio, as required.

So the aromatic region also fits, with two singlets each contributing 1:1 ratio.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. The spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) and three singlets in the methyl region (around 2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio. The molecular formula of the compounds is C10H14, which corresponds to tetramethylbenzenes or related structures.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula and Structure**:
   - Tetramethylbenzenes (C10H14) have four methyl groups (-CH3) attached to a benzene ring. The substitution pattern determines the symmetry and the number of unique protons in the NMR spectrum.

2. **Aromatic Region (6.7 ppm)**:
   - The spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region, each integrating to a 1:1 ratio. This implies that each compound contributes one type of equivalent aromatic proton, resulting from symmetry in their substitution patterns.

3. **Methyl Region (2.2 ppm)**:
   - The spectrum shows three singlets in the methyl region in a 2:1:1 ratio. This suggests that the two compounds have different environments for their methyl groups, leading to distinct signals. The integration ratio indicates that one signal corresponds to twice the number of protons compared to the other two.
