Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let's see what the question says. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran qPCR on each with three technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, R^2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. Hmm, wait, I remember that in qPCR, the efficiency is usually close to 100% for a good assay, so that makes sense. A perfect R squared means the data fits the curve perfectly, so the model is a good fit.

Looking at the Ct values, each concentration has three replicates with a small variation. Let's see: for 100,000 copies, the Ct values are around 34. For 10,000, Ct is about 30.6. Then 27.3, 24, and 20.7. Each Ct is about 3.3 lower when the concentration is ten times less. Wait, the slope is -3.3. Oh, okay, that's matching. Because each tenfold dilution should decrease Ct by 3.3 cycles if the efficiency is 100% (which corresponds to a slope of -3.3 in the calibration curve equation, which is Ct = slope * log(copy number) + intercept).

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. Let me check the options.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. But he got a good R^2 and efficiency, so this shouldn't be the case. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target amount. But his data seems consistent. Each tenfold decrease in copy number leads to a Ct decrease of about 3.3, which aligns with the slope. So B might not be right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, what? No, the Ct difference is exactly 3.3 (as seen between 100000 to 10000, which is a ten-fold dilution, and the Ct goes from ~34 to ~30.6, a drop of 3.4, which is close to 3.3 considering rounding). So ten-fold should be exactly 3.3 cycles. So C is saying this isn't the case, but in reality, it is. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Deviation more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, each replicate has a variation of about 0.3. For example, at 100,000, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences are 0.3 each. But that's within a small range. Technical replicates are expected to have low variation, so a deviation of up to 0.3 is acceptable, maybe even a bit more. So D is suggesting the deviation is too high, but in this case, it's exactly 0.3. Wait, but the question says the options are explanations for the discrepancies. What's the issue here?

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So perhaps the issue is that the Ct values are varying more than expected, but each replicate is only varying by 0.3. Alternatively, maybe the standard deviation within the replicates is acceptable. So perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: When the efficiency is 100%, each tenfold dilution should lead to a Ct change of exactly 3.3219 (since log2(10) is approximately 3.3219). The slope here is -3.3, which is close but not exact. So would that cause a discrepancy?

Wait, no, because the slope being -3.3 is very close to -3.32
