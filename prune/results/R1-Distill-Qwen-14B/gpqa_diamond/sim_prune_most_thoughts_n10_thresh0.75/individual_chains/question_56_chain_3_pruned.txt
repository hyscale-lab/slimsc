Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the |3,0,0⟩ state decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and the dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Oh right, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1. The magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0 (since it's |3,0,0⟩). So l=0, which is an s orbital. To go to another state via dipole transition, the next state must have l=1 because l can only change by ±1. So from l=0, it must go to l=1.

But wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which is l=0 again. So the transition can't go directly from l=0 to l=0 because that's a change of 0, which isn't allowed by the dipole selection rule. So the process must involve an intermediate state where l=1.

So the decay must go through two steps: 3,0,0 → some state with l=1, then that state → 1,0,0.

Okay, looking at the options, all the options have a two-step process. Let's check each one.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. So first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Then from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0.

Wait, but for the second transition, can l change from 1 to 0? Yes, because Δl is -1, which is allowed.

But wait, what about the m values? In the first transition, m starts at 0. The next state has m=0. So Δm is 0, which is allowed. Then, the next transition goes from m=0 to m=
