Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem involves a chemist performing two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Then, the products are combined and run on both standard and chiral HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions here are important. After mCPBA, there's aqueous acid. Oh right, that's probably an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

Epoxides can undergo different types of ring-opening reactions. In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack. Wait, but what's the nucleophile in this case? In aqueous acid, water acts as the nucleophile. So, the epoxide would open to form a diol.

Wait, but how does the stereochemistry come into play here? Let me think. Both (E) and (Z) alkenes are reacting. Let's consider each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it adds across the double bond in an epoxidation. The stereochemistry of the addition depends on the starting alkene. For an E-alkene, the substituents on either side are opposite, so the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide? Or wait, no, when peracids add to alkenes, they form an epoxide where the oxygen adds across the double bond. The configuration of the starting alkene affects the geometry of the epoxide.

Wait, but I think that for epoxidation, the endo rule might apply, but maybe that's more for cyclic alkenes. Regardless, the key point is that the configuration of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, let me recall: when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the oxygen adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, a cis (Z) double bond would form a cis epoxide.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide (epoxide where the two oxygen substituents are on opposite sides).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid. In acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. The ring-opening of epoxides in acid typically leads to the formation of a diol, with the stereochemistry determined by the acid-catalyzed mechanism.

Wait, in the ring-opening,
