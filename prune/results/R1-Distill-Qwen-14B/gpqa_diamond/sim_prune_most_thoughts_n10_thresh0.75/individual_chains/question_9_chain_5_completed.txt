Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is about how they look after certain operations, like rotations or reflections. C3h symmetry—let me think. Oh right, C3h is a point group, and it includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. And the options are labeled A to D.

I need to figure out each molecule's structure and their symmetry. Let me go through each option.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think triisopropyl borate has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is symmetric. Since all three substituents are the same, it should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. Wait, but does it have a mirror plane? Let me visualize. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron. The three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically. If I imagine the boron at the center, each isopropyl group is in a plane. There's probably a horizontal mirror plane through the boron. So maybe this molecule has C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I believe. It has a bridge structure. The structure is like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, if I remember correctly. It's a tricyclic structure with three rings. Quinuclidine is known for having high symmetry. I think it has a three-fold axis because of the way the bridgeheads are arranged. Let me think about its symmetry. Quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I'm not certain. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is quite rigid. It's a bridged bicyclic amine. I'm not sure about the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Maybe it doesn't have one, so its point group might be D3h instead? Or maybe it's C3v or something else. I'm a bit confused here.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. Trifuran means three furan rings connected. The benzo group is attached at specific positions. So the molecule has three fused furan rings and a benzene ring attached in a certain way. Looking at the substituents, the numbering suggests that the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way. Wait, but I'm not sure. If the substituents are in positions that allow for a three-fold rotation, then maybe. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule has a lower symmetry because the substituents might not be symmetric enough.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That sounds more complex. Triphenyleno indicates three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. The way the substituents are attached—maybe this molecule has a higher degree of symmetry. If each of the three substituents is the same (like phenyl groups) and arranged symmetrically around the central structure, maybe it has three-fold symmetry. Also, maybe it has a mirror plane. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged. If each phenyl is attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart, and perhaps mirrored, then this could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, going back to the question. The correct answer is the molecule with C3h symmetry. So which of these has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane?

Triisopropyl borate (option C): the three isopropyl groups are identical and arranged symmetrically around boron. So when you rotate 120 degrees, the structure looks the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The boron is in the center, so a plane that's perpendicular to the trigonal plane (like through the boron) would be a vertical plane. Wait, no. Wait, C3h has a horizontal mirror plane, which would be a plane that's parallel to the base. So for example, in a trigonal planar molecule, the horizontal mirror would be the plane that contains the central atom and the substituents. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is horizontal as in parallel to the base.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. In triisopropyl borate, the boron is at the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So the molecule is symmetric. The three substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. The mirror plane would be a vertical plane passing through the boron and perhaps one of the substituents. But C3h symmetry includes a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the C3h point group is a type of axial symmetry. Let me think. The C3h group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal mirror plane.

If I imagine triisopropyl borate, it's a flat molecule with three identical groups around boron. So the horizontal mirror plane would be the plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, no. Wait, for C3h, the rotation axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane. So if the mirror plane is horizontal, then the rotation axis is vertical. So, for example, in a trigonal pyramidal molecule, the C3 axis is vertical, and the mirror planes are horizontal. But in a trigonal planar molecule, like triisopropyl borate, the rotation axis is in the plane. So perhaps that's not C3h.

Wait, maybe it's another point group. For trigonal planar molecules, the point group is D3h, if there's a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe C3v if there are vertical mirror planes.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry. Because the three substituents are symmetric, and there are three vertical mirror planes passing through each C-Br (or C-B) bond. So, in that case, the point group would be C3v.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry. So that would eliminate option C.

Now, thinking about quinuclidine (option D). Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a bridge structure with three bridgeheads. So, the molecule is symmetric. Each bridge is the same length. Quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis. If I imagine rotating the molecule 120 degrees, it would look the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would pass through the center of the molecule, perhaps. If the molecule is symmetric across such a plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a flat molecule? No, it's a bridged bicyclic structure. The molecule is not flat. So a horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that cuts through the molecule in a way that the top and bottom are mirrored. Let me visualize the structure. Quinuclidine is a rigid molecule with three bridges. The molecule is symmetric when rotated, but does it have a horizontal mirror?

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a center of inversion symmetry. Wait, that would make the point group I. But I don't think it's that. Alternatively, maybe it has a three-fold axis and no mirror planes, making it C3. Or perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, which would be C3h.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the symmetry elements. If quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h. But I'm not sure. I think maybe quinuclidine's point group is C3v or D3h. Alternatively, I might have to think about the substituents. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine. The structure is symmetric, but perhaps the nitrogen's position breaks some symmetry.

Wait, no. Quinuclidine is a bridgehead amine. So the structure is symmetric. It has three equivalent bridge positions. So when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. Additionally, maybe there's a horizontal mirror plane through the nitrogen? Or not. Hmm, I'm not certain. I might need to think about this differently.

Now, looking at options A and B. Let's see the structures.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is three fused furan rings connected with a benzene ring. The numbering suggests that the benzene is attached in a way that may disrupt symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, like each at 120 degrees, then it could have C3h.

Alternatively, the way the benzo group is attached might break the symmetry. For example, if one substituent is a benzene and the others are something else, symmetry is lost. But in this case, the molecule is benzo[...]trifuran, implying a benzene ring fused to the trifuran system. Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzofused trifuran, which could have a three-fold symmetry if the substituents are arranged properly.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's easier to think of the other option.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. The way they're attached could be symmetric. If each phenyl is attached at 120-degree positions, perhaps the molecule has three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but the substituents are phenyl groups. If they're attached at positions that are symmetric, like each on a different face of the molecule, then perhaps it has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of triphenylene. Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way. It has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so its point group is C3h.

Wait, so if the molecule in option A is a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran, then perhaps the symmetry is preserved. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the central part of the molecule (the trifuran) disrupts the symmetry.

Wait, but the core structure of triphenylene has three-fold symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around this core, then the entire molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So, putting it all together, which molecule has C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate probably has C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Quinuclidine's symmetry might be C3 or D3h, but I'm not certain.

Benzo[...]trifuran (option B) might not have three-fold symmetry because of the benzene substituent.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) might have a triphenylene part which has C3h symmetry, but is the entire molecule symmetric?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because triphenylene (the substituent) has three-fold symmetry, and if the trifuran core is symmetric, then the whole molecule would have C3h.

Wait, but the trifuran part could have oxygen atoms in certain positions that might disrupt the symmetry. Let me think. The name is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The substituents are phenyl groups attached in certain positions. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror, then yes.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The correct answer is the molecule that has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: maybe C3v.

Quinuclidine: maybe C3 or D3h.

Option A: triphenyleno... perhaps has three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, so C3h.

Alternatively, another approach: I can think about the point groups of known compounds.

Triisopropyl borane (similar to triisopropyl borate) has a trigonal planar structure, which is D3h symmetry. So the point group would be D3h, which includes C3h as a subgroup. Wait, no, D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane along with the three-fold rotation. Or is it C3h that has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, point groups: the D3h group is a higher symmetry group that contains a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, along with other elements like vertical mirror planes. So triisopropyl borate might belong to D3h, which implies it has C3h as a subgroup, but perhaps the question is specifically about C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't need the additional mirror planes, just the C3 and the horizontal mirror.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact point groups.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules are known to have C3h symmetry?

Triphenylene has C3h symmetry. So if option A is a triphenylene derivative, perhaps it inherits that symmetry.

But option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So if the trifuran is attached in a way that the triphenylene part's symmetry is retained, then option A would have C3h.

Alternatively, if the trifuran part has oxygen atoms in positions that disrupt the symmetry, but perhaps the overall structure still maintains it.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the four has C3h symmetry. Let's think again.

- Option C: triisopropyl borate. If it's D3h, then it's higher than C3h. So it would have C3h, but maybe the question is looking for a molecule that has exactly C3h and not higher symmetry.

But the question just says which has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Because the triphenylene part has three-fold and horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, in the case of option D, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's point group is C3v. Because it has a three-fold rotation and three vertical mirror planes. So it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, so it's C3v, not C3h.

So quinuclidine is probably out.

So now, between option A and option B.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The benzo group is fused at certain positions. So if the benzene is attached in a position that disrupts the three-fold symmetry, then option B wouldn't have C3h.

Alternatively, if the structure is symmetric, perhaps it has C3h.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's structure has a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror. So it would be C3 but not C3h.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.


To determine which molecule has **C3h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C3h symmetry** includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h). The molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation and be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. The triphenylene portion is known to have **C3h symmetry**, as it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The trifuran core, if attached symmetrically, preserves this symmetry. Thus, the entire molecule likely retains **C3h symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a trifuran core with a benzene ring fused at specific positions. The fused benzene disrupts the symmetry, as the substituents are not identical or symmetrically arranged. This molecule lacks both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not exhibit **C3h symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around boron. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), it does not have a horizontal mirror plane, making its point group **C3v** rather than **C3h**. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C3h symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a rigid, symmetric structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Its point group is **C3v**, not **C3h**, meaning it does not exhibit **C3h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
The only molecule that retains **C3h symmetry** is **Option A**, as the triphenylene portion has the necessary symmetry elements, and the trifuran core does not disrupt them.

**Answer: A**
