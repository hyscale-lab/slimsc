Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me think through it step by step.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in a series of three technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly, so no issues there. The slope is -3.3, which I remember relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually -3.32 when efficiency is 100%, because the calculation is based on log2. So a slope of -3.3 is close to that, which makes sense.

Now, looking at the results, each concentration has three Ct values. For example, at 100000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. These are very consistent, each about 0.3 apart. The same pattern follows for the other concentrations. So the technical replicates are pretty close together, which is good.

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. Wait, but his data looks pretty clean. The Ct values increase as the starting copies decrease, which is expected. Because higher starting amounts should reach the threshold sooner, meaning lower Ct. Wait, wait. No, wait, higher concentrations should have lower Ct, right? Because more copies mean it takes fewer cycles to reach the detection threshold. So 100000 copies have Ct around 34, and 10 copies have Ct around 20.7. That's right—higher concentration, lower Ct. So the trend is correct.

The options are about why there are discrepancies. Let's look at the options:

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true because he's using it for quantification, and the data seems to fit well. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with the target amount. But in his case, the Ct does change with concentration, so Ct and amount are in agreement. So B isn't correct.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm. Wait, each ten-fold dilution (like from 100000 to 10000) would require a change in Ct of about 3.32 cycles because each ten-fold is log10(10), so log2(10)=~3.32. His slope is -3.3, which is close. So each dilution step (10x) leads to a Ct increase of about 3.3. Looking at the data, from 100000 (Ct ~34) to 10000 (Ct ~30.6), the difference is about 3.4. Which is close to 3.3, so that makes sense. So the ten-fold dilution is about 3.3 cycles. So why is C the option? Oh, wait option C says "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles." But in this case, it's about 3.3 cycles. So maybe that's not the issue. Or perhaps the data doesn't show that. Wait, the actual change is about 3.4, which is just a bit more than 3.3. So it's not way off. So maybe C is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, each triplet varies by about 0.3. For example, 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The maximum deviation is 0.6 (34.5-33.9=0.6). Wait, but the question says "the deviation is more than 0.3". The standard deviation or the max difference? If the maximum difference between the replicates is 0.6, then yes, it's more than 0.3. So option D says this. But wait, in qPCR, the technical replicates are usually expected to be very close—like within 0.3 cycles because each replicate is the same sample. Here, the replicates are varying up to 0.6, which is double that. So that could be a problem. So option D is pointing out that the deviation is more than 0.3.

But wait, the question is asking which option explains the discrepancies in his results. So what's considered a discrepancy? If the technical replicates are varying a lot, that's a problem. The Ct values for each concentration are very consistent,
