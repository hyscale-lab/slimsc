Okay, so I have this NMR question about aromatic compounds, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, I need to figure out what these signals mean. The aromatic region around 6.7 ppm usually indicates protons that are deshielded, so probably in an aromatic ring. Singlets mean no neighboring H's, so those protons are probably attached to carbons that don't have any adjacent H's. Since there are two singlets and the compounds are a 1:1 mixture, maybe each compound contributes one singlet.

Wait, but each compound would have their own set of protons. Hmm. Or perhaps each singlet is from each compound's aromatic region. Since the ratio is 1:1, each singlet integrates to the same amount, so each corresponds to one of the compounds.

Now, looking at the aliphatic region: three singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Those are probably methyl groups because methyl protons are typically around 1-2 ppm. But wait, 2.2 is a bit higher than usual. Maybe they're attached to something deshielding, like an oxygen or adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, but maybe it's just in a specific environment.

The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethyl. Let me look at each option.

The options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

So each of these options is a pair of structures, and I have to figure out which pair gives the NMR described.

I think tetramethylbenzenes would have multiple methyl groups attached to the ring. Let's consider each structure.

First, the aromatic signals. If a compound has four methyl groups, the substituents on the benzene ring would determine where the hydrogens are. Let's think about 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, that would be 1,2,3,4 positions all substituted with methyl. Wait, but benzene only has six positions. So 1,2,3,4 are four adjacent positions. That would make the ring heavily substituted, leaving positions 5 and 6 with H's? Or maybe all the H's are in equivalent positions?

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: So, positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. Then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents. Wait, but in such a substitution, the aromatic protons would be in positions 5 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. If the ring has four methyl groups in positions 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups. Are those H's equivalent?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the remaining H's are all equivalent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps symmetry plays a role here. For example, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene - that would make a symmetrical structure where the remaining H's are at positions 5 and 6. But wait, that's actually 1,2,3,4-tetra, which would have a symmetrical arrangement with meta and para positions. Wait, no, the positions 5 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents. Wait, perhaps in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are on four consecutive positions, which leaves the remaining two positions (5 and 6) as adjacent to substituents, but are they equivalent?

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the number of unique aromatic protons each compound has.

For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (which is also known as 1,2,3,4-tetra-xylene), the structure is such that positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are positions 5 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine the ring. Since positions 1
