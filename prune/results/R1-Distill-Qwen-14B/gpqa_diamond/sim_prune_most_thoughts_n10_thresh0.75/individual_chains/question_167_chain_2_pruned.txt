Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh, right, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, I think. Coherent states are Gaussian states, so this state is a superposition of two coherent states. That makes it a non-Gaussian state, which is why we're calculating its non-Gaussianity.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). And the parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I need to plug these into the formula.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh, right, I think tau should be the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense. But I'm not 100% sure, maybe I can assume it's the state that rho would reduce to if it were Gaussian? Or perhaps the reference Gaussian is the state with the same first and second moments as rho. I'm not entirely certain about the details here, but maybe I can proceed and see where that takes me.

First, let's compute N. Let's plug phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5 into the expression for N.

Compute sin(2*phi) first. Phi is -pi/4, so 2*phi = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2*phi) is -1.

Next, exp(-2*alpha^2). Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 gives 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. 0.3935 under the square root is approximately 0.6275. So N is about 0.6275.

Wait, but maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now. Let me think about the state |psi>.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Since |psi> is a pure state, rho is a projector. So rho = |psi><psi|, which is a rank-1 matrix. Wait, but when calculating del_b, I also need the density matrix tau of the reference Gaussian state. Hmm.

Wait, I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Because del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy. Because the relative entropy is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) = [S(rho) - S(tau)].

Wait, but von Neumann entropy is S = - trace(rho ln rho), right? So maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me check:

The von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho). So the given expression for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Which would be equal to [ - S(rho) + S(tau) ]? Because S(rho) is - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) is - S(rho).

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me write it down:

del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

But S
