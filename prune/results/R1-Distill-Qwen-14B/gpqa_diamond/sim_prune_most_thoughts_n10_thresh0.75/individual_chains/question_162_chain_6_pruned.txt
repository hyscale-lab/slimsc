Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, the metric is a bit confusing to me, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me write down the metric again to make sure I have it right. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy terms. But it's called a pseudosphere, which I think is a surface in a higher-dimensional space, maybe like a 3D pseudosphere, but the metric is for a 2D surface?

Wait, no, maybe the metric is in two dimensions, so the pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in some higher dimension. But I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a two-dimensional space, and the question is about the area of the pseudosphere, which in this context might be referring to an area in that space.

Wait, the question says, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I need to compute the area.

In general, the area of a surface in 2D can be found using the metric. The area element dA is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. But wait, the metric here is conformally flat, meaning it's of the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So the determinant of the metric is f(x,y)^2, and the area element
