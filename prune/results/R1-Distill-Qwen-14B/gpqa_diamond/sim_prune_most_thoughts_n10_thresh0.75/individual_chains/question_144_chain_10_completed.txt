Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D with different values in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think I need is distance = velocity * lifetime. But how do I find each of those?

First, I should probably find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and τ is the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. Oh right, because in particle physics, energies are often given in MeV or GeV, and when dealing with units, I need to convert them properly. So I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Let me jot down the constants I'll need. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, yeah, because 1 GeV is a huge energy, so ħ in these units is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 seconds.

Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is roughly 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 = let's calculate that. 0.32 times 20 is 6.4, which leaves 0.182, so 20 + (0.182/0.32) ≈ 20.56875. So yes, 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056e-24 seconds.

Next, the velocity. How do I find the velocity of the meson? Well, I think I can use the relativistic energy formula. The meson has a production energy E_X of 8 GeV, but its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. Since E = γ m c², then γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but units are in GeV, so perhaps I can ignore the c² because the units are consistent in natural units (like in particle physics, where c=1). So γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v is given by β c, where β = v/c. And β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, wait. The relation is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β, we get β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So let's compute that. γ is 6.6667, so 1/γ² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, meaning v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/(γ²) as (1.2/8)^2. 1.2/8 is 0.15, squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887c. Since c is about 3e8 m/s, the velocity is roughly 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the mean decay distance is v * τ. Let's compute that.

v * τ ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

2 * 2.056875 is about 4.11375, and 0.966 * 2.056875 is approximately 2.000 (because 0.966 is about 0.966 * 2 ≈ 1.932, plus 0.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.055). So total is approximately 4.11375 + 1.987 ≈ 6.10075.

Wait, maybe a better way: 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

Then 2.966 * 0.056875. Let's see, 0.05 is 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483. 0.006875 is 0.006875 * 2.966 ≈ 0.02037625. Adding them gives 0.1483 + 0.020376 ≈ 0.168676.

So total 5.932 + 0.168676 ≈ 6.100676. So approximately 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait: I think I messed up a step. Because v is 0.9887c, where c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So multiplying v and τ: (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1007 * 1e-16 m.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m and D is 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, so my calculation is giving about 6.1e-16, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity or the lifetime.

Let me recheck the lifetime calculation. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

That seems correct.

Now, perhaps the velocity calculation is wrong. Let's re-examine that.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma * m c². Since in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma squared is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, so beta is 0.9887. So velocity is 0.9887c, so about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Hmm, that seems correct. So distance is v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating the product: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

Wait, wait, no. 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 2.966 * 2.056875 is about 6.1, so 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider that the meson is produced with energy E_X, and its mass is m_X. The kinetic energy is E - m c^2. Wait, but in natural units, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/m, which is correct as 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Wait, perhaps I should use beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)), since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v. So beta = v/c = (p c)/E.

Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ). Since in natural units, c=1, beta = sqrt(1 - m^2 / E^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Same result as before.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So why am I getting a distance of about 6e-16 m, but the options are lower? Maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the lifetime is not tau, but gamma * tau? No, wait. The lifetime of the particle in its rest frame is tau. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau. Oh wait, no! Wait, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, wait, that might be where I went wrong. Because I used tau = hbar / Gamma, which is the proper lifetime, because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the same in all frames. So the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The width Γ is the same in all frames, right? Because it's a Lorentz invariant quantity. So the proper lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. But the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Wait, no, wait. No, I think that's incorrect. Because the decay width is a relativistic invariant. So if the particle is moving, the total decay width doesn't change. So the proper lifetime tau (in rest frame) is hbar / Gamma. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime is longer.

So I think I made a mistake in my initial calculation. I used tau = hbar / Gamma as the lifetime in the lab frame, but it's actually the proper lifetime. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

So I need to correct my calculation. Let's do that.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Tau is hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 6.6667.

So tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 13.644e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6667 * 2.056875 = let's compute that:

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6667 ≈ approximately 1.37125.

Adding them together: 12.34125 + 1.37125 ≈ 13.7125.

So tau_lab ≈ 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, no, wait: 6.6667 is 20/3. So 20/3 times 2.056875e-24 is (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

Divided by 3: 13.7125e-24 s.

So tau_lab ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Now, the velocity v is 0.9887c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So decay distance is v * tau_lab = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiplying the numbers: 2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ let's compute this.

1.37125 * 2 = 2.7425.

1.37125 * 0.966 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 2.966 * 1.37125.

Let me compute 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375. But since it's 2.966, which is 3 - 0.034, we can compute:

1.37125 * (3 - 0.034) = 4.11375 - (1.37125 * 0.034) ≈ 4.11375 - 0.0466225 ≈ 4.0671275.

So approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to my calculation of 4.067e-15 m. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly. So I corrected the lifetime by multiplying by gamma because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. That's the key step I had missed before. So the decay distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau_rest.

So yes, that seems to be where the mistake was. Initially, I took tau as the proper lifetime, which it is, but in the lab frame, it's longer.

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Decay Distance} = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the meson and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime of the meson in the lab frame. The given parameters are:

- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime by time dilation:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta c
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Then, calculate \( v \):

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance
The mean decay distance is:

\[
\text{Decay Distance} = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\text{Decay Distance} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The calculated decay distance \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
