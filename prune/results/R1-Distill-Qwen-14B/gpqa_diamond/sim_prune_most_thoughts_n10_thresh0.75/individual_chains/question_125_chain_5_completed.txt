Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, I think those can be treated similarly.

Wait, right, in three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator can be considered as three independent one-dimensional oscillators in each direction (x, y, z). So the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction. Each direction's energy is (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number for that direction, which is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). 

But wait, in three dimensions, the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Oh right, because each contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, sometimes the quantum numbers are combined into a single index. I remember that in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of a principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is (N + 3/2) ħω. 

So the third excited state—wait, wait, wait. What's the ground state? The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be when all n's are 0. So N=0. The first excited state would be when N=1, the second when N=2, and the third would be N=3. Because excited states go in order of increasing N. 

So the third excited state is N=3. Hence, the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Hmm, that's one part of the question.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That's the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator is given by the number of ways you can get N = n_x + n_y + n_z = some number. For N=3, the number of states is (3 + 2) choose (2) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's the combination with repetition.

The formula for the degeneracy when N is fixed is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N+2 choose 2). So for N=3, that would be (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. That lines up with option A which says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. Option C says the same energy but 3 functions, which doesn't make sense because it's a higher state. So the answer must be A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are quantized and can be expressed as \( E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the principal quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively.

The third excited state corresponds to \( N = 3 \) (since the ground state is \( N = 0 \), the first excited state is \( N = 1 \), the second is \( N = 2 \), and the third is \( N = 3 \)). Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level is determined by the number of ways to distribute \( N = 3 \) quanta among the three directions \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the combinatorial formula for degeneracy in a 3D harmonic oscillator:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \)**

Answer: A
