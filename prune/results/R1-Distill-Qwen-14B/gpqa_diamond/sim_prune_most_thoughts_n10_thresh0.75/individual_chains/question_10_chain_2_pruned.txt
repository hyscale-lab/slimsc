Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Right, the formula is density = mass/volume. So I guess I need to compare the densities of each option to find out which one is the highest.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm続, I think. So if it's the same mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's. So that's 5.5 g/cm続. 

Option b) says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, no, wait! The question says that option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, option b is described as "a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続." Wait, but that's the given density. So that's straightforward. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, if it's 2 Earth masses but same density, that would mean the volume is higher. Because density is mass over volume. So if mass is double but density same, volume must be double. Which would make sense if the radius is larger. But since the question is asking about density, option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth.
