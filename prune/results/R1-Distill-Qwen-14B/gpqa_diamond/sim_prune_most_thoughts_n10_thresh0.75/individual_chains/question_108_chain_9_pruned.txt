Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. Oh right, Oz is the z-axis. And we're looking at small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number.

Wait, the problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. I remember that the paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. So the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, but wait—wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, right? Because orbital angular momentum L is quantized, and m is the z-component. And the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), which is a constant.

So the energy due to the magnetic field, the Zeeman term, is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the dot product simplifies to H = -μ B. Substituting μ, that gives H = -( (eħ/(2m_e)) * m ) * B. So the expectation value of H would be something like <H> = -(μ_B B) m. But wait, the orbital m here is small. The question says m is small, so maybe m is around zero or a small integer like ±1 or ±2.

But wait, the problem is talking about the paramagnetic coupling term. Oh wait, paramagnetic effects are usually due to the spin magnetic moment, but wait, no—wait, paramagnetism can be due to orbital or spin contributions. Wait, no, wait: Paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, and their magnetic moments are due to the spin. Oh wait, but in the case of orbital contributions, it's called diamagnetic or paramagnetic. Hmm, but I think the question refers to the orbital magnetic moment here because the orbital m can be 0, ±1, etc. Wait, but wait, for hydrogen, the electron is in an s orbital, so the orbital angular momentum is zero for s states. So, maybe the paramagnetic term here refers to the spin part. Hmm, maybe I need to
