Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the crystal structure and some formula involving the Miller indices.

Wait, the question gives me the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I might be getting confused between interatomic distance and the lattice parameter. In a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, but in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter 'a' might not be the same as the interatomic distance. Or is it? Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the same as the lattice parameter. But rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal close-packed structure, right? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic structure with distorted cubes, maybe more like a trigonal system. Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstroms. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c can be different, but here it's specified that alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I think in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, but the angles are not 90 degrees. So yeah, a = b = c, and each angle is 30 degrees. So the lattice is rhomboh
