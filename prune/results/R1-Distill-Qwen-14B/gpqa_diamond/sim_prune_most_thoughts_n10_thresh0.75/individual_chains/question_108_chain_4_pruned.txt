Okay, so I have this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

First, the question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. Since m is small, maybe l is small too, like for the hydrogen atom's ground state or something similar.

The problem is asking about the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value compared to the transition energy delta E, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that wavelength corresponds to a specific spectral line. I think that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm. Oh right, that's in the visible range too. Let me think, the Balmer series starts at about 400 nm (H-alpha is 656 nm, H-beta is 486 nm, etc.), so maybe the question refers to the H-beta transition. 

So, the transition energy delta E is related to the wavelength by the equation E = hc/(lambda). Let me compute that. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. I'll calculate delta E first.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength lambda is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, or 486.1 x 10^-9 meters. 

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 486.1e-9 is 486.1e-9 = 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.089e-19 J. 

But wait, I should check the units. Oh, right, because 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.089e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a rough estimate. Wait, but I think the actual energy for H-alpha is around 1.89 eV, but maybe this is for a different transition. But regardless, let's keep this approximate value for now.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. 

The energy due to this interaction is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -g μ_B B m. But wait, m can be from -l to +l. For small m, maybe m is around 1 or 2? Let's assume m is small, say m=1. 

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So plugging the numbers in: g is about 1 for orbital angular momentum (since for electrons, the spin g-factor is different, but for paramagnetism due to orbital motion, g is approximately 1). 

So ⟨H⟩ = -g μ_B B m. Let's plug in the values: g=1, μ_B=9.274e-24 J/T, B=1 T, m=1 (magnitude). So ⟨H⟩ ≈ 1 * 9.274e-24 * 1 *1 = 9.274e-24 J. 

Wait, that's 9.274e-24 J. Earlier, the delta E was about 4.089e-19 J, which is much bigger. Let me compare the two. 

So delta E is about 4e-19 J, and ⟨H⟩ is about 9e-24 J. Let's see the ratio: 9e-24 /4e-19 = 2.25e-5. That's like 0.00225% of delta E. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than delta E.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the paramagnetic term might be the Zeeman effect. Oh, right, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. But in this case, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is the energy shift due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy delta E, which is the energy difference between two atomic states.

Wait a moment, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. The transition energy delta E is the energy difference between two states when an electron transitions, resulting in the emission of a photon of wavelength 0.4861 micrometers. 

The paramagnetic term would be the energy shift caused by the magnetic field. So in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split into the Zeeman levels, and the paramagnetic coupling term is the shift. So we're to compare this shift ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy delta E.

So for Hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The transition from n=2 to n=1 would give the H-alpha line, which is about 1.89 eV. Wait, but earlier my calculation gave 2.55 eV for 486 nm, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the energy using wavelength.

The wavelength λ = 486.1e-9 meters.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.089e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but I thought H-alpha was around 1.89 eV. Maybe I confused the series. Wait, H-alpha is a transition in the Balmer series from n=3 to n=2, right? So what's the actual energy of that?

Wait, E_n is -13.6 eV / n². So from n=3 to n=2: E3 = -13.6 /9 = -1.511 eV, E2 = -13.6 /4= -3.4 eV. Delta E is E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. The absolute value is 1.889 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 1.889 eV, which corresponds to wavelength λ = hc/E.

Wait, hc is 1240 eV·nm. So λ = 1240 /1.889 ≈ 657 nm, which is H-alpha. So the question must have a different transition, perhaps from n=2 to n=1, which would be the Lyman series. 

Wait, n=2 to n=1: E2=-3.4 eV, E1=-13.6 eV. Delta E is (-13.6) - (-3.4) = -10.2 eV. So photon energy is 10.2 eV. But 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is 4860 Å. Let me see where that falls. Wait, 486 nm is approximately 2.55 eV, which doesn't match any of the main hydrogen lines I know. Maybe I should just proceed.

But back to the problem. So delta E is about 2.55 eV, which is 4.089e
