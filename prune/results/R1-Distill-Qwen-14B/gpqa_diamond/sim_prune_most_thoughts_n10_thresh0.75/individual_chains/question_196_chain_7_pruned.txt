Okay, I'm trying to solve this relativistic harmonic oscillator problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. Let me think about what I remember from both classical mechanics and special relativity.

In the classical case, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the max speed v_classical would be sqrt(kA²/m) because (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² leads to v = sqrt(kA²/m).

But wait, this is a relativistic problem. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1)mc².

So for the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. Then, as it moves to the equilibrium position, all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So, the total energy (E) would be the sum of rest energy and potential energy. Wait, no, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, maybe I have to think about how energy is stored between kinetic and potential.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using relativistic equations. The potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So at any point, the total energy is (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx². But I'm not entirely sure about the form of the potential in relativistic systems. Wait, in special relativity, the force is still given by F = -kx, so the equation of motion is relativistic, but the potential energy would still be (1/2)kx², right?

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the speed is zero, so all the energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's not right because in the relativistic case, the total energy also includes the rest mass energy. Wait,
