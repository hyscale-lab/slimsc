Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit weird. So it's a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. I'm trying to remember what kind of geometry this represents. Oh right, metrics like these sometimes describe spaces with constant curvature. 

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That looks like a sphere's equation if it were in x² + y² + z², but here it's in two dimensions. So 4 is r² where r would be 2, since 2 squared is 4. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², where r is the radial coordinate in 2D. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

I remember that the metric for a sphere in 2D (like a surface of a sphere) is usually written in terms of r and θ, but this is in terms of x and y. Oh wait, maybe it's a different coordinate system, perhaps something like isothermal coordinates or conformally flat coordinates. Because the metric here is conformally flat, meaning it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor here is (32)/(4 - x² - y²).

The area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor's square root times dx dy. So the area A is the integral over the surface of sqrt(g) dx dy. But since the metric is conformally flat, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) evaluated at the point. So the area element dA = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the determinant of a 2x2 metric tensor for a conformally flat metric is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²). Since it's diagonal and g_xy is zero, it's just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) squared? No, wait no. Wait, the determinant of the metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²))², because the metric is diag(a, a), so determinant is a². Then the square root would be a, so the area element is a dx dy. So yeah, the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to something with negative curvature, like a hyperbolic surface. But this metric has (4 - x² - y²) in the denominator. If x² + y² <4, then the denominator is positive, so the metric is positive definite. But if x² + y² >4, the denominator is negative, which would make the metric have a signature of (-, -), so it's a Lorentzian metric, but we're talking about the area of the pseudosphere, which is a surface in some spacetime.

Wait, but pseudosphere radius? Maybe I'm getting confused between sphere and pseudosphere. Oh, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in this case, what is the curvature of this metric?

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function, can be computed using the formula:

K = - (1/(2E)) * ∇² ln E,

where ∇² is the flat Laplacian. Alternatively, I remember that the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2E)) * ( (E_x)_y - (E_y)_x )

But E here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let's compute
