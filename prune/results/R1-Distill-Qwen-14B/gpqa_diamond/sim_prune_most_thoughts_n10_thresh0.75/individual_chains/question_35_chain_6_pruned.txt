Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is given as a 2x2 matrix, and it's expressed as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, based on that, I have to see which of the statements A to D is correct.

First, let me recall some basics. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, maybe I can compute its eigenvalues directly without going through the whole process. Let me figure out what A_y looks like.

Given that c = h/(4π), and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then A_y = c * S. So multiplying each element by c:

Ay = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Substituting c:
Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

But wait, maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues of S first since c is a scalar. The eigenvalues of A_y would just be c times the eigenvalues of S.

What's the matrix S? It's a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ±i off-diagonal. I think this is a representation of the Pauli Y matrix, but maybe scaled somehow.

Wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. Oh, right, so S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues are ±1. So, the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of A_y, which is c times S, should be c * (+1) and c * (-1). Substituting c = h/(4π), those eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So a is either h/(4π) or -h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's check which options talk about the eigenvalues.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our eigenvalues are purely real. So this can't be. Because the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, but as per our calculation, the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So B is talking about complex eigenvalues, which isn't the case here. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not Az. Let me think. The operator A is the angular momentum, so A² would be (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). But since the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of A² would be (ħ²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues (ħ²)(3/4). 

But the thing is, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of A_y are the same as those of A² and A_z, but wait, no. Wait, for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of A² and Az are the same, but the eigenfunctions of A_y are different. Or is that not the case?

Wait, no. The angular momentum components don't share eigenfunctions unless in specific cases. For example, for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenfunctions of A_y are superpositions of the eigenfunctions of A_z. So, can an eigenfunction of A_y also be an eigenfunction of A²? Because A² commutes with all components, so if a state is an eigenstate of A², it's an eigenstate of any component of A. But since A² and A_y don't commute with each other, a state can't be an eigenstate of both unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which I don't think exists here.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For angular momentum, the operator A² commutes with each component. So A² and A_y do commute. So, eigenfunctions of A_y could also be eigenfunctions of A² because they share the same set of eigenfunctions. Wait, no, that’s not exactly right. Because if A² and A_y commute, they can be diagonalized simultaneously, meaning there exists a basis where both are diagonal. So, any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A², and vice versa.

But wait, the eigenvectors of A_y are the same as the ones for A²? Because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix in the spin-1/2 case. Because for spin-1/2, A² has eigenvalue (ħ²)(3/4) for both possible states. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, then since A² is the same for all states, the eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². So, the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². But what about A_z?

Well, because A² and A_z commute but A_y and A_z don't, so they can't be simultaneously diagonalized. So an eigenstate of A_y is not an eigenstate of A_z. Hence, statement C says that the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So according to this, statement C is correct.

Let me think again. So, is this true? Because A² is the same for all states, regardless of the orientation of angular momentum. So, any state is an eigenstate of A². So, any eigenstate of A_y is an eigenstate of A². Because A² commutes with everything, so its eigenvalues are the same regardless.

So, option C's statement would be true. So, that's a possibility.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, I'm not sure what this means. The basis functions of the matrix would be the eigenvectors. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the matrix operator. But I think the statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me think: the matrix operator Ay operates in a two-dimensional space, and its eigenvectors form a basis for this space. So, yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. So option D would be correct.

Wait, but wait. The phrase "basis functions of the matrix operator Ay" could imply that the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, which is true. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions. So D is correct.

But wait, the options are either A,
