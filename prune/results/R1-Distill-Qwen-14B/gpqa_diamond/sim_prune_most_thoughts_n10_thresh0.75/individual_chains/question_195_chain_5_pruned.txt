Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's transiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that it also transits and occults. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm. I remember that for a planet to transit, it needs to pass in front of the star from our point of view. For occultation, it's when the planet passes behind the star, so the starlight blocks the planet's light. So both events require the planet's orbit to be aligned edge-on relative to us, which they already have since they share the same orbital plane and transit.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period. So I think the maximum period would be when both planets are in a configuration that allows their orbital periods to be compatible for mutual transits and occultations. Oh wait, maybe it's about the synodic period or something related to orbital periods?

Wait, maybe not. Another thought: for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough. The impact parameter is given as 0.2 for the first planet. Impact parameter is the distance (in units of star radius) between the center of the star and the center of the planet's path during transit. So if the impact parameter is 0.2, that means the planet's orbit is such that it's close enough to the center for the transit to happen. But for the second planet, as it's larger, maybe the impact parameter can be different?

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period for the second planet so that it also transits. But I'm a bit confused about what's the limiting factor here.

Wait, another approach. The orbital period depends on the semi-major axis of the orbit according to Kepler's third law. Since both planets are around the same star, the mass of the star is the same. So Kepler's law applies.

Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for planets around the same star. So P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So, let
