Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D. 

Let me break down what the target molecule looks like. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, that numbering might be a bit tricky. Benzene rings are numbered based on the substituents' positions. Position 1 is where the ethoxy is, position 2 has the tert-butyl, and position 3 has the nitro. So the substituents are in the order: ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3). That arrangement would require certain directing effects as we add each group.

I remember that substituents on benzene rings can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group and an ortho/para director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, bulky group and also an ortho/para director, but being bulky, it might direct more to para because of steric hindrance in the ortho position.

Wait, actually, tert-butyl is a strong activating, but bulky. So when it's present, incoming electrophiles tend to attack the para position relative to it because the ortho positions are too hindered. But benzene is symmetric, so maybe that's not a big issue here. Hmm.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So if I imagine the benzene ring, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro at 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl. Wait, that arrangement would have the ethoxy and tert-butyl at adjacent positions. Let me think about the steps.

The synthesis starts with benzene. So I need to add these substituents in a specific order because each step's directing effects will influence where the next group goes.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. The nitro group is a meta director, so it's better to add it after other groups that are activating. Because nitro is deactivating, adding it later would make it easier to add other groups first.

Wait, but let me think. The ethoxy group is an activating group, so it's better to add that early. Similarly, the tert-butyl is an activating group as well. So perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's a deactivating group, which would make further reactions harder.

So the plan might be: add ethoxy, add tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, the positions matter. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's say we first add the ethoxy group. Then, when adding the tert-butyl, the ethoxy directs to ortho or para. But since the tert-butyl is bulky, perhaps we can get it to add in a particular position. Then, the nitro group is added in a position that's meta to either of the existing groups.

Wait, maybe I should outline the possible steps. Let me consider each step one by one.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So if I number the benzene ring with ethoxy at position 1, then the tert-butyl is at position 2, and nitro at 3. Let me see the positions:

1: OEt- (ethoxy)
2: t-Bu (tert-butyl)
3: NO2 (nitro)

So substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So their arrangement is 1, 2, 3. That suggests they are all in adjacent positions, but that's only possible if the ring is numbered in a way that they are adjacent. Wait, but that can't be on a benzene ring because each substituent is adjacent, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So, perhaps I should draw it. Imagine a benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So, the three substituents are all meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 is OEt, position 2 is t-Bu, position 3 is nitro. So, OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, which is adjacent to OEt, and nitro at 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu. So all three substituents are in a row. How can that happen?

But wait, when adding substituents, each new group is directed by the existing groups. So let's plan the order of addition.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But let's think about each step. 

1. Adding ethoxy: Benzene reacts with ethyl bromide in the presence of a strong base (like NaOH) to form phenethyl ether. But wait, no, wait. To add an ethoxy group, you typically use an alkyl halide with a base like NaOH in a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, maybe through an SN2 mechanism, but more likely, for benzene, it's through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires strongly activating groups. Wait, no, benzene can't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily. Oh, wait, wait. To introduce an ethoxy group, you would use an alkylation reaction. Benzene can be alkylated using, for example, ethyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid like AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but ethyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide, which is not very reactive for Friedel-Crafts. Maybe we need a better electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, wait. Let me think again. To introduce an ethoxy group, maybe the ethyl group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would give a ethyl group, not an ethoxy. Oh, right. To get an ethoxy group, maybe we need to perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using an ethyl group attached via an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. The target molecule has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So how would that be introduced? One way is through an etherification reaction. For example, benzene can undergo a nucleophilic substitution with ethyl bromide if it's activated. But benzene itself isn't reactive enough. So perhaps we need to make a phenol first, then convert it to an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups, but not ether groups. Oh, wait. Maybe using an ethyl halide with a strong Lewis acid catalyst could lead to alkylation, but in that case, we get an ethyl group attached, not an ethoxy.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a substituent via some kind of substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nitration followed by some other steps, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced as a substituent via a substitution reaction after the ring is activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) reaction. For SNAr, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe if I nitrate benzene first, then introduce the ethoxy group. But wait, nitro is a meta director and deactivating, so that would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution but more towards nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's outline all the substituents and their orders. Another approach: each substituent must be added in a way that their positions are correct considering the directing effects of the previously added groups.

So, the target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine:

Position 1: ethoxy
Position 2: tert-butyl
Position 3: nitro

Wait, but how can three substituents be so close? Because they're all adjacent. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1, 2, and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the order in which substituents are added, and the directing effects each exerts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of substituent addition. Let's think about each substituent's effect:

1. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): activating, ortho/para director.
2. tert-Butyl: bulky, activating, ortho/para director.
3. Nitro (NO2): deactivating, meta director.

So the nitro group is added last because it's deactivating, making the ring less reactive for further substitution. But wait, since it's deactivating, adding it after the other groups would make the ring less reactive for any subsequent reactions, but in this case, the nitro is the last group. So the sequence would be: add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but I'm not sure. It could be possible that nitro is added before some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro first.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent positions. So if I add nitro first, then the ring has a nitro group. Nitro is a meta director. Then, adding ethoxy: the ethoxy is an activating group, which is an ortho/para director. So if the ring has a nitro group, the ethoxy would add in positions meta to the nitro group. Wait, no, because nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But let's see.

Wait, perhaps the order is to add the ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

So, first step: benzene → benzene with ethoxy group. Second step: benzene with ethoxy and tert-butyl. Third step: add nitro.

But how would the positions work? Let me try to imagine each step.

Step 1: Add ethoxy group. Since benzene is being used, the ethoxy can be added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So perhaps I'm wrong—maybe the ethoxy group is added via a different method. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a substitution reaction. But I'm a bit stuck on that point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to have strong electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe if I nitrate benzene first, then convert the nitro group into a better leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis. But that would require an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, which isn't directly applicable here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each of the options includes and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps include adding tert-butyl chloride (AlCl3), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), etc. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: Adds tert-butyl first, then nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then another nitration.

Option C: Adds tert-butyl, then sulfonation, then nitration, etc.

Option D: Starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction; Fe in HCl is likely for some reaction, perhaps for removing a nitro group?), then tert-butyl, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps each option has.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

Looking for which option adds these groups in an order that allows each substituent to direct the next correctly.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. Suppose we add the ethoxy first. But how? Because benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts to add an ether group. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added after another substituent that makes the ring more reactive.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is added via a substitution on a nitro group. For example, if benzene is nitrated, then the nitro group is converted into a nitroso, which can be substituted. But I'm not too familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Let's say benzene is first nitrated (adding nitro group), then the nitro is converted into a better leaving group, like a nitroso (using H2S and then H2SO4?), and then substituted with an ethoxide ion. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the possible steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Let me read the options' steps again.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction to substitute a bromide.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of a nitro group to amine.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

This seems complicated. Let's see what each step does.

Starting with benzene:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl group. So benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitration: tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So the nitro group could be added to ortho or para of the tert-butyl. So the product would be 3-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene or 4-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene, depending on where it goes.

But then step iii) is sulfonation with SO3 and H2SO4. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Adding it after nitration would complicate things.

Hmm, not sure if this is the correct path.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reducing nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe in HCl is typically for dissolving elemental sulfur or for certain reductions. Alternatively, if there's a nitro group present, Fe/HCl can reduce it to an amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol? Or perhaps a different substitution).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, perhaps replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

This seems a bit convoluted. Also, adding multiple nitro groups might not be correct, since the target has only one nitro group.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adds a sulfonic acid group, which is strong deactivating, meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → possible reduction of nitro group.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Again, multiple nitration steps might not fit the target.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro group.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are more about adding substituents in a way that positions are correct.

But let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let me imagine that.

So first nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director.

Then, the next substituent would be added. For example, adding ethoxy. Since nitro is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but ethoxy is an activating group. But wait, nitro is a strong deactivator, so maybe the ethoxy can't be added via electrophilic substitution, so perhaps it's added via a different method.

Wait, but maybe the nitro group is added third. Let me think about adding tert-butyl and ethoxy first, then nitro.

Wait, but the problem is how to introduce the ethoxy group. Since Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether, perhaps we need a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: The ethoxy group could be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be strongly activated with electron-withdrawing groups. So perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but the ethoxy is an activating group, which would make the ring more reactive. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has two nitro groups, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should think about each substitution step in each option.

Looking at option D: the steps are i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) t-Bu alkylation, iv) nitration, v) diazotization, vi) sulfonation, etc.

Wait, if after nitration (i), step ii is Fe/HCl. Fe/HCl is often used for dissolving nitro groups. Wait, nitrobenzene is not directly soluble in Fe/HCl. Alternatively, Fe in HCl is used for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So, perhaps nitration (i) adds a nitro group, step ii reduces it to an amine. Then step iii adds t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. If the ring has an amine group, which is strongly activating, then the t-Bu can be added. But then, adding t-Bu would be directed by the amine group.

Wait, but if the ring has an amine group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director, then adding t-Bu would go to ortho or para. Then, after adding t-Bu, step iv is another nitration. Hmm, but that would add a second nitro group. The target has only one nitro group, so this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve other reactions.

Wait, maybe the first nitration (i) adds a nitro group. Then, step ii (Fe/HCl) reduces it to an amine. Then, step iii adds t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. Then, step iv nitrates again, but that would give two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have. So perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the substituents' positions.

Another approach: considering that the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the t-Bu, or some arrangement like that.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So the nitro is next to the t-Bu and across from the ethoxy. Wait, no, because 1 is ethoxy, 2 is t-Bu, and 3 is nitro. So the positions are adjacent. So they are in a sort of meta arrangement. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct positions are such that each substituent follows the directing of the previous. So perhaps:

1. Add ethoxy group first. Now, the ring has OEt at position 1.

2. Next, add the t-Bu group. Since ethoxy is an ortho/para director, the t-Bu would go to ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But the target has t-Bu at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy. So that would be ortho. But wait, tert-butyl is a bulky group, so perhaps it prefers the para position to avoid steric hindrance. So maybe in this case, it's added para to ethoxy. But the target has t-Bu at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1). So perhaps the t-Bu is added ortho to ethoxy.

3. Then, add nitro group. The ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. So the nitro needs to go to position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (since ethoxy is at 1, meta would be position 4 and 6, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in a position that's meta to both ethoxy and t-Bu. But how?

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro would be added in a position that's meta to one of them. Let's say the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Then, the nitro could be added in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu. But t-Bu is an ortho/para director. So when adding nitro, which is a meta director, perhaps it would go to a position that's meta to the t-Bu. Wait, but t-Bu is an activating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho or para. But nitro is a meta director, so after the ring has both ethoxy and t-Bu, where would the nitro go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after both ethoxy and t-Bu, and the position is determined by the combined directing effects.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu. Let me think.

Nitro group is added to benzene: nitrobenzene. Then, ethoxy is added. Since nitro is a meta director, the ethoxy would go to the meta position relative to nitro. Then, t-Bu would be added, directed by the ethoxy group.

Wait, but ethoxy is an ortho/para director. So if ethoxy is at position 1 relative to nitro's position 4 (if benzene is numbered with nitro at 1, ethoxy would be at 3?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu to ethoxybenzene → which would go to the para position (since t-Bu is bulky and ortho is hindered), so ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 4.

Then, add nitro group. Where would it go? The existing substituents are ethoxy (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). The nitro is a meta director, so it would go where?

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, but it's being added after ethoxy and t-Bu, which are activating groups. So the nitro would be directed by the existing substituents. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, so maybe it's added last.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. If ethoxy is at 1 and t-Bu at 4, then position 3 is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu.

Hmm, perhaps not. This is getting a bit complicated.

Maybe another approach: each substituent must be added in an order that allows each new group to be properly directed. Let's say the ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So step 1: add ethoxy.

But how? As I thought earlier, maybe through Friedel-Crafts, but that adds an alkyl group, not an ether. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to add the ethoxy group is via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Convert nitro to a good leaving group, perhaps via H2S to form a sulfonic acid group? Or via other means.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another idea: maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring. So perhaps after adding a nitro group, which makes the ring electron-deficient, but for substitution, we need a good leaving group. Maybe we can perform a nitro group substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group. For example, nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which can then be displaced by an ethoxide ion. But I'm not exactly sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acetylation followed by something else, but that doesn't directly lead to an ethoxy group.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding the tert-butyl group first, then the nitro, then the ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but how would that work. Let's consider option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-Bu to aniline.

Aniline is a strong activating group, so the t-Bu would add to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. But after reduction, the amine is at position 1, so t-Bu would go to position 2 or 4.

Then, step iv) nitrate again → but this would add a second nitro group, which the target doesn't have. So that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, maybe step ii in option D is not a reduction. Fe/HCl is sometimes used for other purposes, like dissolving the nitro group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe step ii is a hydrolysis of some sort.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro).

So, the nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and across from ethoxy (position 1). 

If I imagine the ring, adding the nitro group at position 3 would require that the previous substituents are in positions that direct the nitro there.

Assuming that the ethoxy is at 1, the t-Bu at 2, then the nitro at 3 would be ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

But wait, t-Bu is an activating, ortho/para director. So if the ring has t-Bu, the nitro would add to ortho or para relative to t-Bu. But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2). So if t-Bu is at 2, the nitro adds at 3 (ortho to t-Bu) or at 1 or 5 (para?), but wait, position 1 is already occupied by ethoxy. So perhaps the nitro goes to 3, ortho to t-Bu.

But how would that happen? Let me think about the steps.

Let's say we first add ethoxy to benzene. As before, I'm not sure how, but let's proceed. So ethoxy is at position 1.

Next, add t-Bu. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So the t-Bu could go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). The target has t-Bu at 2, so that would be ortho to ethoxy. So perhaps the t-Bu is added ortho to ethoxy.

Then, the next step is nitration. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Nitration would be directed by the strongest director. Both ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, ortho/para directors. So which directs where?

In such a case, the substituent that's more activating would direct. Since both are activating, perhaps the directing is a combination. Alternatively, the t-Bu is bulkier, so the nitro group might add to the position that's less hindered.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group adds to position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu. But why would that happen? Because t-Bu is a strong ortho/para director. So the nitro group would add to the ortho or para positions relative to t-Bu. So, t-Bu is at 2, ortho would be 1 and 3, but position 1 is already occupied by ethoxy. So nitro would have to go to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu) or position 6 (para to t-Bu). But the target has nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-Bu.

So, the nitration step would add nitro to position 3.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu → ethoxy(1)-t-Bu(2) benzene.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

Now, how to introduce these groups via the given options.

Looking at the options, which one follows this sequence.

Option C's steps:

i) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu to amine (aniline), which is activating.

iv) Nitrate again → add another nitro.

Hmm, not matching.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Not the right path.

Option A:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazotize.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match this sequence. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: the target molecule has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. So perhaps the order is: t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after nitro is added. So:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene → t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro added, directed by t-Bu (ortho/para). So nitro could be at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu at 2) or position 4 (para?).

Wait, t-Bu is at 2, so para would be position 6. Ortho would be 1 and 3. If nitro is added at 3, then step 3 would be adding ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a substitution reaction. Suppose after adding nitro at 3, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and nitro at 3. Then, adding ethoxy via nucleophilic substitution requires a good leaving group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an alkyl halide in presence of a strong base after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene.

2. Nitrate the ring → nitro at 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

3. Then, introduce ethoxy via a substitution. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is present. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate (adds a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating, meta director).

iii) HNO3 → nitrate. The ring has t-Bu and sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid is a strong meta director. So nitration would be directed by sulfonic acid. So nitro would go to position where? But the target has nitro at 3.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → would go ortho or para to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group, which doesn't fit.

So probably not.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) sulfonate → adds SO3 group.

iv) diazotize.

v) H3O+, H2O → hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

So after these steps, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy?

Wait, if step iii adds a sulfonic acid group, then step vi uses NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 reaction. So perhaps the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy.

But how?

Hmm, if the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonic acid, perhaps the sulfonic acid is replaced with ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so that would require a substitution.

Wait, but the target has nitro, t-Bu, and ethoxy. So if option A's steps lead to that, maybe.

Let me go through option A's steps:

Starting with benzene.

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → benzene becomes t-Bu-benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → so nitro group adds. Where? t-Bu is an ortho/para director. So nitro could be at position 3 (ortho) or position 5 (para). Let's say it's at position 3.

So now, structure is t-Bu at position 2 and nitro at position 3.

Wait, numbering is a bit ambiguous, but let's assume that.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Where? The sulfonation would occur in the activated positions. But the ring now has t-Bu (activating) and nitro (deactivating). So the sulfonate would add where? Sulfonation is a strong deactivating group, meta director. So directing would be influenced by the existing groups. The t-Bu is at 2, nitro at 3.

Hmm, perhaps the sulfonate adds at position 6, which is para to nitro and meta to t-Bu.

Then step iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But the ring has a nitro group, so maybe this step isn't applicable. Or perhaps it's for a different group.

Step v) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

Step vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis again. Maybe to convert a nitro group to something else?

Step vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution. Perhaps replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

Wait, but where would the ethoxy go? If the sulfonic acid group was added at position 6, and then replaced, perhaps the ethoxy would end up at 6.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think about which option ends up with the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Another approach: look for the presence of ethoxy via a substitution reaction, which requires a good leaving group. So perhaps one of the options involves replacing a nitro group with ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps a nitro group is converted into an amine, which is then used for substitution.

Wait, in option B:

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again, but that would add another nitro.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, option D:

iii) add t-Bu after nitro is reduced to amine.

Wait, adding t-Bu to aniline (which is a strong activating group) would direct the t-Bu to ortho or para positions.

If the amine is at position 1, the t-Bu would go to position 2 or 4.

After adding t-Bu, step iv is nitration again, which would add another nitro group. But the target has only one nitro, so this is unlikely.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate → adds SO3 group.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, no, that seems to add multiple nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's steps:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate → another nitro group.

Hmm, again, seems to add more nitro groups.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about the possible products of each step in the options.

Looking back at the target, the substituents are ethoxy (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

So, the ethoxy must be introduced before or after t-Bu, and nitro after both, or in some other order.

Wait, the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution. So perhaps one of the steps involves substituting a bromide with ethoxide.

Looking at the options, each has a step with NaOH and EtBr (option A, B, C, D step vii or viii). For example, step vii in option A is NaOH/EtBr. So perhaps that's a substitution reaction.

If that's the case, then in the step where EtBr is used with NaOH, it's an SN2 reaction where a bromide is replaced by ethoxy.

So, perhaps the ring has a bromide group that is replaced with ethoxy in that step.

So, in which option is a bromide introduced earlier?

Looking at the options:

Option A: step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is a diazotization step, typically for amines. Then step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So perhaps after a diazo compound is formed, it is hydrolyzed to a phenol (step v: H3O+ and heat), then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, let me think. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For instance, hydrolysis with dilute acid can give phenol. If after that, we have a phenol group, which is a strong activating group, then treating with NaOH and EtBr (which is an SN2 reagent) would substitute the phenol's oxygen with ethoxy.

Wait, but phenol is a strong activating group, so if we have a phenol, adding ethoxy via substitution would require a good leaving group, which phenol doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps the phenol is converted into a better leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves introducing a nitro group, then substituting it with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → adds t-Bu ortho or para to amine.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro group.

Hmm, but that gives two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Alternatively, perhaps in option B, after adding t-Bu and nitro, and then reducing nitro to amine (step iii), then nitrate again (iv), which might not fit.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about which option has the correct order of substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate → adds SO3 group.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

In option A, after adding t-Bu and nitro, then sulfonate, then diazotize, hydrolyze, then substitute.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the order of substituents.

Another approach: in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and across from ethoxy (position 1). So the nitro is meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the t-Bu.

To have the nitro at 3, perhaps the ethoxy is added last.

Wait, so the order could be:

1. Add t-Bu → benzene becomes t-Bu benzene.

2. Add nitro → directed by t-Bu to position 3 (ortho) or 5 (para). Let's say nitro at 3.

3. Add ethoxy → directed by t-Bu and nitro. But nitro is deactivating, so it's a meta director. So where would ethoxy go?

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. I think I need to choose the correct option based on the steps.

Wait, I'll try to summarize:

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

The sequence of adding substituents should be such that each new group is directed correctly by the existing groups.

The ethoxy group must be added after t-Bu and nitro? Or before? I'm not certain.

Another observation: the ethoxy group is an activating group, so it's better to add it after deactivating groups to keep the ring reactive. But adding nitro (deactivating) after ethoxy would make the ring less reactive for nitration, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added last via substitution.

Wait, looking at the options, which option has a substitution step (like NaOH/EtBr) that could introduce the ethoxy group.

Looking at option C:

Steps include adding t-Bu, sulfonate, nitrate, reduce, diazotize, nitrate again, hydrolyze, dilute H2SO4, and then NaOH/EtBr.

So, perhaps the ethoxy is added in the last step via SN2 substitution. So the ring would have a leaving group, like bromide, which is replaced by ethoxy.

But in which step is the bromide introduced?

Hmm, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, another thought: the ethoxy group might be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is converted into a better leaving group. For example, nitro → nitroso → which can be displaced by ethoxide.

But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Another approach: think about the positions. Each substituent must be added in a way that their directing effects allow the next substituent to be added in the correct position.

Assuming the correct order is ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So:

1. Ethoxy added → directs next group to ortho or para.

2. t-Bu added → ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

3. Nitro added → meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu.

So, in the third step, nitro would be added at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1).

Looking at the options, which one follows this sequence.

Option C:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

So in this option, t-Bu is added first, then sulfonate, then nitrate. Doesn't fit.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) reduce.

iii) add t-Bu.

iv) nitrate again.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazotize.

v) H3O+.

vi) hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

So after adding t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonate, then various steps, including substitution.

Perhaps the substitution step replaces the sulfonate group with ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group. So if the sulfonate is replaced, then the ethoxy would be where the sulfonate was. But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1.

So if the sulfonate was at position 6, substitution would put ethoxy at 6, which is not the target's position.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the substitution.

Wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, t-Bu at 2.

So perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene → t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

3. Add ethoxy via substitution → ethoxy at 1 (meta to nitro? Or ortho to t-Bu?).

Wait, but how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps option A's steps lead to the correct structure.

Looking back at option A:

i) add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) sulfonate → adds SO3 at 4.

iv) diazotize → perhaps converting a group to a diazonium salt.

v) H3O+ → hydrolysis to phenol.

vi) hydrolyze again → maybe more substitution.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

So after substitution, the SO3 group is replaced with ethoxy, placing ethoxy at position 4.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1.

So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

After all this thinking, I think the correct option is option D. Because it starts with nitration, then reduction, then t-Bu addition, which could place substituents correctly. But I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis focuses on the order of adding these substituents and the directing effects of each group during the synthesis.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituent Properties**:
   - **Ethoxy (OCH₂CH₃)**: Activating, ortho/para director.
   - **tert-Butyl (t-Bu)**: Activating, ortho/para director (bulkiness may favor para).
   - **Nitro (NO₂)**: Deactivating, meta director.

2. **Target Structure**:
   - Substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro).
   - The nitro group at position 3 is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1).

3. **Challenges**:
   - Introducing the ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation is not feasible because it adds an alkyl group, not an ether.
   - Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (for ethoxy) requires a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which is not initially present.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds t-Bu to benzene.
  2. Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to t-Bu.
  3. Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group.
  4. Diazotization and hydrolysis likely convert a group to a phenol.
  5. Substitution with NaOH/EtBr replaces a leaving group with ethoxy.
- **Issues**: The sulfonic acid group added in step iii is not present in the target molecule, and the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

#### **Option B**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu to benzene.
  2. Nitration adds a nitro group.
  3. Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
  4. Nitration adds another nitro group.
  5. Diazotization and hydrolysis follow.
  6. Substitution with NaOH/EtBr adds ethoxy.
- **Issues**: The addition of multiple nitro groups does not match the target structure, which has only one nitro group.

#### **Option C**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu to benzene.
  2. Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group.
  3. Nitration adds a nitro group.
  4. Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
  5. Diazotization and nitration follow.
  6. Hydrolysis and substitution with NaOH/EtBr add ethoxy.
- **Issues**: The sulfonic acid group added in step ii is not present in the target molecule, and the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for the substituents.

#### **Option D**:
- **Steps**:
  1. Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
  2. Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu to the amine.
  4. Nitration adds another nitro group.
  5. Diazotization and hydrolysis follow.
  6. Substitution with NaOH/EtBr adds ethoxy.
- **Issues**: The addition of multiple nitro groups does not match the target structure, which has only one nitro group.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option D** comes closer because it involves nitration, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which could potentially lead to the correct substituent positions. Despite the presence of ambiguities and inconsistencies, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible answer.

**Answer: D**
