Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says the magnetic field is along the Oz axis and has a small m value. Oh, wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, right? So if m is small, that probably affects the energy levels somehow. The magnetic field B is given as 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, actually. I remember that 1 Tesla is about the same strength as a strong magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, which is significant.

The problem is asking me to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy delta E of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range, like the Balmer series in hydrogen. That's the wavelength for the transition from n=2 to n=1, I think. Wait, no, n=2 to n=1 would be a higher energy transition, but wait, the Balmer series is n=2 to n=1, giving off a photon in the ultraviolet. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the series. Oh, wait, 0.486 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. Yeah, that's correct.

So the transition energy delta E can be calculated using the wavelength. The formula is delta E = hc / lambda. Let me remember the constants: h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is the speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. So let's compute delta E.

Wait, lambda is given as 0.4861 micrometers. Let me convert that to meters. 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.4861e-6 meters. So delta E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, I think I should express this in electron volts because energies are often easier to handle that way. To convert joules to eV, I remember 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So delta E in eV would be approximately 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high, but I think the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen is about 10.2 eV, but H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which is about 1.89 eV. Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = Let's compute the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.9878 / 4.861 ≈ 0.4089, so 0.4089e-18 J, which is 4.089e-19 J. Then converting to eV: 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but I think the actual energy for H-alpha is about 1.89 eV. Maybe I should check the wavelength again. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is indeed in the visible spectrum and corresponds to the H-alpha line. Let me think: the Rydberg constant gives the energy levels. The formula for energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_2 is -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV, E_3 is -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.51 eV. So delta E for n=3 to n=2 is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV. The absolute value is about 1.89 eV. So my calculation gave 2.55 eV, but the actual is 1.89 eV. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the constants. Let me recalculate delta E.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for h. Let me double-check. Planck's constant is h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s, and c is 299,792,458 m/s approximately 2.998e8 m/s. So let me compute hc correctly.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25, but the exact calculation: 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ 19.8646. So 19.8646e-26 J·m (since 1e-34 * 1e8 = 1e-26). So hc ≈ 1.98646e-25 J·m.

Wait, no, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25, yes. So hc = 1.98646e-25 J·m. So then hc / lambda = 1.98646e-25 / (0.4861e-6 m) = 1.98646e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let's compute that.

1.98646e-25 divided by 4.861e-7 is approximately 4.085e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.085e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. But wait, I thought the transition was 1.89 eV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength. Did I mix up meters and micrometers? Wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm. Oh wait, maybe the transition is from n=3 to n=2, which is 1.89 eV. So why is my calculation giving a higher value?

Oh, wait, the formula E_photon = hc / lambda. So the photon's energy is 2.55 eV. The transition energy delta E is the energy difference, which is 1.89 eV. So that seems off. What's going on here? Oh, perhaps because I'm using the Rydberg formula which accounts for the inverse square, but regardless, perhaps the exact value isn't needed for this problem. Maybe the order of magnitude is more important. So delta E is about 2 eV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should just accept that my calculation is correct for the given wavelength.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling in atoms... I think in hydrogen, the main effect is due to the spin-orbit interaction, but wait, in the absence of an external magnetic field, the paramagnetic effect is due to the magnetic interaction of the electron's spin with the nucleus. But wait, the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term' which might refer to the Zeeman effect. Oh, right, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the Zeeman term.

Wait, the Zeeman effect arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron (or nucleus) and the external magnetic field. For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, in the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is due to the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H_Zeeman = -μ·B = -g μ_B m_s B, assuming B is in the z-direction. Wait, but in this case, the problem is about orbital magnetic quantum number m, so perhaps it's the orbital contribution.

Wait, no, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m_l is the component. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = -μ_B (m_l / l), because the orbital g-factor is approximately 1. So the Zeeman energy for the orbital part would be H_Zeeman = -μ_orbital · B. So H_Zeeman = μ_B * m_l * B, because the orbital moment is opposite in direction, so the dot product would be negative times m_l μ_B. Wait, let me think again. The orbital magnetic moment is μ = g_l μ_B (L / ħ ), where g_l is approximately 1. So μ = μ_B (L/ħ) * g_l. Since L has components L_z = m_l ħ, so μ_z = μ_B m_l g_l.

Then, the energy is H = -μ · B. If B is along z, then H = -μ_z B. So H = -μ_B m_l g_l B. But wait, paramagnetic coupling here refers to the effect due to the electron's orbital motion in the magnetic field. So the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B m_l B.

Wait, but the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which I think is the same as the Zeeman term. So the expectation value of H_Zeeman is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B m B.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. So if m is small, then the energy shift would be small. But wait, what is the value of m? For hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be 0,1,2,...,n-1. For each l, m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. So if m is small, like m=0 or m=1, then the energy shift would be small.

Wait, but the magnetic field here is 1 Tesla, which is a strong field. Let me compute the order of magnitude of the Zeeman energy shift compared to the transition energy delta E.

So the paramagnetic term, the Zeeman energy, is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B m B. Let's compute μ_B. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (e ħ )/(2 m_e), where e is the electron charge (1.6e-19 C), ħ is hbar = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and m_e is the electron mass (9.109e-31 kg).

So μ_B = (1.6e-19 C * 1.05457e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg). Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 1.6e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.687e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg ≈ 1.8218e-30 kg.

So μ_B ≈ (1.687e-53) / (1.8218e-30) ≈ 9.26e-24 J/T.

Wait, because units: Tesla is kg/(C·s). Let me see: units of μ_B: (C)(J·s) / (kg) ) → J·s * C / kg. But J is kg·m²/s², so:

(C) * (kg·m²/s² * s) ) / kg ) → C·m²/s². Which is (C·m²/s²) → same as (kg·m^2/s^2) * (C/kg), so (kg·m²/s²) * (C/kg) ) = (C·m²/s²). But that's equivalent to (V·m)·m²/s² → Hmm, maybe I should just take the numerical value.

Wait, the Bohr magneton is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. So μ_B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T.

So the Zeeman energy is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m * B. Let's plug in the numbers.

We have B = 1 T. So ΔE_zeeman = 9.27e-24 J/T * m * 1 T = 9.27e-24 * m J.

But what is m here? The orbital magnetic quantum number m ranges from -l to +l. For example, for l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1. The problem states that m is small, so perhaps m is 1, but perhaps the maximum m is l, so for l=1, m=1.

Wait, but the problem says 'm is small'. So perhaps m is zero, but if m=0, the energy shift is zero. That can't be right. Hmm, but the problem says 'parallel to Oz' and 'small values of m', so maybe m=0 or m=1. Let's take m=1 as the maximum for some l.

So ΔE_zeeman = 9.27e-24 J * 1 = 9.27e-24 J. Let's convert that to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. That's about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but earlier I calculated delta E (the transition energy) as approximately 2.55 eV. So now I'm comparing ΔE_zeeman (5.8e-5 eV) to delta E (2.55 eV).

So 5.8e-5 eV is much, much smaller than 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait a second: in the hydrogen atom, the main energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So the spacing between levels is on the order of a few eV. The transition from n=3 to n=2 is about 1.89 eV, as I thought earlier.

So the Zeeman shift for m=1 is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than 1.89 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the expectation value of the paramagnetic coupling (which is the Zeeman term) is much less than delta E.

Wait, but wait: is there any other contribution to the paramagnetic term? Because in hydrogen, the electron's spin can also interact with the magnetic field. The spin g-factor is about 2, so the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B / 2. So for spin-up, m_s = 1/2, so the Zeeman energy would be H = -μ · B = -μ_s B. So μ_s = (2 * μ_B) * (1/2) ) = μ_B. So H = -μ_B * (1/2) * B. So for m_s=1/2, H = - (μ_B * 1/2) * B. So ΔE = (μ_B * (1/2)) * B = (9.27e-24 J/T) * 0.5 * 1 T = 4.635e-24 J, which is about 2.9e-5 eV. That's even smaller than the orbital contribution for m=1. So the orbital term with m=1 gives about 5.8e-5 eV, and the spin term is about 2.9e-5 eV. So either way, the paramagnetic coupling is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Oh! Wait, I might have confused paramagnetic and diamagnetic terms. Paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, so it's about the electron's magnetic moment. But the problem says paramagnetic coupling term, which I think refers to the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the external field. So in this case, the orbital contribution is part of the paramagnetic effect.

So, if the paramagnetic term (ΔE_zeeman) is about 5.8e-5 eV (for m=1) and the transition energy is about 1.89 eV, then the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the expectation value of H_paramag is much less than delta E.

So the options are:

A) <H> = ΔE → same order, no.

B) <H> >> ΔE → no, it's much smaller.

C) <H> << ΔE → yes.

D) <H> > ΔE → no.

So the correct answer would be option C: the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than delta E.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Did I make a mistake in the order of magnitude?

I have:

ΔE_zeeman ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

ΔE ≈ 1.89 eV.

So 5.8e-5 is 5.8 x 10^-5 eV, which is 58 micro-eV. 1.89 eV is 1,890,000 micro-eV.

So 58 is way smaller than a million, so yes, <<.

Therefore, the answer is option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and perform the relevant calculations.

### Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))
The transition energy is determined using the wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu m = 486.1 \, nm \). The energy of a photon is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This corresponds to the energy difference between the \( n=3 \) and \( n=2 \) levels in the hydrogen atom.

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \))
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect, which is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B m B,
\]

where:
- \( \mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number,
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).

For small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.27 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
