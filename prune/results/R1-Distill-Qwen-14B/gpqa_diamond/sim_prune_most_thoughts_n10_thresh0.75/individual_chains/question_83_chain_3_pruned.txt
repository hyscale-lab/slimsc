Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So here, we're mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water. So the volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (20 + 20). So the initial concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M, right? Because when you double the volume, concentration halves. So 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M.

Wait, so the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. The next step is to titrate this with NaOH. Titration means neutralization, so NaOH (a strong base) will react with the acetic acid.

For the titration process, I think the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me first tackle the equivalence point because that seems straightforward.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

So I need to calculate the pH of the sodium acetate solution.

But wait, how much sodium acetate is there? Let's think about the moles first.

Original acetic acid volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, and we're going to the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH needed will be the same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH required at equivalence can be found using M = moles/volume. So volume = moles / M. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So the total solution at equivalence point would be 40 +
