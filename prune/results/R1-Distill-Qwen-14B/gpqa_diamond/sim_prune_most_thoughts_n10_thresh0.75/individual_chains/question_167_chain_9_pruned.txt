Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state, which I remember is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So first, maybe I should plug these values into the normalization constant. Let me calculate N first.

Wait, let's compute N. So N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) * e^(-2 alpha²). Let's compute each part.

Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. Because sin(-x)= -sin x. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Alpha is 0.5, so 2 alpha squared is 2*(0.5)^2 = 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So putting it all together, N squared is 1 + (-1)*(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is the square root of 0.3935. Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but wait a second. When you square N, you get that value, so N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. Hmm, okay.

Now, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. But wait, coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So when you take a superposition of two coherent states, you get a non-Gaussian state. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and we need to calculate its non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure.

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, relative entropy... Oh, I think this is the relative entropy of entanglement, but in this context, it's being used to measure non-Gaussianity. The idea is that the non-Gaussian state (rho) is compared to a Gaussian state (tau). The difference in their entropies gives a measure of non-Gaussianity.

But how do I compute this? I think I need to find rho and tau, compute their von Neumann entropies, and then find the difference.

Wait, but first, what is tau? The reference Gaussian state. For a superposition state like this, what's the most similar Gaussian state? I remember that for a state like |alpha>, which is a coherent state,
