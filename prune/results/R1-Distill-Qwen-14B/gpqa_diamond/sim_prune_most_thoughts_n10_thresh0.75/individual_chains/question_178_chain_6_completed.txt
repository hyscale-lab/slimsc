Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the Lagrangian given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that the gamma matrices are part of the Dirac algebra. So this must be some kind of interaction term in a quantum field theory.

The question is asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options give different combinations, so I need to figure out both parts.

First, I think I should find the mass dimension of each part of the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4, because when you integrate it over four dimensions (d^4x), which has dimension -4, the action (which is ∫ L d^4x) must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.

Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian itself is a density, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So every term in the Lagrangian must have [term]_M = 4.

Now, the term given is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break this down.

Each field has a mass dimension. Fermion fields like ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac spinor ψ has dimension 3/2. Right, because the action is ∫ ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x, which must be dimensionless. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So the term ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension 4 (since the Lagrangian density has dimension 4). ψ and ψ̄ each have dimension 3/2, and the derivative adds 1. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4, which works.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, right? Because they are part of the spinor representation and don't carry any mass dimension. So [γ_μ, γ_ν] would also be dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is (i/2) times something dimensionless, so σ_{μν} has no mass dimension. So when we have ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. But wait, σ is tensor, which is antisymmetric, but dimensionally it's just a product of gammas, so no dimension.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism is something like ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term in the Lagrangian for A is like (∂A)^2, and each ∂ brings 1, each A is dimension 1. So each term in F is ∂μ Aν, which is dimension 1+1=2. So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have mass dimension 4 (since it's part of the Lagrangian). So let's compute the dimension of each part:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

This needs to equal 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would rule out options B and D, which have [κ] =1.

Now, about renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the terms in the Lagrangian have dimension ≤4. Because higher dimension terms would require higher loops for renormalization, making the theory nonrenormalizable and typically leading to issues like non-predictivity at high energies.

In our case, the term we have is part of the interaction Lagrangian (since it's L_int). The term is dimension 4 because the entire term is in the Lagrangian, which must be dimension 4. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the term is part of L, which is dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ F is dimension 4, because the overall is the Lagrangian, which must be dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Wait, but some terms could have higher dimension, but in a renormalizable theory, you don't have any terms with higher dimension. So if all interaction terms are of dimension ≤4, then the theory is renormalizable. But if any term has dimension >4, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

In this case, our term is dimension 4, so the interaction is renormalizable. Wait, but wait: the term itself is dimension 4, so the coupling constant's dimension is negative. But for renormalizability, the Lagrangian terms must have dimension ≤4. Since this term is dimension 4, the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but the term is of dimension 4, so it's allowed, so the theory is renormalizable.

But wait, another point: the dimension of the coupling.

Wait, the coupling is κ, which has dimension -1. So when you write a term in the Lagrangian like κ φ^4, the dimension would be [κ] + 4 [φ] = -1 + 4*(something). But in our case, the term is dimensionally 4, which is correct.

But in terms of renormalization, the fact that the coupling has a negative dimension could imply that the theory is nonrenormalizable? Wait, no. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling constant relates to the superficial degree of divergence of the theory. For a theory with coupling constant λ with mass dimension d, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (d * n), where n is the number of vertices in a Feynman diagram.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In four spacetime dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4 for the theory to be renormalizable. If the term has dimension exactly 4, it's called renormalizable; if higher, then not. So in our case, the term is dimension 4. So the interaction is renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another point: the coupling's dimension. For example, in φ^4 theory, the coupling λ has dimension (4-4) = 0 because the term is λ φ^4. Each φ has dimension 1, so 4*1=4, so [λ] = 0.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimension: as we did earlier, it's 4. So the product of the fields and the coupling must give 4.

Wait, but the overall Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term in it must have dimension 4.

So if the term is dimension 4, and the coupling κ has dimension -1, that's okay. Because the fields contribute enough dimensions to compensate. So the term is allowed in a renormalizable theory.

Wait, but wait again. For example, a term like ψψψψ would have each ψ with dimension 3/2. Four ψs give 6. So the coupling λ must have dimension -2, so that 4*(3/2) + [λ] = 4 → 6 + [λ] =4 → [λ]=-2. So that's a dimension 6 operator, which would make the theory nonrenormalizable. But in this case, our term is dimension 4, so it's okay.

So, putting it all together: [κ]=-1, and the term is dimension 4. So the theory is renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. That matches.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. No, [κ] is -1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. No, because the term is dim 4.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. Wrong on both counts.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian
In natural units (\( \hbar = c = 1 \)), the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because the action \( S = \int d^4x \, \mathcal{L} \) must be dimensionless. Therefore, every term in the Lagrangian must also have mass dimension 4.

### Step 2: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
- The Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) (e.g., for electromagnetism) has mass dimension \( [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2 \).
- The commutator \( [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) involves gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is also dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).

### Step 3: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4. Breaking it down:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension \( \leq 4 \). In this case, the interaction term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension 4, which satisfies the condition for renormalizability. Therefore, the theory is renormalizable.

### Step 5: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), the theory is renormalizable. This matches our analysis.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), the theory is renormalizable. Incorrect because \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \).
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), the theory is not renormalizable. Incorrect because the theory is renormalizable.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), the theory is not renormalizable. Incorrect on both counts.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
