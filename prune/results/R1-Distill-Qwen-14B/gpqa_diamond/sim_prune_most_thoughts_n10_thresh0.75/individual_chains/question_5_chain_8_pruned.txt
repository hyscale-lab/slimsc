Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented this way. So the operator P is probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The problem is asking for the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm. So I need to find a vector |v> such that when P acts on it, the result is (ħ/2) times |v>. Oh, wait, no, because the operator is P, so P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, no, more accurately, the operator P is the vector operator. So when it's given in terms of components, the operator P·n would be the component along direction n. But wait, the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So the operator is P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane, right? So θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the question just says to find the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. So the operator in question is P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down the components:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P·n is (n_x (
