Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor. So the spin state is a column vector [3i; 4], right? So it's a vector in a two-dimensional space, which makes sense because electrons have spin-1/2, so their spin states are in a two-level system.

The task is to find the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are given in terms of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. Let me write that down. 

The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], as per the note in the question. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. 

To find the expectation value of S_y, I need to compute the expectation value of the operator. The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by S_y matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. Mathematically, that's ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, the state vector given is (3i, 4). So in column vector form, it's [3i; 4]. Let me call this vector ψ. So ψ = [3i; 4]. 

But wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Because the expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized. Alternatively, perhaps the given state isn't normalized, so I'll need to normalize it before doing the calculation. Because otherwise, the expectation value won't be correct.

So let's compute the norm (or the squared magnitude) of ψ. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2. The magnitude of 3i is 3, so squared is 9. Magnitude of 4 is 4, squared is 16. So 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, to normalize ψ, I need to divide each component by 5. So the normalized state ψ_normalized is [3i/5; 4/5].

Wait, but sometimes when the state is given, it's already considered as the normalized state unless stated otherwise. Hmm, but in this problem, it's given as (3i, 4), so I should probably go through the normalization step. Because the expectation value depends on the normalized state.

Okay, moving on. So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be:

⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5^2) times [ψ^† σ_y ψ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach it step by step.

First, write down the matrix S_y:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The state vector ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ^† (the conjugate transpose) is [ -3, 4i ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait: ψ is [3i; 4], so the conjugate of each component is (-3, 4i). So ψ^† is the row vector [-3, 4i].

So to compute ψ^† σ_y ψ, let's compute that.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. 

σ_y is:

0  -i
i   0

Multiplying σ_y by ψ (which is [3i; 4]) gives:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. i² is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, multiply ψ^† by this result.

ψ^† is [-3, 4i].

So ψ^† (σ_y ψ) is [-3, 4i] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So the dot product is (-3)*(-4i) + (4i)*(-3).

Calculating each term:

-3 * -4i = 12i.

4i * -3 = -12i.

Adding them together: 12i -12i = 0.

Wait, that's zero? That can't be right. Because the expectation value can't be zero unless the state is symmetric in some way. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait wait, let me check the multiplication again.

Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and ψ is [3i; 4].

So σ_y ψ is:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second element: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then ψ^† is [ -3,
