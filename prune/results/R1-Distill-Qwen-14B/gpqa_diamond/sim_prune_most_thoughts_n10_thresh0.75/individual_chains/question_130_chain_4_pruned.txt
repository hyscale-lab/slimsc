Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, right? And neutral hydrogen clouds can absorb this light. So when a quasar's light passes through such a cloud, the hydrogen absorbs the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. This is probably what causes the absorption lines we observe in quasar spectra.

Wait, but the question is about the redshift. Redshift tells us how much the universe has expanded since the light left the object. So higher redshift means further away and earlier in the universe.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far ultraviolet. But optical telescopes on the ground can't see that because the Earth's atmosphere blocks UV light. So the question is, when does the Lyman alpha line shift into the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can detect it?

I think that's the key point here. If the quasar's light is redshifted such that the Lyman alpha absorption line moves into the optical part of the spectrum, then that line can be observed. Otherwise, it's beyond what optical telescopes can see.

So the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). The optical range for ground-based telescopes is roughly 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red). So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be in that range.

Redshift z is defined by the formula: lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z)

So we want lambda_obs to be >= 400 nm (since that's the start of the optical range; beyond that is UV, which we can't see from the ground). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So when the light is redshifted, the observed wavelength increases.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't see below about 300 nm or so because the atmosphere absorbs that. So maybe the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical window that telescopes can capture. Let me think.

Wait, but let me get this straight: If an object has a redshift z, then its emitted wavelength is stretched by (1+z). So if the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, then when it's redshifted by z, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

We need that observed wavelength to be within the range that optical telescopes can observe. Ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (which is UV) because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the Lyman alpha line, after redshift, must be above 300 nm to be visible in the optical range. Or wait, noâ€”because the optical range is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), so maybe the line needs to be in that range.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is far UV. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha line would be redshifted into the optical range. So when is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms within the optical range (like 400 nm to 700 nm)?

So we can set up the equation:

1216 * (1 + z) >= 400 nm (since 400 nm is violet, the start of optical). But wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait. No, because 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. So when you redshift it, it becomes longer. So let's compute z when 1216*(1+z) = 4000 Angstroms (which is 400 nm). Wait, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm. Oh, wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

So,
