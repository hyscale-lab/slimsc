Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, propene is more common in such reactions. So, A is propene.

Next, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, I think the addition is across the double bond. So propene would add Br2 to become 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually causes elimination reactions. So the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons (vicinal dihalide). When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr and form an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would give back propene, but wait, maybe it could form another isomer.

Wait, no, propene has only one structure, so when B (CH2BrCH2BrCH3) is treated with KOH, the elimination would result in propene again. Wait, wait, wait.
