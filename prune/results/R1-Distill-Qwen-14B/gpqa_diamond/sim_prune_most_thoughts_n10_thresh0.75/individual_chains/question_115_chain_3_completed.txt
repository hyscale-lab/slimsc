Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's understand the setup. There's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma being 4 means the electron is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. 

Then, there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Positrons are the antimatter counterparts of electrons, so they have the same mass and charge magnitude but opposite in sign. 

When they collide, they annihilate each other and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. So both are going to the right, but one is upwards and the other downwards, making some angle with the horizontal.

The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm, I think I should approach this using conservation laws—specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the annihilation happens in a collision, the total energy and momentum before must equal those after.

Let me break it down.

First, calculate the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Both have the same rest mass, so each contributes mc². The rest mass energy for an electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since they're annihilating, their rest mass energy will be converted into the photons' energy. But wait, the problem says that both photons have the same energy, so each photon must have an energy of (electron rest energy + positron rest energy)/2. Wait, no, wait. The electron and positron have the same rest mass, so together, their rest mass is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, the total energy isn't just rest mass because they are moving. They have kinetic energy as well, which comes from their Lorentz factors.

So I need to consider their relativistic energies. The total energy is gamma * m c² for each.

So for the electron: gamma_e =4, so energy E_e = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.
For the positron: gamma_p=2, so E_p = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but wait, wait. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron. So their momenta are opposite, but I should consider direction when calculating momentum.

The electron is moving to the right (from left) so its momentum is in +x. The positron is moving to the left (from the right), so its momentum is in -x direction.

Wait, the problem says the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left, their velocities are towards each other. So their momenta are opposite.

So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But wait, in relativistic terms, momentum p = gamma * m * v, but v is in the direction of motion.

But let me think about the direction. Electrons move left to right (from left), positron moves right to left (from right). So their momentum vectors are opposite.

So let's compute each momentum.

For the electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since gamma is given, perhaps it's easier to remember that p = gamma m v, but v can be expressed as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, maybe we can compute beta instead, where beta is v/c.

Beta_e is v_e/c. Since gamma_e =4, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e^2) → 1/4 = sqrt(1 - beta_e^2) → 1/16 = 1 - beta_e² → beta_e² = 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c. 

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2 → gamma=2, so 2=1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2) → 1/2 = sqrt(1 - beta_p^2) → 1/4 =1 -beta_p^2 → beta_p^2= 3/4 → beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left, which is the negative x direction. So its beta is negative? Or maybe we can take magnitudes and then assign direction later.

So for momentum, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So let's compute the absolute values and then sum as vectors.

Electron's momentum magnitude: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (beta_e c) =4 m_e c beta_e.

Similarly, positron's momentum magnitude: p_p= gamma_p * m_e * v_p. Since v_p is to the left, v_p = -beta_p c.

So p_e = 4 m_e c beta_e (positive x direction)
p_p = 2 m_e c beta_p (but in negative x direction, so p_p = -2 m_e c beta_p)

Wait, but actually, the positron is moving from the right towards the collision point, so its velocity is in the negative x direction. So its momentum is negative.

So the total initial momentum (vector) is p_initial = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

So let's compute the numerical values.

Compute beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/16)) = sqrt(15/16)) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

beta_p = sqrt(1 - (1/4)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So p_e = 4 * m_e c * (0.9682) → 4 * 0.9682 m_e c ≈ 3.8728 m_e c.

p_p = 2 * m_e c * 0.8660 → 1.732 m_e c. But since it's in the negative x direction, p_p = -1.732 m_e c.

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408 m_e c in the positive x direction.

Wait, but wait a second. The positron's direction is from the right, which is moving to the left. So the electron is moving right (from left), the positron is moving left (from right). So their velocities are towards each other.

Thus, the electron's momentum is positive (right), the positron's is negative (left). So when they collide, the total initial momentum is p_e (right) plus p_p (left, which is negative).

So p_initial = (3.8728) - (1.732) = 2.1408 m_e c in the right direction. So the system's total momentum before collision is 2.1408 m_e c in the positive x direction.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Because the positron is moving from the right, so before collision, it's moving to the left. So the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (right, positive) plus p_p (left, negative). So yes, as I did before.

So p_initial = 3.8728 - 1.732 ≈ 2.1408 m_e c in the +x direction.

Now, after the collision, two photons are produced with equal energies. Each photon's momentum is E/c, and direction determined by their angles.

Photons carry momentum in the direction of their propagation. Since one photon is going upper-right and the other lower-right, their directions are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, relative to the x-axis.

Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so positive x and negative y components.

The total momentum after the collision must equal the total initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c in the +x direction.

The total energy after the collision is the sum of the energies of the two photons. Each photon has energy E, so total energy is 2E.

But wait, the initial total energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. The electron's energy is gamma_e m c² =4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron's energy is gamma_p m c² =2 * 0.511 MeV =1.022 MeV. So initial total energy E_initial =2.044 +1.022 =3.066 MeV.

So the photons' total energy is 2E =3.066 MeV → E= 3.066 /2 =1.533 MeV.

So each photon has energy 1.533 MeV.

Now, let's denote the angles of the two photons with respect to the x-axis as theta and (360 - theta), but given both are on the right side (upper and lower), probably theta and ( - theta), but considering the direction.

Wait, but the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles are theta and (360 - theta) if we're considering standard angles, but probably, for simplicity, let's think in terms of angles above and below the x-axis. So theta for upper, and theta below for the lower? Wait no, the angles could be symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, but the problem says the two photons have the same energy and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps their angles are theta and -theta, assuming they are symmetric about the x-axis.

But wait, the problem doesn't state that, but given that their energies are same, perhaps that's the case. Because if they have same energy, and their angles are symmetric, their y-components would cancel out, but the x-components add up. But let's proceed.

So, each photon has energy E =1.533 MeV.

Momentum of each photon is E/c. Since E=pc for photons, each photon's momentum is E/c = (1.533e6 eV)/(3e8 m/s) → but perhaps we don't need the actual value because it will cancel out.

Let me denote the angles of the photons as theta and phi. But wait, since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their angles would be theta and (theta + 180) but in the right direction. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric above and below the x-axis, making their angles theta and -theta.

Wait, but to have their total momentum in the x-direction be the same as initial, which is positive. So the sum of their momenta in the x direction must be 2.1408 m_e c.

Each photon's x momentum component is (E/c) * cos(theta_i), where theta_i is the angle for photon i.

Similarly, the y components are (E/c) sin(theta_i). Since the two photons are in upper-right and lower-right, their y components would be positive and negative respectively. But since their energies are same, the total y-momentum should be zero if they are symmetric. But wait, the initial system's y momentum is zero because both particles were moving along the x-axis. So the total y momentum after collision must also be zero.

Ah, right! Because the initial total momentum is all along x; the y-component is zero. Therefore, the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.

So, if photon 1 has a y-component p1y = (E/c) sin(theta), and photon 2 has p2y = (E/c) sin(phi), then p1y + p2y =0.

But wait, if one is upper-right and the other lower-right, then their y components are opposite in sign. So, suppose photon 1 has angle theta above x-axis, photon 2 has angle phi below x-axis. Then, p1y = (E/c) sin(theta), p2y = (E/c) sin(-phi) = - (E/c) sin(phi). So for their sum to be zero, (E/c)(sin(theta) - sin(phi)) )= 0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi). Which implies that theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi, but given their directions are upper and lower right, phi would be negative theta if symmetric. 

So perhaps theta = -phi, meaning their y-components are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. So for each photon, their angles are theta and -theta. That would make the sum zero.

So let's proceed under that assumption.

Now, the sum of the x components must be equal to the initial momentum in x. So:

p1x + p2x = 2.1408 m_e c.

Each photon's x component is (E/c) cos(theta) and (E/c) cos(-theta) = (E/c) cos(theta), since cos is even. So:

(E/c)(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) )=2.1408 m_e c.

Wait, no, because photon 2's angle is -theta. So cos(-theta)=cos(theta), so p2x = (E/c) cos(theta).

So the sum is 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.

We can solve for cos(theta).

E is 1.533 MeV, but for units, perhaps we should express everything in terms of m_e c squared.

Wait, since E_photon =1.533 MeV, and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So E =3 * m_e c².

Wait, 1.533 MeV is 3 * 0.511 MeV, because 3 * 0.511 is 1.533.

So E =3 m_e c².

So E/c =3 m_e c² /c =3 m_e c.

So, the momentum of each photon is p = E/c =3 m_e c.

So, substituting into the x-component equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(theta) =2.1408 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

2 *3 cos(theta) =2.1408 → 6 cos(theta)=2.1408 → cos(theta)=2.1408 /6 ≈0.3568.

So theta = arccos(0.3568) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that. Arccos(0.3568) is about 69 degrees because cos(60)=0.5, cos(90)=0, so 0.3568 is between 60 and 90, closer to 70. Let me compute it accurately.

cos(69°)= approx 0.3584. Oh, wait, 0.3568 is just a bit less than that, so theta is about 69.1 degrees or so. Hmm, perhaps around 69.3 degrees.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator: 0.3568...

Take the inverse cosine. Let me think: 

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584.

But 0.3568 is just a bit less. So perhaps 69.3 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately: 

Let me compute using a calculator.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more precisely:

theta = arccos(2.1408/(6)) → 2.1408 divided by 6 is 0.3568.

So, to find theta where cos(theta)=0.3568.

Well, using a calculator: arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69.0 degrees.

So each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees with the x-axis, one above and the other below.

Wait, but the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So each photon is at theta and -theta.

So the two photons' angles with the x-axis are +69 degrees and -69 degrees.

Wait, but the question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons. So the angle between them is 69 - (-69) =138 degrees.

Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, the angle between two vectors is the smaller angle between them. So if one is at +69 and the other at -69, the angle between them is 138 degrees, which is the sum. But wait, 69 +69 is 138, yes.

So the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me go through the steps again.

1. Compute the initial momentum.

Electron: gamma_e =4, beta_e =sqrt(1 -1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

p_e =gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c =4 m_e c (0.9682) =3.8728 m_e c (positive x).

Positron: gamma_p =2, beta_p =sqrt(1 -1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

p_p= gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c =2 m_e c (0.8660)=1.732 m_e c (negative x).

Total p_initial =3.8728 -1.732 =2.1408 m_e c in +x.

2. Energy:

E_initial = sum of electron and positron's energies.

Electron:4 *0.511 =2.044 MeV.

Positron:2 *0.511=1.022 MeV.

Total E_initial= 3.066 MeV.

So each photon has E=3.066 /2=1.533 MeV.

3. Photon momentum: E/c =1.533 MeV/c.

But since m_e c^2=0.511 MeV, 1.533 =3 *0.511→3 m_e c². So E/c=3 m_e c.

4. Momentum in x direction: sum must equal 2.1408 m_e c.

Each photon's x component is (E/c) cos(theta) =3 m_e c cos(theta).

So for two photons, the sum is 2*(3 m_e c cos(theta)) )=6 m_e c cos(theta).

Set equal to 2.1408 m_e c:

6 cos(theta) =2.1408 → cos(theta)=2.1408/6≈0.3568.

Theta= arccos(0.3568)≈69 degrees.

So the photons are at +/-69 degrees from x-axis. So the angle between them is 138 degrees.

So the answer is option C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the two photons.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron moves with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$, and its momentum is $p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \beta_e$, where $\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_e^2} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682$. Thus, $p_e \approx 3.8728 m_e c$ (positive $x$-direction).
   - The positron moves with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$, and its momentum is $p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \beta_p$, where $\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma_p^2} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$. Since the positron moves to the left, $p_p = -1.732 m_e c$ (negative $x$-direction).
   - Total initial momentum:  
     $$p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = 3.8728 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.1408 m_e c \, (\text{positive } x\text{-direction}).$$

2. **Initial Energy**:
   - The electron's energy is $E_e = \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 \cdot 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 2.044 \, \text{MeV}$.
   - The positron's energy is $E_p = \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 \cdot 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$.
   - Total initial energy:  
     $$E_{\text{initial}} = E_e + E_p = 2.044 \, \text{MeV} + 1.022 \, \text{MeV} = 3.066 \, \text{MeV}.$$

3. **Photon Energies**:
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies:  
     $$E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = \frac{3.066 \, \text{MeV}}{2} = 1.533 \, \text{MeV}.$$

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - For photons, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$, so the momentum of each photon is:  
     $$p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{1.533 \, \text{MeV}}{c} = 3 m_e c.$$

5. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before the collision, which is $2.1408 m_e c$ in the $x$-direction.
   - Let the angles of the photons with respect to the $x$-axis be $\theta$ (upper-right) and $-\theta$ (lower-right). The $x$-components of their momenta are $p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta$ and $p_{\text{photon}} \cos(-\theta)$, respectively. Since $\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta$, the total $x$-momentum is:  
     $$p_{\text{total}} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta + p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta.$$
   - Equating to the initial momentum:  
     $$2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = 2.1408 m_e c.$$
     Substituting $p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c$:  
     $$2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = 2.1408 m_e c \implies 6 \cos\theta = 2.1408 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.1408}{6} \approx 0.3568.$$
     $$\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.$$

6. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The two photons are symmetrically placed at $\pm 69^\circ$ relative to the $x$-axis. The angle between them is:  
     $$\Delta\theta = 69^\circ - (-69^\circ) = 138^\circ.$$

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the two photons is **138 degrees**.
