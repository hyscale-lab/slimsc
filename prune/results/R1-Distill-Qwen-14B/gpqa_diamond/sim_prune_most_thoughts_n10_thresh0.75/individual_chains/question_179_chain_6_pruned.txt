Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what each part is about.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. I need to evaluate statements about them and choose the correct option.

First, let me recall some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is unitary. Also, the exponential of a matrix often comes into play for unitary operators, especially when dealing with time evolution (like the time evolution operator U = e^(-iHt/ħ) where H is Hermitian).

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. For the norm to change, the operator e^X must not be unitary. Because if an operator is unitary, applying it preserves the norm, i.e., ||Uv|| = ||v|| for any vector v. So if e^X is not unitary, multiplying by it could change the norm.

Wait, but what determines whether e^X is unitary? Well, X must be anti-Hermitian because the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Let me check if X is anti-Hermitian. A matrix A is anti-Hermitian if A† = -A, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

Let me compute X†. X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† should be the conjugate transpose of X. Let's compute that.

The conjugate of X's elements:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose, so columns become rows.

So X† is:
Row 1: (-i, -1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (-2i, -1, i)

Wait, let me write X again. X is:

[ i   -1   2i
  1    0    1
 2i  -1  -i ]

So X† is:

[ i*   1*   (2i)*
 (-1)* 0*  (-1)*
 (2i)* 1*  (-i)* ]

Wait, no, the conjugate transpose is the transpose of the conjugate. So each element becomes its complex conjugate, then transposed.

Wait, more accurately: X† is the conjugate of X's rows, then transposed.

So X's first row is [i, -1, 2i]. Conjugate: [-i, -1, -2i].

Second row: [1,0,1] → [1,0,1] (conjugate same, since real).

Third row: [2i, -1, -i] → [-2i, -1, i].

Then transpose these to get columns as rows.

So X† would be:

First column of X becoming first row after conjugation:

First row of X†: first column of X's conjugate.
Original X columns:
Column 1: i, 1, 2i → conjugate: -i, 1, -2i → becomes first row of X†: (-i, 1, -2i).

Wait no, let me think again. The conjugate transpose is done by taking each element (i,j), then its conjugate is placed at (j,i). So to compute X†, I take each element and first conjugate it, then transpose.

Alternatively, another approach: X
