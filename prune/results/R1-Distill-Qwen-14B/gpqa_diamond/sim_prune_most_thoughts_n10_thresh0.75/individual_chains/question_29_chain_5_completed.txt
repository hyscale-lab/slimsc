Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a mutant barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The compound is due to a gene with five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations, typically altering single nucleotides.

The intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants are provided. We need to look for which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure. Because the anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene, if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound shouldn't be produced.

Let me look at each mutant and the changes in their sequences.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact, the first part is different. Let me look at each position. The fifth and sixth nucleotides: Intact is TT, Mutant 1 is CT. Wait, the initial part is ATGTTT... in the intact. So let's index each position.

Wait, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA..., and the mutant 1 starts with ATGTTCTACG... So let's compare each position.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-7: ATGTTTC (assuming each group is 3 nucleotides)
Mutant1: positions 1-7: ATGTTCT

Wait, so the 6th and 7th positions: Intact has TT, Mutant1 has CT. So position 4: in the intact, what's the 4th position? Let me count:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T

Wait, maybe I should line them up. Let me write the first part of the Intact gene and Mutant 1.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TTA GTC GT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TTA GTC GC...

So the first few codons:

Intact: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Mutant1: ATG, TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Wait, so the first change is in the second codon. Intact is TTT (Phe), Mutant1 is TTC (also Phe)—same amino acid. The next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Oh, so the third codon is different. So in the intact, it's CTC, and in Mutant1, it's TAC. That changes from Leu to Tyr.

Hmm, that's a change in the amino acid. So that's a missense mutation. Does that produce a nonfunctional protein? Maybe, but not necessarily. It depends on whether that residue is critical.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So looking at the same region:

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG...

Mutant2: CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG...

Wait, wait, the Mutant2 sequence after TTC is AGC TGG TAC.

Wait, the first part of Mutant2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, let's break it down.

Intact has ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAAG C TGG TAC T...

Wait, the first few codons:

Intact: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGG (Trp)

Mutant2: ATG, TTC (Phe same), TAA (stop codon?), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGG (Trp).

Wait, no, let me check the exact sequence. The intact gene at the start is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the sequence:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG...
Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG...

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant2 it's TAA. TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). Oh! So if the third codon becomes TAA, that's a stop, meaning the protein is truncated early. So the protein would be shorter, potentially nonfunctional. That could disrupt the anti-nutritional compound synthesis.

Wait, but in the initial part, the first change is at position:

In intact: ...TTTCTCGCT...
Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCT...

So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So that would cause a much shorter protein. That could disrupt the function.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at this, the first part is ATGTTTTACGC...

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant3: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...

So, looking at the first few codons:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in Mutant3 it's TTA (Leu) perhaps? Wait, no, let me see:

Wait, the first part is ATGTTTTA... in Mutant3.

Wait the intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...

So, the second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), third is CTC (Leu), fourth GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly), etc.

In Mutant3, the second codon is still TTT (Phe), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly), sixth GTC (Val). Wait, but in intact, the sixth codon is ACT (Thr), but in Mutant3, it's GTC (Val). So that's an amino acid change from Thr to Val. Not a stop, so the protein is altered but perhaps not nonfunctional.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the start:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the sequence after ATGTTTTACGCTA...

So, the second codon is TTT (same as intact), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth CTA (Leu), fifth CTT (Leu), etc.

Wait, let me break it down.

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: ...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in the first few codons, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). The fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in Mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So the amino acids are changing, but without a stop codon.

Now, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene product is not made, or if it's nonfunctional.

Which of these mutations would cause a nonfunctional gene product?

Looking at each:

Mutant1: Changes from Leu to Tyr, and another change later—maybe. Let me check the rest.

Mutant1's sequence:

After TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG...

Wait, the first difference is the third codon (TAC, Tyr). No stop, so the protein continues.

Mutant2: Third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein is truncated early, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional product.

Mutant3: Changes in the third codon (TAC, Tyr) and the sixth (GTC, Val instead of ACT, Thr). The rest doesn't have a stop. So the protein is longer, but with some changes. Whether these changes disrupt function depends.

Mutant4: Changes in third codon (TAC) and fourth (ACT). No stop. So again, the protein is altered but not necessarily nonfunctional.

So, the most likely way to eliminate the compound is if the gene is nonfunctional. A stop codon early on would likely do that.

So looking at Mutant2: the third codon is TAA, a stop. So the gene would produce a truncated protein, which is probably nonfunctional. So this mutation would likely disrupt the gene, leading to no compound.

But wait, I need to check if the mutation is in a coding sequence (exon) or intron. The question says the mutations are in the target gene, which is the gene with exons and introns. The changes are in the first exon area. So in exons, the coding regions.

So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA (stop). So the mRNA would have a stop codon there. Therefore, the protein would be shorter.

Alternatively, if the mutation is in a critical part of the gene, like the start codon or an important region, but in this case, the start codon (ATG) is intact.

So among the options, which mutation causes a stop codon?

Mutant2 has a stop codon in the third codon, which would result in a shorter protein.

But wait, let me check the exact sequences again.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the first few nucleotides of the intact are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2 is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So the first codon is same (ATG), second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in Mutant2 it's TTC (Phe, same amino acid), third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in Mutant2 it's TAA (stop).

So the first three codons in intact: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...

In Mutant2: Met-Phe-Stop...

Wait, no. Let me count:

Intact:
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant2:
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTC (Phe)
3: TAA (stop)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
...

Wait, so the third codon in Mutant 2 is TAA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be translated up to that point, producing a truncated protein. So the resulting protein would be much shorter than normal.

If the gene's product is the enzyme that makes the anti-nutritional compound, then a truncated enzyme might not function. Hence, the compound wouldn't be made.

Therefore, Mutant2 is the most likely to eliminate the compound.

Looking at the options, option A is Mutant2.


To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the provided sequences of the intact gene and the four mutants. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, potentially by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - The gene starts with the start codon `ATG`, followed by a series of codons encoding amino acids.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison to the intact gene shows changes in the third codon (`CTC` in intact → `TAC` in mutant), altering Leu to Tyr. This is a missense mutation, but it does not introduce a stop codon. The protein is likely still functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Comparison reveals a critical change in the third codon (`CTC` in intact → `TAA` in mutant). `TAA` is a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. This likely renders the protein nonfunctional, effectively eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes occur in the third codon (`CTC` → `TAC`, Leu → Tyr) and the sixth codon (`ACT` → `GTC`, Thr → Val). These are missense mutations, but the protein remains intact and likely functional.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes include `CTC` → `TAC` (Leu → Tyr) in the third codon and `GCT` → `ACT` (Ala → Thr) in the fourth codon. These are missense mutations, and the protein remains largely functional.

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This disruption prevents the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
