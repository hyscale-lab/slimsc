Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude is important. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the given data are phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The energy is 50 MeV electrons. 

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves the phase shifts. Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδₗ} sinδₗ ] 

But wait, this is for each partial wave l. And I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f, is related to the optical theorem or something like that. Oh right, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. 

The forward direction is when the scattering angle θ is zero, which is along the incident beam. So we're interested in f(0). 

The formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is given by:

Im f(0) = (1/(k)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) sin δₗ ]

Where k is the wave number of the electrons. 

So I need to calculate this sum for l=0 to 4, since we have δ₀ to δ₄. 

First, let's compute each term (2l+1) * sin δₗ for each l.

Wait, but what's the value of k? The wave number k is given by k = √(2mE)/ħ, but I think using natural units might simplify things. Or perhaps there's a standard formula involving the energy.

Wait, the energy is given as 50 MeV. But wait, the units are in MeV, so I should probably use the appropriate constants. Let me think about the units for k. Since the scattering amplitude is in units of fm (femtometers), which is 10^-15 meters. 

So, the wave number k can be calculated using the relativistic expression. For electrons, the mass m is about 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy E is 50 MeV. 

The formula for k is:

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħc 

Wait, actually, the expression for k is derived from the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy is E = gamma m c², and the momentum p = gamma m v. But for electrons, when E >> m c² (since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV), we can approximate p ≈ E / c. So the non-relativistic formula might not hold, but perhaps for this problem, we'll proceed with the non-relativistic approach, unless told otherwise.

Wait, but in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k is sqrt(2mE). But since the units here involve MeV and femtometers, perhaps we need to compute it properly.

Let me recall the formula for the wave number k when the energy is given in MeV. 

The relation is k = sqrt(2mE) / ħc 

But E and m need to be in the same energy units. Let me compute E in joules, but that might be cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So for E =50 MeV, and m the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². Let's compute k:

k = sqrt(2 * m * E) / (ħ c )

Wait, but m is in MeV/c², E in MeV. So
