Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. But the question is, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm, right. So the key here is to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change when it transits the star.

Wait, wait. First, I should probably figure out what the actual brightness variation is due to the spots. Then, compare that to the variation caused by a planet transit.

So, the star's brightness variation comes from the spots being cooler. When a spot comes into view, it makes the star appear slightly dimmer because that area is emitting less light.

But how does the filling factor and the temperature difference play into this?

Let me think. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the star's one hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the star. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) times 0.5 (hemisphere) of the star's surface. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. The filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that is covered. So when the star rotates, depending on the viewing angle, we might see a varying amount of the hemisphere with spots. Hmm, but the problem mentions that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a whole. Wait, but the rotation could cause spots to appear on the limb, but perhaps they are only on one side. Wait, maybe the setup is that the spots are on the front hemisphere, so as the star rotates, parts of them come into view from our
