Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that down. So the state |ψ> is this vector.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. To do that, I have to multiply the state vector by the P_z matrix, then take the inner product with the state again. Alternatively, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state |ψ> can be expressed in terms of P_z's eigenstates, and the expectation value would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, looking at P_z matrix: it's diagonal, right? The matrix is:

[ ħ, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So the basis states are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the first basis vector is |+z> with eigenvalue ħ, the second is |0z> with eigenvalue 0, and the third is |-z> with eigenvalue -ħ.

So the state |ψ> is given in terms of these basis vectors. Let's see the components: the first component is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2.

Wait, but the state is a column vector [ a, b, c ]^T. So in terms of the basis, |ψ> = a|+z> + b|0z> + c|−z>.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Because expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So each component is |coefficient|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue.
