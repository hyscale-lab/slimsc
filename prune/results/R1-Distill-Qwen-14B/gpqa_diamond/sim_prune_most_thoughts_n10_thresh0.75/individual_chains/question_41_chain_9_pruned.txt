Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

Wait, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. So normally, the speed would be 1/n since c is 1 here.

But wait, the glass itself is moving. So this is probably a case where we need to consider the relative motion between the medium and the observer. I think this relates to the concept of how velocities add in relativity, but wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or does it matter?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. If the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab frame?

In classical mechanics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving at speed v_light in the same direction (because the beam is moving toward the observer as the glass does), would the observed speed be v_light + v?

But wait, no. Because from the lab frame, the light's speed in the medium is already 1/n. But the medium itself is moving, so maybe we have to adjust for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it
