Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each reaction and see what's happening.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, the structure has a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's CH2OH). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an allyl group attached at the middle carbon. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the cyclohexanone ring.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think this is an alkylation reaction. Where would the deprotonation occur?

The molecule has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The OH is acidic, so sodium hydride would deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group, turning it into an O- which is a good nucleophile. Then, benzyl bromide would react, delivering a benzyl group. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, replacing the bromide. So the product would have a benzyl ether group instead of the OH. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH. Deprotonating gives -CH2O-. Then, when benzyl bromide (which is C6H5CH2Br) attacks, the O- would take the benzyl group, making it -CH2-O-benzyl. So product 1 would have a benzyl ether at the 3 position. So the structure becomes 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Or maybe the substituent order is different, but the key point is that the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the alkylation is at the carbonyl group. But no, the cyclohexanone is a ketone. Sodium hydride can deprotonate the alpha position, but in this case, the carbonyl is at position 1 (cyclohexan-1-one), so the alpha positions are 2 and 6. Wait, the starting structure is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1. The hydroxymethyl is at 3, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So position 3 is alpha to the carbonyl. So sodium hydride could deprotonate there. But wait, the hydroxymethyl's OH has pKa around 16-18, which is more acidic than alpha hydrogens (pKa ~20). So it's easier to deprotonate the -OH group than the alpha hydrogen.

So, product 1 would have the hydroxymethyl converted to a benzyl ether. So the substituent at position 3 is now -CH2-O-Bn (benzyl). The other substituent is the prop-1-en-2-yl at position 5.

Moving on to product 2: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl. Oh, that sounds like the Wolff-Kishner reaction. Wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner is for removing ketones by converting them into amines via hydrazones and then eliminating them under strong base and heat. But here, the reagent is p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. Wait, wait, the standard procedure is that hydrazine reacts with ketones to form hydrazones. But when they are treated with something like H2SO4 and heat, they eliminate to form N-substituted compounds. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of HCl, it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's the formation of a hydrazone. So the ketone would react with the hydrazide. Wait, but p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a specific reagent. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a way to form a hydrazone, which is then used in another reaction. Let me think about the steps. So, product 1 is a ketone with a benzyl ether and an allyl group. Then, adding p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and HCl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is the formation of a hydrazone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Staudinger reaction, but no, that's with triphenylphosphine and azides.

Alternatively, considering the mechanism: p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNH-NH2) would react with the ketone. The ketone (cyclohexanone) would form a hydrazone with this reagent. But in the presence of HCl, perhaps it's protonating something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another approach: The hydrazide (Ts-NH-NH2) reacts with the ketone to form a hydrazone. So the ketone group (C=O) becomes C=N-NH-Ts. So the product 2 would have a hydrazone group at position 1, and the rest remains the same (benzyl ether at 3, allyl at 5).

Then, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride. Hmm, n-BuLi is a strong base and a good nucleophile. What could happen here?

In the presence of a hydrazone, which is a good leaving group in some cases. Wait, but hydrazones are usually good for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone is deprotonated, and then n-BuLi adds to the adjacent position.

Wait, in hydrazones, the carbon is adjacent to two NH groups. Maybe the Li would attack the carbon, leading to some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone is converted into an enamine or something else.

Wait, another thought: When a
