Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The problem begins with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others. So, the 6H as a tripletâ€”maybe that's from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, no, because 6H suggests three CH2 groups, maybe? Or maybe it's a group where each H is next to two others. For example, perhaps a (CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure yet.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of those protons is next to three others. So, maybe a CH group next to a CH2? Or perhaps it's a situation with two neighboring Hs. Wait, quartet could come from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 as well. Let me think: A quartet would have n+1 peaks, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So, if a proton is next to three others, that's a quartet. So, perhaps a CH2 next to a CH3? Because CH3 has three Hs. So, maybe the quartet is a CH2 group next to a CH3.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Let me think: diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. Its NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 groups,
