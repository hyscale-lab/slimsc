Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the mouse model. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They're having trouble getting the protein to overexpress, so they're trying to figure out why.

The given DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct. Let me look at that. I remember that the reading frame is important; the start codon is at the beginning, and the rest should be in frame.

Looking at the sequence, the start is ATG, which is methionine, the standard start codon. Then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA tag should come right after the start codon.

Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence would be something like the HA epitope, which is YPYDVPDYA or similar. But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine (Tyr), then CCATACG ATG... Hmm, maybe the HA sequence is introduced as a small addition.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should start with ATG followed by the HA coding sequence. Let me think about the sequence.

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT C... So the first few codons are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, etc. Wait, that doesn't seem like the HA tag. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is usually YPYDVPDYA. Let me see the DNA for that.

The HA epitope's DNA is typically TAC TAC CCC ATG TAC ATC TAC GGC ATC... Wait, maybe the HA tag is being added here. Let me think: the HA tag's start is TAC (Y), then another TAC (Y), then CCA (Pro), so the first few codons would be TAC TAC CCA.

Looking at the given sequence, after ATG, the next three codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr). Oh wait, so the HA tag would be TAC (Y) as the start. But the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so maybe the sequence is correct. Let me see: the first part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT C...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write it out in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA
