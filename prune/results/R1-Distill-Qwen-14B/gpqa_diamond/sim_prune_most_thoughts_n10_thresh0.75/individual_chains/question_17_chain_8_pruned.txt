Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The problem states that the solution has a concentration of 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I'm assuming that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I remember that K here probably refers to the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. So a high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, right?

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So, when the complex is formed, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, assuming that the complex is the only species present initially. But in reality, some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but how much? Since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free calcium ions should be very low. Because the K is big, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the [Ca²+] would be small.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let's think about the dissociation. Let me model this. Let me denote the complex as C = CaEDTA^2-.

So the initial concentrations are: [C] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. As it dissociates, let's say x moles of C dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- per liter. So at equilibrium, [C] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0
