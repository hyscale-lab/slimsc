Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh wait, that's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is involved, which makes sense for a harmonic oscillator.

The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along each axis. Wait, but actually, in spherical coordinates, it's a bit different. Or maybe not? Because in 3D, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but for the isotropic case, it's more convenient to use the radial quantum number and the angular momentum part.

Wait a second, for a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the principal quantum numbers in each direction, but since it's isotropic, it's often described using the radial quantum number and the angular momentum quantum number.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the 3D oscillator. The energy levels in 3D harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is
