Okay, so I have this question about quasars and their observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, the question says that there's a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, but I'm not exactly sure how that relates to the comoving distance. Wait, I think it's about something called the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe something related to redshift.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—could that be the rest wavelength of a specific emission line? I recall that the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. But if it's observed at 790 nm, that would mean a redshift. Because when a source is moving away, the wavelength stretches. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted, so redshifted.

So the formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 is roughly, let me calculate. 121 times 6 is 726, which is less than 790. 121*6.5 is 786.5, which is close. So 790/121 ≈ 6.52. So z ≈ 5.52.

But wait, quasars often have broad emission lines, and the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent one. If that line is observed at 790 nm, then yes, that's a redshift of about 5.5. So the quasar is at a high redshift.

Now the question is about the comoving distance. The options are A to D, all around 6-9 gigaparsecs. The universe is flat, with Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7.

I remember that the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=1/(1+z) to a=1. Wait, but a=1 is now, so we're looking back to a when a was 1/(1+z). So for z=5.5, a=1/(6.5) ≈ 0.1538.

The comoving distance is given by D_c = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z (1 / E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Wait, but wait, the exact expression is a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think I can use some approximation or tables for the comoving distance given these parameters.

I remember that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance for high redshifts (like z=5) is around several gigaparsecs. But exact value depends on the integral.

Alternatively, I think using an online calculator or approximate formula would help, but since I can't do that right now, I need to recall some standard values. I think for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5 is roughly around 10 Gpc, but wait, that doesn't match the options given. Wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the proper distance and the comoving distance. Oh, no, the comoving distance is what we're being asked about. So perhaps I should calculate it.

The formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z (1 / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)) dz'.

But integrating this from 0 to z=5.5 is a bit involved. Alternatively, I could approximate using lookback time tables or use the approximation for certain redshifts.

Another approach: using the age of the universe and lookback time.

Wait, the Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70/(3.086e19) m/s per mpc. But maybe I don't need to compute it directly.

Alternatively, I can recall that for Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the luminosity distance at z=5.5 would be higher than the comoving distance. But perhaps the comoving distance is what we're after.

Wait, perhaps a simpler way: using the approximation for comoving distance for a flat universe. I remember that the comoving distance can be approximated as (c / H0) * f(z), where f(z) is an integral function.

Alternatively, I think that for high redshifts, the comoving distance scales with the integral ∫0^z dz' / E(z'). For Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

But without precise integration, maybe I can use some standard values. I know that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.3 billion light-years, which is about 400 Mpc, but that's for a different cosmology.

Wait, perhaps I can remember that for the current cosmology (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7), the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 10 Gpc. But wait, the options don't have 10, but 7-9. Hmm, maybe my memory is off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the co-moving distance in terms of the Hubble length. The Hubble length is c/H0. H0
