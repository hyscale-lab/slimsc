Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the Pauli exclusion principle and particle emissions. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I think I remember that the total isospin T, spin S, and orbital angular momentum L of the system must satisfy this condition.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are A to D, each involving a different transition and a particle (p, f, s, etc.).

Wait, let me clarify the setup. The initial state is 1S0. So that's (2S+1)L(J) notation. For 1S0, S is 0 since (2*0 +1) =1, so S=0. L is 0 because it's S state. So J is 0, right? So the initial state has T = 0? Or does T refer to the isospin of the NN system? Hmm, I think T is the isospin of the two-nucleon system. So initially, it's in a state with isospin T. After emitting a particle, the final NN state has T =0.

But the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which I think is the ground state of two nucleons, like a deuteron. The deuteron has spin 1 (since it's S=1 for two spin-1/2 particles) but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 1S0 would imply S=0? Because the notation is (2S+1)L, so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Wait, but no, for two nucleons, each with spin 1/2, the possible total spins are S=0 and S=1. So 1S0 would have S=0.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up between the spectroscopic notation and the quantum numbers. Let me think: the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L is 0 because it's S, so L=0. Then J is 0 because J = L + S, so 0 + 0 =0.

So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0. Now, the NN system emits a particle X. So the final state is the NN system plus the emitted X. But the question is about the NN state after emission. Wait, no, the question says, "the final NN state has T(NN) =0." So the NN system after emission has T=0.

The Pauli condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.
