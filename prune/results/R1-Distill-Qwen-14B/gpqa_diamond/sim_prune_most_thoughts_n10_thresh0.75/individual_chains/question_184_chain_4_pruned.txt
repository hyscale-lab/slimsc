Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the numbering: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, actually, in benzene, the numbering could be such that the substituents are adjacent or in a different arrangement. But according to the IUPAC name, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, maybe the numbering isn't 1, 2, 3 as in consecutive. Let me think about the substituents again.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That means the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So in the ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So they are meta to each other? Wait, no. Wait, positions 1, 2, and 3 in a benzene ring are adjacent? Or are they 1, 2, 3 in a way that they aren't all meta.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, meaning each substituent is next to each other. But I'm not sure
