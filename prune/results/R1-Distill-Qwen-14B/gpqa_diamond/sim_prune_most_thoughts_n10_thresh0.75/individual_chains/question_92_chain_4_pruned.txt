Okay, so I've got this enthalpy of formation problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think I should count how many of each type of bond are in this molecule to calculate the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, wait. The question gives bond energies, right? So the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies. But wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. The enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So to calculate it, we usually consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

But from the given data, I think we're supposed to use the bond energies to compute the enthalpy of formation. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but that seems different. Oh wait, the question says "enthalpy of formation," so I'll stick with that.

Wait, the data given: Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, that's the energy required to break a C-C bond in graphite or something? Or is it the energy to break a C atom into gaseous atoms? Because enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break bonds to form isolated atoms. So for carbon, that would be the energy to break all the bonds in the elemental form, which for graphite is each C atom bonded to three others. Wait, but enthalpy of atomization per mole of C atoms. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe the enthalpy of atomization given is for a carbon-carbon bond. Oh, wait, the question says, "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." Hmm, maybe that's the energy to break a C-C bond in graphite into two gaseous C atoms. So each C-C bond requires 1000 kJ/mol to break. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the energy to break a C-C bond in a molecule into two C atoms, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of atomization (sometimes called bond dissociation
