Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B. I'll tackle each one separately, starting with Reaction A.

Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) → Product A.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester, it's likely an example of a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. Wait, no, Michael addition is typically between a nucleophile and an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Oh wait, the acrylate is the Michael donor here. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone. So maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol addition? Or perhaps it's a crossed aldol reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Michael addition since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, t-BuOK is a strong base. So perhaps it deprotonates the acrylate to form an enolate, which then attacks the ketone. Or maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate of the acrylate attacks the ketone.

Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. Wait, wait—no, wait: 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl cyclohexanone. So the ring is cyclohexanone (position 1 is the ketone), position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group. Position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure is a bit crowded. So positions 2 and 6 are both substituted.

So when ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt) reacts with this ketone in presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, what happens? I think it's a case of the enolate
