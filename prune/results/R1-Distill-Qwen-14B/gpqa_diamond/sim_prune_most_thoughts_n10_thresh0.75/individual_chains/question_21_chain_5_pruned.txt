Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. But wait, the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm.

The problem has two parts: part A and part B. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, part A: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, changing the structure. For example, in carbonyl compounds, enols and keto forms are common tautomers. So, which of these two compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinoneâ€”I think that's a quinone with a benzene ring. Quinones are diketones, right? So, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, but if there are two ketones, can they tautomerize? I'm a bit confused here. Tautomerism usually occurs when there's an acidic hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl. For example, in a diketone, if the alpha hydrogens are present, they could tautomerize. Or wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone is like O=C6H4=O, right? The structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (like para). So the carbonyl groups are attached directly to the benzene. Then, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. So, no alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl is attached to the ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on the adjacent carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone can't tautomerize because there are no hydrogens to shift. So it doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. The structure would have each carbonyl group attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, no: 1,3,5-trione means each ketone is separated by two carbons. So, each ketone is at every other position. So the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So each ketone is at positions 1, 3, 5. So, the carbons adjacent to the ketones would have two CH2 groups? Hmm, no. Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to two other ketones. So each carbon that is a carbonyl is attached to two other carbonyl groups. Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only form bonds up to four. Wait, no, the structure is such that the ring has three carbonyl groups. So each of those carbons would have two double bonds to oxygen, and be connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring. Wait, but that would require each of those carbons to have two single bonds to the ring and double bonds
