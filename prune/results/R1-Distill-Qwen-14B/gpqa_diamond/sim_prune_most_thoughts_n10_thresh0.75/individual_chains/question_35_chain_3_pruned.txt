Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. So the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c times S, so substituting c = h/(4π), Ay should be (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write that out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options given are A, B, C, D, each making a statement about the eigenvalues or eigenvectors. 

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let's represent Ay in terms of its matrix elements.

So, Ay is:

[ (0)*(h/(4π)), (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ (i)*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Let me denote λ as the eigenvalue, so the equation is:

| Ay - λI | = 0

Which gives the determinant:

( -λ ) * ( -λ ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) = 0

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The matrix (Ay - λI) is:

[ -λ, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Wait, no. The determinant is (a11 * a22) - (a12 * a21). So,

( -λ ) * ( -λ ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) 

Calculating each part:

First term: λ²

Second term: (-i) * i = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So, the product is (h^2/(16 π²)) * 1.

So determinant equation becomes:

λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4 π) because sqrt(16) is 4. So λ can be ± h/(4 π) * (1/2)? No, let me compute that again.

Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4 π) ?

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the determinant step. Because the matrix S has elements [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and when multiplied by c = h/(4π), Ay becomes [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

So the matrix is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

The characteristic equation is:

(0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i c)(i c) = 0

Which is λ² - [ (-i c)(i c) ] = 0.

Compute (-i c)(i c): Multiply the terms. (-i)(i) = -i² = -( -1) = 1. So c^2 * 1. So the equation is λ² - c² = 0.

So λ^2 = c^2 → λ = ± c.

Since c is h/(4 π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them directly present this. Wait, the options are about the eigenvalues and their parts. Let's check.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2π h, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because eigenvalues I found are real? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix with real diagonal elements? No, no, the diagonal is zero. Wait, the matrix Ay is:

[0, -i c]
[i c, 0]

Which is a 2x2 matrix with real elements? No, the elements are complex. Wait, no, the elements are complex, but their positions might lead to a traceless matrix, and perhaps the eigenvalues are purely imaginary? No, wait, because the characteristic equation is λ² = c², which would give real eigenvalues, but wait, let's double-check.

Wait, the matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalues correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation earlier.

Wait, the matrix is 2x2:

[[ -λ, -i c ],
 [i c, -λ ] ]

So the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) → λ² - [ (i c)(-i c) ] → because (-i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i²) c² = (1) c². Wait, no: (-i c)*(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - (1 * c^2) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c.

Wait, but c is h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). These are real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero. So the eigenvalues are real, either +h/(4π) or -h/(4π). So when looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: The imaginary part is ±2π h, and real part ±h/(4π). But that can't be because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But the eigenvalues are in terms of h and π, so this seems unrelated. Probably not correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Hmm. Well, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of the Y-component (Ay) are also eigenfunctions of A² because A² is the square of the total angular momentum and commutes with each component. However, they don't necessarily commute with other components like Az. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C seems correct.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about this. If a
