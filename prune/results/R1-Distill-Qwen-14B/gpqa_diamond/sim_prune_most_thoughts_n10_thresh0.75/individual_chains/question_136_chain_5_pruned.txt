Okay, so I have this problem about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, let me read it again. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So its magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence relates to sources or sinks in a field. Also, there's Gauss's Law which connects the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume to the flux through the surface. Oh right, Gauss's Law says that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the flux of E through the surface of that volume.

So in this case, I'm looking for ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV. Using Gauss's Law, this would be equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere (the sphere of radius R). But wait, what's the divergence of f in this case?

Let me think about how to compute the divergence of a radial vector field. The general formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r) + ... (but since the field has only radial component, the other terms are zero). So ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

Given f(r) = 1/r², which is f_r. So substituting in, ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let's compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero? Wait, that can't be right. Because I remember that the divergence of a radial field 1/r² is actually - something. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me do it step by step. f_r = 1/r². So, r² f_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. Now, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. So the
