Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let's think about what each part could mean.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests something strong, maybe something like a strong base reacting with an acid, but more violently? Or maybe a reaction involving something like a metal and an acid producing hydrogen gas. Wait, but the gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. If W's molecule has same protons and neutrons, that's probably H2O or something else? Wait, no, H2O's molecule has 2 H and 1 O. But wait, wait, W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. Let me think: the only gas that comes to mind is H2, but that's just hydrogen. Or maybe another diatomic gas. Alternatively, perhaps CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 neutrons in total (wait, no, each C is 12, O is 16, but wait the molecule as a whole? Or per atom? Hmm, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So, for each molecule, sum of protons in all atoms equals sum of neutrons in all atoms.

Wait, let me think. So each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (in the common isotope). So H2O: 2 H (2 protons, 0 neutrons) + 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons) = 10 protons, 8 neutrons. So 10 !=8. So that doesn't fit. Another gas
