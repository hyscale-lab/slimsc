Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about how the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

So the star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but does the spot affect the overall luminosity? Oh, I remember that when spots are present, the star's total emitted light changes, but the question is about the photospheric temperature when spots are present. 

The key here is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio is observed to decrease when there are spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. But I'm not sure if that's relevant right now.

In the photosphere, the star is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for population ratios. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

So, the ratio R = (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio R is lower. We need to find the factor by which R changes when the star doesn't have spots (T = 6000 K) compared to when it does (T = 5500 K). 

Wait, but wait a second
