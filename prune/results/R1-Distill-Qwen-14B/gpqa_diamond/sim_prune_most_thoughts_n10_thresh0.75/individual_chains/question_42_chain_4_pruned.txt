Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me information about three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The main data points are about their equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios, and I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

So the given ratios are:

- Equilibrium temperature Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Equilibrium temperature Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35.
- Albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth.

Wait, and we're asked about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet relates to its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = (L / (16πσ))*(1/(a^2))*( (1 - abedo) )^(1/4) )^0.5? Wait, no, let's get that right. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), where T_star is the star's temperature. But wait, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature T of a planet is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, maybe another approach. Alternatively, the formula I remember is T = ( ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16πσd^2) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the
