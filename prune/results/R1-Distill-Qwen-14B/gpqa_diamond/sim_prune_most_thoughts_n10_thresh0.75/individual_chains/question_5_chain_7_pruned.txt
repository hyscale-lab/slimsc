Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

The question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions.

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, wait. The operator P is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So it's a vector operator, right? So P is the vector sum of its components: P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n would be zero. So the direction is along some angle θ from the x-axis towards the z-axis. That means n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. But since it's in the x-z plane, the angle is θ from the x-axis towards z.

But wait, the operator P for a given direction n is the component in the direction of n. So the operator is P_n = n · P, which would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator whose eigenvector we're seeking is P·n, which is the component of P in the direction of n.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is a spin operator. Because for a muon, which has spin-1/2, the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z have similar forms to the given P components. But here it's P, not S. Maybe
