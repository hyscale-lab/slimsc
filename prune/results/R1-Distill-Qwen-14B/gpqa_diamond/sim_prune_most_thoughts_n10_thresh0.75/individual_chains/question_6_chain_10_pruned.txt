Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for energy E in terms of quantum numbers and some constants.

Wait, okay, first I should probably visualize the potential. The potential has two terms: one is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions, right? Because the 2D harmonic oscillator has V(r) = (1/2)mω² r², so the term is similar, just with k instead of mω² maybe.

The other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta suggests it's varying with the angle θ. So the potential isn't spherically symmetric because it depends on θ. That means the problem isn't separable in spherical coordinates in the usual way. Hmm, so maybe I need to switch to a different coordinate system or see if it can be rewritten in terms of other variables.

Wait, in two dimensions, sometimes it's useful to go to polar coordinates, but given that the potential has a cos²θ term, perhaps it's better to use prolate or some other spheroidal coordinates? Or maybe change variables to make the problem separable.

Alternatively, another approach: can I separate the potential into radial and angular parts? Let me think. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's factor out r²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] = kr² [ (1 + 3cos²θ)/2 ].

Hmm, 1 + 3cos²θ can be rewritten using some trigonometric identities. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V = kr² [ (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ ] / 2? Wait, no, let me recheck. Wait, the expression inside the brackets was (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. So substituting cos²θ:

(1 + 3*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 )) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that properly. Let me take it step by step:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 )
= 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ)
= 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ
= (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ
= (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = kr² * [ (5/2) + (3/2) cos2
