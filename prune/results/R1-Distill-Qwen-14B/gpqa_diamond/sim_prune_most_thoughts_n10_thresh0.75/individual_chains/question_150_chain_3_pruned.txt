Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The reagents it's reacting with are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The NMR data is provided, and I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, I should look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Okay, so the triplet around 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other peaks: the doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 suggest aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, so maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. The doublets could be from two equivalent protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, a monosubstituted benzene where two protons are adjacent to the substituent.

Wait, but there are two doublets each for 2H. So perhaps two benzene rings are present. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different para-substituted benzene rings. Or maybe one ring with substituents causing two sets of doublets.

Wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the presence of N and O might indicate something else. Wait, the starting material has an aldehyde (from the 9.72 ppm peak), some aromatic rings, and perhaps an amino group or something else.

Wait, wait, let me think about the molecular formula again: C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's calculate that: (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two benzene rings (each with three degrees) and a double bond or ring.

Wait, but two benzene rings would be six degrees. Wait, no. Each ring is a degree. Wait, no, each ring or double bond is a degree. Each benzene ring has three double bonds, so each contributes three degrees. Two benzene rings would be six, but that's more than five. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's recalculate: 2*8 + 2 = 18. 18 -9=9. Plus N is 1, so 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees.

So possibilities: maybe one benzene ring (3), one double bond (1), and maybe a ring? Or two rings and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and another ring (1), totaling 5. Or another combination.

Wait, perhaps the compound has one benzene ring and another ring, like a cyclopropane? Or perhaps a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring and another conjugated system, maybe an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde).

Looking back at the NMR. The triplet
