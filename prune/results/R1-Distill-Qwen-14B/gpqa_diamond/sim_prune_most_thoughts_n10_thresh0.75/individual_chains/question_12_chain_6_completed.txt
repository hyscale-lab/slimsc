Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see... The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. The problem says Pi(+) is stationary, which probably means it's not moving, so its initial momentum is zero. 

The given data are the rest masses. Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are a bit tricky because they have such a tiny mass, maybe negligible compared to the other particles here. So I can probably treat the neutrino's rest mass as zero, right?

So, the question is about finding the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino. The options give pairs of energies, so I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to balance each other out. 

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy will just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible. 

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV (rest mass of pion)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV (rest mass of muon)
- E_mu = rest energy of muon + kinetic energy = m_mu c² + K_mu
- E_nu = kinetic energy of neutrino = K_nu

So, conservation of energy gives:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
Which is:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

And for momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Momentum p is related to energy via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the muon, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. For the neutrino, since m_nu is negligible, E_nu ≈ p c.

So, because their momenta are equal and opposite, the magnitudes are the same. So, p_mu = p_nu. 

Let me write that:

p_mu = p_nu = p

So for the muon: E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2
For the neutrino: E_nu = p c

So now I have two equations:

1. 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
2. (105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Wait, let me substitute E_mu as (105.7 + K_mu) and E_nu as K_nu. Because E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu is zero).

So equation 2 becomes:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

I can expand equation 1:

K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV

So equation 1 is: K_mu + K_nu = 33.9

Let me write equation 2 again:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = K_nu^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:
(105.7)^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = K_nu^2 + (105.7)^2

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:
2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = K_nu^2

Now, from equation 1, K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu

Substitute K_nu into equation 2:

2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:
(33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu^2

So equation becomes:

2*105.7 K_mu + K_mu² = 33.9² - 2*33.9 K_mu + K_mu²

Subtract K_mu² from both sides:

2*105.7 K_mu = 33.9² - 2*33.9 K_mu

Bring all terms to one side:

2*105.7 K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu - 33.9² = 0

Factor out K_mu:

K_mu (2*105.7 + 2*33.9) = 33.9²

Calculate the coefficients:

2*(105.7 + 33.9) = 2*139.6 = 279.2

So,

K_mu * 279.2 = (33.9)^2

33.9 squared is 33.9 *33.9. Let me compute that:

33.9 *33.9 = (30 +3.9)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*3.9 + 3.9^2 = 900 + 234 + 15.21 = 900+234=1134, 1134 +15.21=1149.21.

So,

K_mu *279.2 = 1149.21

So K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

1149.21 divided by 279.2.

Hmm. Let me see:

279.2 *4 = 1116.8

279.2 *4.1= 1116.8 +27.92= 1144.72

279.2 *4.12= 1144.72 + 279.2 *0.02= 5.584 → 1150.304

Wait, wait:

Wait, 279.2 *4 = 1116.8

So 4.1 is 1144.72. 4.12 is 4.1 + 0.02. 279.2 *0.02=5.584. So 1144.72 +5.584=1150.304.

But 1149.21 is just slightly less than 4.12 *279.2. Let me see the difference: 1150.304 -1149.21=1.094. So 1.094/279.2 ≈ 0.0039.

So approximately 4.12 -0.0039= ~4.116.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me think in terms of division.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier: 1.14921 / 0.2792.

Wait, maybe:

0.2792 * 4 = 1.1168

So 4.1168 is 0.2792 *4.1.

Wait, because 0.2792 *4.1= 0.2792*(4 +0.1)= 1.1168 +0.02792= 1.14472.

So 0.2792 *4.1=1.14472.

But our numerator is 1.14921, so 1.14921 -1.14472=0.00449.

So, 0.00449 left. How much more?

0.2792 *x ≈0.00449.

x≈0.00449 /0.2792 ≈0.016.

So x≈0.016.

So total is 4.1 +0.016=4.116.

So K_mu ≈4.116 MeV.

Wait, but let me check: 4.116 *279.2 = ?

4 *279.2=1116.8

0.116 *279.2 = 0.1 *279.2=27.92; 0.016 *279.2=4.4672. So total 27.92 +4.4672=32.3872. So 1116.8+32.3872=1149.1872.

Which is very close to 1149.21, so K_mu≈4.116 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then, K_nu =33.9 -4.116=29.784 MeV, approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the neutrino. Since neutrinos have such tiny rest mass, perhaps their kinetic energy is approximately their total energy. So I think I handled that correctly.

Also, let me make sure about the signs and steps. Did I use all the correct substitutions?

Another approach is to compute the energies.

The total energy after decay is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the available energy for kinetic is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino? Because the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is all kinetic. But no, wait, because the muon's energy is its rest mass plus kinetic. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9, which is correct.

But wait, the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9, but the way I set the equations up, K_mu + K_nu =33.9.

But in reality, because of the energy-momentum relation, the sum is not just the kinetic energies but includes the rest mass for the muon.

Hmm, no, because the muon's energy is E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu + K_mu) + K_nu. And that's equal to m_pi.

So, m_pi = m_mu + K_mu + K_nu. So, K_mu + K_nu = m_pi - m_mu = 33.9 MeV.

So that part is correct.

Now, the other equation comes from the momentum conservation and energy-momentum relation.

So, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + m_mu² c^4

E_nu² = (p c)^2 (since m_nu is zero)

But E_nu = K_nu.

So, from E_mu² = (p c)^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 → equation (1)

E_nu = p c → equation (2)

So substituting equation (2) into equation (1):

E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + m_mu^2 c^4.

Which gives us the second equation.

So, substituting E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, and E_nu= K_nu, the equation becomes:

(m_mu + K_mu)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + m_mu^2.

Expanding that, we get the same equation as before.

So, yes, the steps seem correct.

So, K_mu ≈4.12 MeV, K_nu≈29.8 MeV. That's option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) has a negligible rest mass. The goal is to find the kinetic energies (\(K_{\mu}\) and \(K_{\nu}\)) of the muon and neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2.
\]  
The energy of the muon is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]  
The energy of the neutrino is purely kinetic since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]  
Thus, conservation of energy gives:
\[
m_{\pi} c^2 = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we find:
\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
\]  
This simplifies to:
\[
K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let the magnitude of their momenta be \(p\). Using the energy-momentum relation:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2, \quad E_{\nu}^2 = (p c)^2.
\]  
For the muon:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
For the neutrino:
\[
E_{\nu}^2 = (p c)^2.
\]  
Equating the two expressions for \((p c)^2\), we get:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = E_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = 105.7 + K_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\), this becomes:
\[
(105.7 + K_{\mu})^2 = (K_{\nu})^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

### Solving the Equations
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
(105.7 + K_{\mu})^2 = K_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
\[
(105.7)^2 + 2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = K_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Canceling \((105.7)^2\) from both sides:
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = K_{\nu}^2.
\]  
From the energy conservation equation, \(K_{\nu} = 33.9 - K_{\mu}\). Substituting this into the equation:
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu})^2.
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2.
\]  
Subtracting \(K_{\mu}^2\) from both sides:
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} = 33.9^2 - 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu}.
\]  
Rearranging terms:
\[
2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu} + 2 \cdot 33.9 \cdot K_{\mu} = 33.9^2.
\]  
Factoring out \(K_{\mu}\):
\[
K_{\mu} \cdot (2 \cdot 105.7 + 2 \cdot 33.9) = 33.9^2.
\]  
Simplify the coefficients:
\[
K_{\mu} \cdot 279.2 = 1149.21.
\]  
Solving for \(K_{\mu}\):
\[
K_{\mu} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Substituting \(K_{\mu}\) into \(K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9\):
\[
K_{\nu} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
