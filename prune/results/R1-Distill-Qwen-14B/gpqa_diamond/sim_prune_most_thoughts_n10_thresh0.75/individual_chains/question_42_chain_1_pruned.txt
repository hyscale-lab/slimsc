Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects the way we calculate their orbital periods here, so maybe I can set that aside for now.

The question gives me ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios. Specifically, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. Also, the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth's. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.

Hmm, so we need to find the ratio Period3 / Period1. The options are given as A to D, with numbers around 3 to 33.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5, right? Or wait, maybe it's T = T_star * (L/(16πσ a² (1 - albedo)))^½. Wait, no, maybe another approach. The basic formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), assuming the planet is a blackbody and albedo is considered. But wait, the albedo is (1 - A), so maybe the formula includes that factor. Let me get that right.

Oh wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is often given as T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - A) / (1 - A_planet) ), but since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that factor becomes the same for all. So perhaps that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Let me denote T1 as Planet1's temperature, T2 as Planet2's, and T3 as Planet3's. So T1/T2 = 1.4, or T2 = T1 / 1.4. Wait, no, wait the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, so T1 is hotter than T2 by 1.4 times. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 1.4, that could mean T1 is 1.4 times T2. So T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3, so T2 = 2.3 * T3. That would make T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3 = 3.22 * T3. Wait, but maybe I
