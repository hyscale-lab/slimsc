Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem, and I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

Alright, let's break down the information given. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I think the width relates to the lifetime somehow. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units and constants here.

First, I should calculate the lifetime τ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the particle. Since the meson is produced with energy E, which is much higher than its rest mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV, and E is 8 GeV), I can approximate the velocity as being very close to the speed of light. But to get a more precise calculation, maybe I should use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is γ m v, and since v ≈ c, p ≈ γ m c. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that for high-energy particles, E ≈ pc. Because E is much larger than m c², the term m c² is negligible. So yeah, E ≈ pc. That should make things easier.

So, p ≈ E / c. Wait, but I should check if E is much larger than m c². Let me calculate m c². m is 1.2 GeV/c² (
