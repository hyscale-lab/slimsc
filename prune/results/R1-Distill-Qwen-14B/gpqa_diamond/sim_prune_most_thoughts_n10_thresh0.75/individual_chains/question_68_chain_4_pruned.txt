Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, right?

The question says that the particle's magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. Oh wait, I remember that S_z is the z-component of the spin operator. So mu is aligned with the magnetic field initially. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, and then it's turned off and suddenly another field along +Y is turned on with the same magnitude B. The problem asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, when the magnetic field is along Z, the system is in an eigenstate of S_z. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, the energy levels would be proportional to S_z times B. But when the field is suddenly turned off and turned on in the Y direction, the situation changes. Oh right, when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly like that, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the particle's state remains the same, but the Hamiltonian does.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Hmm, because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -mu·B. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu, and the field is B. So H should be proportional to mu · B, which is gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H = gamma B S_y, or with a negative sign maybe? Wait, the standard form is H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Oh right, because the energy is E = -mu·B. So if mu is gamma S_z, then H = -gamma B S_z when B is along Z. But in this case, B is along Y, so H becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Or wait, maybe without the negative? I'm a bit fuzzy on the sign conventions here. But perhaps the exact sign won't affect the frequency, just the phase. Let me proceed.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the state is |+z> or |−z>. After the field is turned on along Y, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian H = gamma B S_y (assuming the sign is correct). Wait, no, earlier I thought H would be negative, but perhaps it's better to write it as H = -gamma B S_y. Because the energy is E = -mu·B, and mu = gamma S_z, but when B is in Y, mu·B is gamma S_z * B_y, which is zero because S_z and B_y are perpendicular. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe the Hamiltonian is H = mu · B, which would be gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, that becomes gamma B S_y. But I'm not entirely sure about the sign, but for the purposes of finding the oscillation frequency, the sign might not matter because frequency is a positive
