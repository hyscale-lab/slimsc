Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. When they ran the 1H NMR of the crude compound, everything looks like it should, except for two peaks that come from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected. They also ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So what's going on?

The options are A to D. Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it were a precursor, the mass would be different. But in the question, both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So A is probably not right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight. Their NMR would show the same peaks because they're identical in terms of structure except for configuration. But wait, in NMR, if you have a racemic mixture (equal enantiomers), the protons that are equivalent in each enantiomer would show as a single peak. Unless the sample is not pure. But in this case, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So maybe if the molecule has some kind of symmetry, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps if the molecule has different diastereomers?

Wait, but the question says the peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So if it's a racemic mixture, wouldn't that alpha-proton see the same environment in each enantiomer, so it would be a singlet? Or maybe not. Wait, in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same number of protons, but in the NMR, you can't tell the difference between enantiomers because they have the same environment. So why two peaks? That doesn't make sense. So maybe B isn't the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Double coupling might refer to some kind of coupling during the reaction, maybe like in an EDC coupling where sometimes by-products form, but double coupling in NMR? Or perhaps it's an artifact in the NMR, but the question states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So this option might not be the cause of the peaks. I'm a bit hazy on this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If the molecule has multiple stereocenters, then you could have diastereomers. Each would have different environments for the protons, so the alpha-proton might split into two peaks. Since the peaks are similar in shift, maybe the diastereomers are close in structure, leading to similar shifts. Also, in LC-MS, if you have two diastereomers, they would have the same mass but different retention times, explaining the two peaks with same mass but appearing separately. 

Wait, but wait. LC-MS: the two peaks have the same mass. So they must be the same molecular weight. So possible explanations are enantiomers or diastereomers. But diastereomers have different physical properties, so their retention times would differ. Enantiomers would have the same retention time because the column can't tell them apart. Oh, right, unless the column is chiral. But the question says the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, implying they separated. So if the peaks separated, the compounds must be diastereomers, because enantiomers wouldn't separate on a regular column.

So going back to the NMR. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the same proton, say an alpha H, would be in different environments in each diastereomer. So each diastereomer could cause that proton to split into two peaks. Hence, you'd see two peaks for the same proton, same integral but different shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So if the diastereomers are very similar, the shifts could be close. Also, the integrals add up to 1H, which makes sense because each isomer contributes 1H but in the mixture, you see each as separate peaks. But wait, the integral for each peak would be roughly 0.5H each? Or maybe the same, but if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each H would split, so each peak is 1H but per isomer? Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: if the sample is a 50-50 mix of two diastereomers, each with the same alpha H, then in the NMR, each diastereomer's alpha H would give a peak. So for each diastereomer, the alpha H would be a single peak, but when in a mixture, they might overlap a bit, but if their shifts are similar, perhaps they would split into two. Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers are in a way that the same proton is coupled differently, leading to splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the compound is a racemic mix, but that wouldn't show two peaks in the NMR for the same proton because the protons are in the same environment. So racemic mix (B) probably isn't the answer.

Putting it together: The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha H, same integral, similar shifts. The LC-MS shows two peaks same mass. So possible diastereomers, which would have same mass, different retention times, and their protons would show as two peaks if their environments are different but similar.

So the most likely option is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, and the LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
  A precursor would have a different molecular weight, but the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule. This rules out contamination with a precursor.  

- **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
  Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have the same molecular weight. However, in an NMR spectrum, enantiomers would not produce separate peaks for the same proton because they are indistinguishable in terms of chemical environment. Additionally, LC-MS peaks for enantiomers would typically co-elute on a non-chiral column, which contradicts the observation of two distinct peaks. Thus, this option is unlikely.  

- **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
  "Double coupling" could refer to an artifact in the reaction, but the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence in the data to support this explanation.  

- **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
  Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties. This explains why the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass but different retention times. In the NMR spectrum, the two diastereoisomers would place the same alpha-proton in slightly different chemical environments, resulting in two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
