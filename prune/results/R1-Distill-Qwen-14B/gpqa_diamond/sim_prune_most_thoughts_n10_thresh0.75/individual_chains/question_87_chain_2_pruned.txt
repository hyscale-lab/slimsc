Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring, right? And the total number of carbon atoms is 8. Hmm, so the ring itself is 6-membered, which is like a benzene ring, so 6 carbons there. The substituents must add up to 2 more carbons because 6 + 2 = 8? Or wait, maybe each substituent can have multiple carbons. Let me think. Oh wait, no, di-substituted just means two substituent groups, each can have multiple carbons.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl or Ar-Br). So the compound has both a carbonyl and an aryl halide group. So the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl group and a halogen, right? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen. Wait, but wait, wait. No, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and a halogen. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen
