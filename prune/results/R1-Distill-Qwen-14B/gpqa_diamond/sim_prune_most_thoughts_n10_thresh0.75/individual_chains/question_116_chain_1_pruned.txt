Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm not super confident about all the concepts yet, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure. Let's think about what these signals mean.

A triplet usually comes from neighboring two protons. So, 6H as a triplet might be from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Because 6H divided by 2 (each CH3 has 3H) would be two CH3 groups. So maybe it's a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2..., but wait, if it's a triplet, each of the CH3's would be next to a CH2 group.

Wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to a CH that has three neighboring protons. Wait, no, a quartet is when each proton has two neighboring protons, each with two protons (like a CH2 adjacent to a CH2). Or maybe a quartet arises from coupling with a neighboring group that has three equivalent protons. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In NMR, the number of peaks in a multiplet is determined by the number of neighboring protons plus one. So a triplet (two neighboring groups) would have n=2, giving 3 peaks. Quartet is n=3, giving 4 peaks.

So the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. That's probably a CH2CH2 group where each CH2 is next to another CH2. Wait, but 4H in a quartet. Wait, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH3?
