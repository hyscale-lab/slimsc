Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³ volume, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- ions in the solution. 

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are phosphate buffer components. I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you form a buffer solution. So in this case, KH2PO4 is probably H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). 

Wait, wait, let me think about the salts. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and some water, but the water part isn't important here because it's just a hydrate. So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

But wait, in the context of H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid, the dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So the species in the solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These can act as a buffer pair. So the solution is a buffer, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Once we have the pH, we can determine the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-? Or the other way around?

No, wait. Buffer solutions are made of a weak acid and its conjugate base. So H2PO4^- is the acid that can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-. So H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 +
