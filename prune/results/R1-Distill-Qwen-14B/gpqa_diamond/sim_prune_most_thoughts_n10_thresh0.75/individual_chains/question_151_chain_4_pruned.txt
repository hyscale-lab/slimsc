Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the probabilities come from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of those operators.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, so that's a vector in three-dimensional space. Oh right, probably it's a state vector |ψ⟩. But wait, I should check if it's normalized. To find that, I need to calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So the components are -1, 2, 1. Squaring each: 1, 4, 1. Sum is 6. Oh, but wait, the state vector has to be normalized, right? Because the probabilities must add up to 1. So maybe this vector isn't normalized. I might have to normalize it first before proceeding.

Then there's the observable P, which is a matrix. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I'm trying to visualize this matrix.

Wait, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors in the state.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P. But wait, how do I do that? I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down matrix P:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I).

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
