Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the harmonic oscillator is a common system to study because of its nice mathematical properties and its relevance to various physical situations.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. Wait, the third excited state—right, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the first excited is the next one, second, then third. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of quantum numbers.

The potential is given as V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², which is the standard isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh, right, in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends only on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of nx, ny, nz, but wait, no, actually in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is nx + ny + nz, where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers. Or wait, no, is that correct? Or is n the sum with each being at least 1? No, I think in the 3D isotropic case, each direction (x, y, z) is a 1D oscillator, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

Wait, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = nx + ny + nz. But wait, each of nx, ny, nz can be 0, 1, 2, etc. So for each state, the energy is determined by the total n.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In 3D, the energy levels are degenerate. The ground state (n=0) is non-degenerate, but as n increases, the degeneracy increases.

Alternatively, sometimes the principal quantum number is considered as n = nx + ny + nz + 3, but no, that doesn't seem right. I think the correct formula is E = ( (nx
