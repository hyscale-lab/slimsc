Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Alright, the question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. So, the current situation is 1/3 reach the walls, and they want to find the factor that changes that to 2/3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the problem must be related to the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls before decaying. Because if they decay before reaching the walls, they won't be detected. So the particles have to travel a certain distance before decaying. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel without decaying is 30 meters. 

But wait, particles are produced at the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, it must travel at least 30 meters before decaying. But since they're moving at a certain velocity, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame affects how far they go.

So, I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as gamma multiplied by tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau.

The maximum distance the particle can travel is its velocity multiplied by its lifetime. So distance = v * t. Since the velocity is relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but the particle is moving at a speed close to c. So v â‰ˆ c. So D = c * gamma * tau. But we know that the detector's radius is 30 meters, so that's the maximum distance. So the particles that reach the inner walls must have D >= 30 m.

But the problem says that when the Lorentz factor is 20, only 1/3 reach the walls.
