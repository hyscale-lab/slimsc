Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, let's see what it says.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. Oh wait, c is h over 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I remember that matrices like this often come up in spin systems, maybe spin-1/2 particles?

The problem asks which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to calculate the eigenvalues and see which options fit.

First, let me write down the matrix Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the given 2x2 matrix. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S
Which means:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix is:
[ (h/(4π))*0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ]

Simplifying, that's:
[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

Wait, or is it?

Wait, no, the matrix S is as given. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so when multiplied by c = h/(4π), each element is multiplied by that. So Ay's elements are:

First row: 0 and (-i) * (h/(4π))
Second row: (i) * (h/(4π)) and 0.

So the matrix is:
[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:
[ -a, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Calculating that second term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. And (h/(4π))² is (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant equation is a² - [ h²/(16 π²) * 1 ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait no, wait, h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²), so a² = h²/(16 π²) * (1) because we have:

Wait, determinant is a^2 - (h²/(16 π² )) =0. So a^
