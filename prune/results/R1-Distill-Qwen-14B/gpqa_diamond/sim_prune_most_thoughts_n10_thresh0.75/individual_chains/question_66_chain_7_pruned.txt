Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first I need to remember what each of these symmetries means and whether they're required in SMEFT.

So, SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are typically organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. These operators are supposed to modify the SM in a systematic way.

Now, symmetries. The SM respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT is an extension, so I'd expect that the same symmetries hold unless explicitly broken by the higher-dimension operators. But wait, noâ€”operators in SMEFT can break some symmetries if they're not invariant under them.

Wait no, actually. SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimension operators that are compatible with the SM symmetries. Oh wait, that's not quite right. The SMEFT operators are constructed to preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So they must be invariant under the SM's gauge group and other symmetries.

Wait, but the question is specifically about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these options are symmetries that SMEFT must preserve, regardless of the operators.
