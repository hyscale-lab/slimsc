Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions. I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a type of conjugate addition, right?

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. It's a good enolate precursor because it's a diethyl ester, so the base can easily deprotonate it. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would be on the central carbon, which is the alpha position. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3, but wait, no, wait: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl) substituted. So the structure is CH2-CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta position. So that would make it CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, wait: the position is 3-(p-tolyl), so numbering from the ester group.

Wait, maybe not. Let me draw the structure. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the substituent is on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3. Now, 3-substituted would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the same carbon as the carbonyl. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is on the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but that would be 3-p-tolylpropenoic acid methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But wait, that's 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate, not 3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CO-O
