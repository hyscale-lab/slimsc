Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're asked to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix is given as Aij. The matrix A has elements where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Oh, I think that's an off-diagonal matrix with those hbar/2 values.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when we have an operator, the eigenstates of that operator are the basis states for the possible measurement outcomes. So, to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

But first, I need to figure out what the eigenstates of operator A are. Because without knowing the basis, I can't proceed. Hmm. The matrix A is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, so |up> and |down> are the computational basis states.

The operator A has elements A12 = A21 = ħ/2, and the diagonal elements A11 and A22 are 0. So the matrix looks like this:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Hmm, that reminds me of the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and our A is similar but scaled. So operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Since Pauli matrices have eigenvalues +1 and -1, operator A will have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A as well, because A is a scalar multiple of σ_x. The eigenstates for σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Because σ_x flips the spin states.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, where:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2

Now, we need to express the given |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->. Once we have the coefficients in this basis, the probabilities will be the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

But wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I should normalize it first. Let's compute the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so let me compute the norm. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) because the cross terms would involve up and down, and since they're orthogonal, the inner product would be zero.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.
(2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me write |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of |+> and |->. Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

So, substituting |+> and |->,

|alpha> = c_+ [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + c_- [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

Grouping terms for |up> and |down>,

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we know |alpha> is equal to [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_- ) ] / sqrt(2)
(2-i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ - c_- ) ] / sqrt(2)

So, setting the coefficients equal:

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Now, let's solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding the two equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So, c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, subtracting the equations:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So, c_- = (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = (-1 + 2i)/ (sqrt(14)) )

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's compute (1+i)+(2-i) = 3 +0i. So yes.

So,

c_+ = [ (3) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) ] / 2 = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )= (3/(sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= -1 + 2i.

So,

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) ] / 2 = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Which can be written as (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) because sqrt(2)/(2) = 1/sqrt(2), but wait, sqrt(2)/(2) = 1/sqrt(2), so 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) is 1/sqrt(14). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recompute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write them in terms of the new basis.

Another approach: Let me write the equation |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->, which can be written as:

c_+ = < + | alpha >
c_- = < - | alpha >

So, since |+> and |-> are (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down> ) and (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down> ), respectively,

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] |alpha> 

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| alpha> + <down| alpha> )

Similarly,

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| alpha> - <down| alpha> )

We know that <up| alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down| alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

= [1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)))] * (3 + 0i )

= 3/(sqrt(14) )

Similarly,

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ -1 + 2i ]

So, yes, that's correct.

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Calculating |c_+|^2:

(3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286. So about 0.64.

|c_-|^2 = [ (-1 + 2i )^2 ] / (14 )

Wait, wait. Let's compute |c_-|^2:

c_- = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14 )

So |c_-|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, (-1 + 2i) is a complex number. The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 is 5/(14) ≈ 0.357.

But the options don't have exactly 0.64 and 0.36. Let me check the answer options.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which sum to 14/14=1, which is correct.

So that's the first part: probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of operator A. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is expressed in terms of the Pauli X matrix, perhaps we can compute it using the expectation value in the computational basis.

But since we have |alpha> in the computational basis, perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

The operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) (|up><down| + |down><up| )

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ <alpha| up><down |alpha> + <alpha| down><up |alpha> ]

Compute each term:

<alpha| up> = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
<alpha| down> = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So,

<alpha| up><down |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^* [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Similarly, <alpha| down><up |alpha> = [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^* [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (2 +i)(1 -i) ] /7.

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i)^* (2 -i) = (1 -i)(2 -i )

Multiply them:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i )

= 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so:

2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So the first term is (1 -3i)/7.

Second term: (2 -i)^*(1 +i) = (2 +i)(1 +i )

Multiplying:

2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i +i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so:

2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So the second term is (1 +3i)/7.

Adding the two terms:

(1 -3i +1 +3i ) /7 = (2)/7. The imaginary parts cancel.

So the expectation value:

(ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7. So yes, that's the one.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The first step is to normalize this state. The norm squared is calculated as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This operator is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]

Expanding \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) in terms of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we equate coefficients and solve:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(|+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, we calculate the average value of \( A \), which is the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]

Expanding \( \sigma_x \) in terms of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{2}{7} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
