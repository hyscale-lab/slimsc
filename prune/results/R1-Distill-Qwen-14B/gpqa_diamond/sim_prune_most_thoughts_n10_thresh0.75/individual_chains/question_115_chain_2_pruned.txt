Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

So the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to calculate velocity directly. Since the particles are annihilating, their rest masses will convert into energy for the photons.

Wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass, right? So each has a rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV. But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since they are moving, their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energies.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that both photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy E. The total energy of the system before annihilation should be the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

So let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Since they annihilate into two photons, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

The initial system consists of an electron moving left to right? Wait, wait, no. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis. So the electron is moving to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left. They collide head-on.

Wait, wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving from the right along the same axis, so its velocity is to the left. So they're moving towards each other. That makes sense for a collision.

Now, each has a Lorentz factor (gamma). The electron has gamma_e =4, the positron gamma_p =2.

So their total energy is gamma_e * m_e c
