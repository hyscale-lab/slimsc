Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and their iron atoms in the photosphere. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, Boltzmann distribution tells us about the population of different energy states based on temperature.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that's the energy difference ΔE between the two levels.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The ratio of the populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the excitation is such that star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2. Wait, no, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, the specific energy level. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited state (let's say n2) to the ground state (n1) would be given by their respective temperatures.

Wait,
