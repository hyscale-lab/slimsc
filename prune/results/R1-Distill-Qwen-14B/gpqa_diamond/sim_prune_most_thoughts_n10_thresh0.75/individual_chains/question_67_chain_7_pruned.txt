Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. The question is about the coupled angular momentum state of two electrons.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me break that down. The first two numbers are l1 and l2, which are both 1. So each electron is in a p orbital. The next two numbers are l and m. So l is 2, which is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. m is -1, so the z-component of the total angular momentum is -ħ.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring L1z and L2z for each electron. Oh right, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the individual electrons' orbital angular momenta. So I need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ each.

I think I remember that the total angular momentum L is the sum of the individual angular momenta. So L = L1 + L2. But the state is given in terms of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. So perhaps I need to express this state as a combination of states where L1z and L2z are known.

The state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, but the notation is a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, the state is given in terms of the coupled basis, which is the total angular momentum. So it's the eigenstate of L² and Lz, where L is the sum of L1 and L2.

But to find the probability of getting specific values for L1z and L2z, I might need to break this state into the product basis where each electron's orbital angular momentum is considered separately. Because in the product basis, the state would be a combination of |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> states.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possible m1 and m2 values that add up to the total m of -1, given that l1 and l2 are 1 each.

Wait, because each electron has l=1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. The total m is m1 + m2 = -1.

So, looking for all
