Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of formation isn't my strongest topic. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question asks me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I need to figure out the structure first. Maybe it's a conjugated diene or something similar? But wait, the exact structure might not matter right now. The key is the enthalpy of formation, which I remember is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The data provided includes enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an atom, right? So for carbon, each bond would require 1000 kJ/mol. I think that's the energy to break a C-C bond, but wait, no, the given values are bond energies. Wait, no, the question says enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe that's the value for each C-C bond breaking. Or perhaps it's the energy to convert carbon into an atom? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the question gives bond energies for several bonds. So maybe the enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to break a C-C bond in graphite or something? Or perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to completely separate all the bonds in a carbon atom. Oh wait, no, atomization is about the energy to break bonds in an atom, so for carbon, which typically has four bonds, the atomization energy would be the energy to break all four bonds in a carbon atom. But wait, the given value is 1000 kJ/mol. So for each C-C bond, perhaps it's 1000 divided by 4? Or wait, maybe the bond energies given are per bond, and the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C-C bonds broken?

Wait, the given bond energies are:

- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ
