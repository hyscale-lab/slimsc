Okay, I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

So, the problem states that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, I remember that synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating voltage. Unlike the cyclotron, which has a fixed magnetic field, the synchrocyclotron's field increases as the particles gain energy.

The key here is probably to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of revolutions. But how?

I recall that in cyclotrons, the time it takes for a particle to complete a revolution (the cyclotron period) depends on the magnetic field. But here, the magnetic field might be changing, which affects the period. However, I'm not sure about the exact approach.

Wait, the problem mentions two accelerations. Oh, right, in each acceleration, the proton goes through a half-revolution, gaining energy each time it's accelerated. So each time it completes a half-circle, it gets a kick from the electric field. Therefore, the number of revolutions would be related to the number of these kicks.

So, if the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV, does that mean it makes two half-revolutions, so one full revolution? No, that can't be right because 950 MeV is a lot of energy, so it must have gone through many revolutions.

Wait, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, each time the proton completes a full revolution, it is accelerated once. Or maybe each half-revolution. I need to clarify.

In a typical cyclotron, the particles are accelerated twice each orbit because the electric field switches direction as they pass through the gap. So each half-revolution corresponds to an acceleration. So, each full revolution gives two energy kicks. Therefore, the number of half-revolutions is twice the number of full revolutions.

But for a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted so that the time for each revolution increases as the proton's energy increases. So, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted to match the changing revolution period.

Wait, the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α)t + Φ0). I think ν(α) is the frequency, which depends on the time because as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, so the cyclotron frequency changes. Synchrocyclotrons adjust the frequency to match the changing angular frequency of the particles.

But regardless of that, the problem gives the initial kinetic energy as negligible and the final as 950 MeV. I need to find how many times it revolves as it gains that energy.

Let me think about energy. The kinetic energy gained per revolution might depend on the accelerating voltage. Each time the proton goes through the accelerating gap, it gains some energy. So perhaps the energy per revolution is related to the voltage U0.

Wait, the potential difference is U(t). So each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains an energy equal to the peak voltage times some factor. Since the voltage is applied as a cosine function, the maximum voltage it can receive each time is U0. But wait, the phase is π/4, so maybe that affects whether each acceleration is in the right direction.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains an energy equal to the voltage applied. So if the voltage is U0, then each half-revolution (each time it passes through the gap) gains U0 * e (elementary charge), but since it's a proton, e is positive, so energy gained per passage is e * U0.

Wait, but U(t) is in volts, so the energy would be e * U(t) integrated over the time when it's accelerated. Or perhaps it's more straightforward: each time the electric field is applied, the proton gains U0 eV per revolution.

But wait, in a cyclotron, the protons are accelerated twice per revolution because each revolution brings them through the gap twice (once at each end of the diameter of the orbit). Wait, no, in a cyclotron, the particles move in a semicircle between the D-shaped electrodes. So each time they go from one electrode to the other, that's a half-revolution, and they get a kick. So each full revolution gives two accelerations, each of about U0 eV.

Wait, but in this problem, it's a synchrocyclotron, which might have a different setup. Maybe each full revolution corresponds to one acceleration.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm, wait, that can't be right, because 950 MeV is a huge energy. Oh wait, no, the problem says it undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Two accelerations would give very little energy. So maybe I'm misunderstanding that part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the proton undergoes two changes in acceleration in the accelerator to reach T1=950 MeV. No, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, maybe the two accelerations refer to the two electrodes in the synchrocyclotron, each providing one acceleration per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the synchrocyclotron has an accelerating voltage that's applied twice each revolution. So each full revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, each time gaining energy U0.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the basics.

In a cyclotron, the particles experience a magnetic field and an electric field. The magnetic field causes them to move in a circle, while the electric field accelerates them each half-revolution.

Each time the particle goes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes, it gains energy. So in each full revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice, so it gets two energy kicks.

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the accelerating voltage. So the time for each revolution increases as the particle's speed increases.

So, the approach to find the number of revolutions is to find out how many times the proton goes through the accelerating voltage to gain the total energy of 950 MeV.

So, the energy per acceleration would be the product of the charge (e) and the voltage (U0). Since each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e*U0 energy.

Wait, but U(t) is a cosine function. So the maximum energy it can gain per passage is e*U0. So each time it goes through the gap, it gains e*U0. If that's the case, then the number of passages needed is T1/(e*U0).

Wait, but T1 is 950 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. The charge of a proton is e, so e*U0 in volts would be e multiplied by 190,000 volts. Let's compute that.

e is 1.6e-19 Coulombs. U0 is 190,000 volts, so e*U0 is (1.6e-19 C) * (1.9e5 V) = 3.04e-14 J. Converting that to eV: since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J is (3.04e-14) / (1.6e-19) = about 1.9e5 eV, which is 190,000 eV, or 190 keV.

So each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains 190 keV. Therefore, the number of times it must pass through is the total energy needed divided by 190 keV.

But wait, the total kinetic energy is 950 MeV. So 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. So 950,000 keV / 190 keV per pass = 5000 passes.

But in a cyclotron, each full revolution corresponds to two passes through the gap. So the number of revolutions would be the number of passes divided by 2.

Wait wait, in a cyclotron, each revolution is two passes. So if the proton passes the gap 5000 times, that's 2500 revolutions. Because 5000 passes = 2500 full revolutions.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is about the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. So if each revolution gives two passes, then number of passes N_pass = 2 * N_rev.

But earlier, I calculated N_pass = 950e3 keV / 190e3 keV/pass = 5000.

So N_rev = 5000 / 2 = 2500. So the answer would be 2500 revolutions, which is option D.

But wait, the given options include 2500 as D. So that would make the answer D) 2500.

But wait, let me double-check. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that can't be right because two accelerations at 190 keV each would only give 380 keV total, which is way below 950 MeV.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Oh wait, perhaps the wording is that the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the question is implying that the proton undergoes two acceleration processes, each with a certain number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps each acceleration is a single application of voltage. No, that's not how it works. Alternatively, perhaps the two accelerations refer to two different stages, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit confusingly phrased. It says, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV." That seems contradictory because two accelerations would only give 2 * U0 * e = 380 keV, which is much less than 950 MeV.

So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore that part of the question because it seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the two accelerations refer to the fact that in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases, so the frequency changes, causing the proton to experience acceleration each time it passes through the gap. But that doesn't directly affect the number of revolutions.

So perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach: each passage (half-revolution) gives 190 keV, so the number of passages is 950e3 keV / 190e3 keV/pass = 5000. So the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500. So option D.

But wait, looking at the options, D is 2500. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I remember that in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is related to the phase change as well. The phase term is 2πν(α)t + Φ0. The phase shift might affect whether the protons are accelerated in the right way. But I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions.

Wait, in order for the proton to be accelerated, the electric field must be in the correct phase when the proton passes through the gap. The phase Φ0 is π/4, which is 45 degrees. So each time the proton comes around, the phase shifts, but I'm not sure how that affects the timing. However, since the problem gives the phase, perhaps it's not necessary for calculating the number of revolutions, just the energy.

Hmm, but perhaps the phase affects the total number of possible accelerations, since the voltage is time-dependent. Wait, but I think the number of revolutions would still be determined by the energy gained per revolution, regardless of the phase. Because the phase would affect the timing but not the total energy per revolution.

So I think the initial approach holds: the number of revolutions is 2500, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time, which means that the cyclotron frequency changes. The frequency ν(α) in the voltage equation must be adjusted to match the particle's angular frequency. So, the time for each revolution increases as the proton gains energy, but the voltage is adjusted to match this.

This means that the number of revolutions would be determined by how much the proton's velocity increases, but since the energy gained per revolution is the same (e*U0), the total number would be the same.

Wait, no, because as the magnetic field increases, the radius of the proton's orbit increases, but the time per revolution depends on both the magnetic field and the velocity.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the time it takes to reach the energy, but that might complicate things. But the problem doesn't give any information about the time, so perhaps the number of revolutions can be found purely based on the energy gained and the energy per revolution.

So going back, if each revolution gives 2 * U0 eV (since each revolution has two passages), then the number of revolutions N is (950e6 eV) / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) 

Wait, 950 MeV is 950,000,000 eV. 190 kV gives 190,000 eV per passage. Each revolution gives two passages, so 380,000 eV per revolution.

So N = 950e6 eV / 380e3 eV/rev = (950,000,000) / (380,000) ≈ 2500.

So yeah, that gives N= 2500, which is option D.

So the answer should be D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the accelerating voltage and the number of revolutions.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The accelerating voltage is given as \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage \( U_0 \). Since the proton is positively charged, the energy gained per passage is \( e \cdot U_0 \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy per passage**:  
   The energy gained per passage is \( e \cdot U_0 \). Converting \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) to electron volts (eV):  
   \[
   e \cdot U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190,000 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Total number of passages**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be gained is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000,000 \, \text{eV} \). The number of passages required is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{pass}} = \frac{T_1}{e \cdot U_0} = \frac{950,000,000}{190,000} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Number of revolutions**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, each full revolution corresponds to two passages through the accelerating gap (one at each end of the orbit). Therefore, the number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{rev}} = \frac{N_{\text{pass}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron. This corresponds to option **D**.
