Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which I remember have to do with the overall wavefunction symmetry. 

The problem gives an equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Wait, but the given note says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So, the term is 1S0—so that's (2S+1)=1, so S=0. L is 0 because it's S, so L=0, and J is 0. So initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting X, the NN state has T(NN) = 0. Pauli's condition comes into play. The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, is that right? Wait, the problem states: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh, so T is the isospin, but maybe here it's the spin? Or wait, wait. T is the isospin; S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but in the equation given, is it T = S + L +1 mod 2? So, for the final state, T is 0. So, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So, S + L must be 1 mod 2, because 0 = (S+L+1) mod 2 → S+L +1 ≡ 0 → S+L ≡ 1 mod 2. So, S + L is odd.

But wait, S is the spin of the NN system after emission. Hmm, but what's the spin of the NN? Well, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0. But after emitting a particle X, the spin of NN will change? Or wait, the NN system's spin is S, and their
