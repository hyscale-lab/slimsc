Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, so I'll need to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, which involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Metathesis typically breaks and reforms the double bonds, so I should figure out what the starting material looks like and how it can rearrange.

The starting compound is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₂CH₃). Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂? No, wait, pent would have five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH3)-? Wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂ something? Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3 is pent-1-ene. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and on C3, there's a methyl group. Let me count: the chain is five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the third carbon (counting from the double bond) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that would be six carbons. Wait, maybe:

3-methylpent-1-ene: The parent chain is five carbons, with the double bond from C1-C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that would imply the chain is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is actually 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let's think about the numbering. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be a branch on carbon 3. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂=CH-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, maybe I should write it as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, because pent has five carbons. Let me make it clear: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be too long. Wait, maybe 3-methylpent-1-ene
