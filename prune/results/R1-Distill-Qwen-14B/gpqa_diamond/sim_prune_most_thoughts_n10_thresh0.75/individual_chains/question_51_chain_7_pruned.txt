Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images might come into play. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

So the problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are all in terms of k, q, R, and d, so I guess I don't have to worry about numerical values, just the expression.

First, I should recall what happens when you have a charge near a conductor. Oh right, image charges. For a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will depend on where the charge is placed. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so charges will redistribute freely. Also, since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but how does this affect the potential energy? Potential energy in electrostatics is usually the work done to assemble the charges, right? So the system's potential energy would depend on the interactions between the charges.

But in this case, the sphere is a conductor. So the charge q induces charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can flow to the ground, but wait, noâ€”because if the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charge would cause a static charge on the sphere. Wait, no, actually, for a grounded conductor, the potential is zero, which means the induced charges can be thought of as
