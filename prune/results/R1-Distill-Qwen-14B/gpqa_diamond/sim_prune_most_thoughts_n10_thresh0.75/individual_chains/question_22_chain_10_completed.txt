Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The statement says that thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Then, kinetically, it reacts …… in acidic solutions. And I need to choose the correct combination from the options.

Hmm. I remember that thermodynamic and kinetic factors are two different things. So, thermodynamics relates to whether a reaction is favorable (spontaneous) based on Gibbs free energy, while kinetics is about how fast the reaction occurs, which depends on activation energy and other factors like concentration and conditions.

First, let's tackle the thermodynamic part. In basic solutions, how is oxygen as an oxidant? I think about the standard reduction potentials. For oxygen, the relevant reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, which has a standard E° of around +0.401 V. In acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O, with E° around +1.23 V. Wait, that's a higher value. So in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidant because its reduction potential is higher. But in basic solution, the E° is lower. Wait, but wait—what determines the strength of an oxidant? The higher the E°, the stronger the oxidizing agent. Because the oxidant is the species that's reduced, right? So O2 is the oxidizing agent in both cases. So in acidic solution, O2 has a higher tendency to be reduced (so it's a stronger oxidant). So in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant. So the first blank should be "weaker".

Now the kinetic part. How does O2 react in acidic vs. basic solutions? Kinetics are about how fast the reaction happens. Factors that affect reaction rate include the concentration of the reactants, the activation energy, and possibly the conditions like pH. I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction involving O2 might proceed faster because H+ ions can help stabilize transition states or participate in the reaction mechanism. For example, when O2 is reacting as an oxidizing agent, like in the oxygen reduction, the reaction in acidic solution might proceed more quickly because the presence of H+ ions lowers the activation energy or makes the reaction more favorable kinetically.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. In basic solution, OH- ions are present. Do they hinder the reaction? Maybe because in basic conditions, the solution is less likely to support the proton transfer steps that might be involved in the reaction mechanism for oxygen's reduction. For instance, the reduction of O2 in acidic solution goes through a mechanism that might involve H+ ions. If the solution is acidic, H+ is abundant, which can facilitate the reaction steps. In basic conditions, OH- might make the reaction slower because it's harder to get the necessary H+ ions for the reaction steps.

So, in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster. So the second blank should be "faster".

Putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. So the correct combination is weaker and faster.

Looking at the options, option C is "weaker – faster", which would be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing—what about factors like the concentration of OH-? Does higher pH make the solution more viscous or something? No, not really. The main thing is the presence of H+ ions in acidic conditions helping the reaction, so the reaction is faster. 

Let me think about the Nernst equation as well. The Nernst equation affects the actual cell potential based on concentrations, but in terms of thermodynamic favorability, it's the E° that determines whether a reaction is spontaneous. But the question is about whether O2 is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions, which we've determined is weaker.

So the first part is weaker, second is faster. So the combination is weaker and faster. Looking at the options, option C is weaker – faster. So the answer should be C.


Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential. For oxygen, the reduction reaction in basic solutions is \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), with a standard reduction potential (\( E^\circ \)) of \( +0.401 \, \text{V} \). In acidic solutions, the reaction is \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \), with \( E^\circ \) of \( +1.23 \, \text{V} \). Since a higher \( E^\circ \) indicates a stronger oxidant, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on factors like the presence of ions that facilitate the reaction mechanism. In acidic solutions, \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can stabilize intermediates and lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. In basic solutions, the absence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions and the presence of \( \text{OH}^- \) ions can hinder the reaction, making it slower. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations: thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. The correct combination is "weaker – faster."
