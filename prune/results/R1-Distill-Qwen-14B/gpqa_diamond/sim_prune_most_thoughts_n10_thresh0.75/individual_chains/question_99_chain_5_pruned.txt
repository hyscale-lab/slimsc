Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me an unknown compound and the results from FTIR and 1H NMR. My job is to identify which structure it matches among the four options. Let's see what we have.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's very broad, that might be more indicative of a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are usually broader and around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around there because the carbonyl is deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. So that suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all of them except maybe one have a COOH group. Let me check:

Option A: Ends with CH2COOH. Oh, yes, COOH is present.
Option B: Ends with COOH as well.
Option C: Ends with CH2COOH.
Option D: Ends with COOH.

So all options have a carboxylic acid group, which makes sense given the IR data. Wait, but wait a second—is that the only possibility? Could the 1700 peak be from something else like an ester or ketone? Well, the broad peak at 3000 might indicate an -OH group, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an ester or ketone. So I think the structure is a carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR part. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds, so the molecule is saturated. The options all look to be alkanes except for the COOH group, which is fine.

The NMR has a few signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex coupling. Let me think about how that arises.

In NMR splitting, each neighboring set of protons causes a splitting. So if a proton has two neighboring groups, each with a certain number of protons, the splitting becomes a multiplet with (n+1)(m+1)... factors.

Wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That suggests three different coupling partners with 1, 2, and 3 neighboring protons? Or maybe each coupling is from different equivalent sets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a result of splitting from adjacent groups. Let me think of a scenario where a proton is next to CH, which is next to CH2, etc.

Wait, maybe it's a geminal coupling? No, geminal protons are on the same carbon, but that's usually not observed because they are equivalent and split each other, but that's for coupling constants like in AB systems. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diastereotopic situation, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a branching that leads to multiple coupling. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the structures:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Wait, the main chain would be something like CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So the carbons next to the COOH are geminal (the two CH(CH3) groups). Hmm.

So the structure would have a central carbon (maybe the one attached
