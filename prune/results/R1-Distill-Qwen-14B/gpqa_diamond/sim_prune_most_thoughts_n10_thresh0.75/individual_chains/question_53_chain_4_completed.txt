Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, let me jot down the key points:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. That means the compound has an ester functional group, O-C-O, right? Esters typically show a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, esters have a certain O-H stretch if they're in an environment where that's possible, but maybe that's not crucial here.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:** There are six signals. Let's break down what each part means.

   - **Two aromatic-H signals:** Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons can come in different patterns. For a di-substituted benzene, depending on the substituents, the aromatic protons can split into two distinct sets. For example, in para substitution, there are two equivalent sets of protons (ortho and meta), but in meta substitution, it might be more complex. Wait, wait. The problem says two signals, so perhaps it's a 1,2,4 substitution or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to two sets of aromatic protons, like para substitution with two substituents in para positions. Hmm, not sure yet.

   - **Two vinyl-H signals:** One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically the ones adjacent to double bonds, like in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring but not in this case because the aromatic ring is di-substituted but probably as a benzene, so the aromatic protons are the ones on the ring. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the aromatic protons here are the two signals, so the vinyl-H must be elsewhere. Oh, perhaps the compound has an ester group where the carbonyl is part of an ester, which could be connected to a vinyl group. Wait, the ester is O-C-O, so maybe the structure is something like an aryl ester. Or perhaps the substituents on the benzene ring include a vinyl group connected to an ester.

   - **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** So there are two sets of methyl groups. Each has its own signal. This could mean that the two methyl groups are in different environments. For example, one could be attached to an oxygen (like in an ester's R-O-CO-O-R?), no wait, in an ester, it's R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps one methyl is part of an alkoxy group (like OCH3) and another is part of an alkyl group attached to the carbonyl (like RCOOR'). Wait, no. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so maybe the methyl groups are on either side. Alternatively, perhaps there are two different methyl groups in the structure. Or maybe one methyl is attached to oxygen (like OCH3) and another is somewhere else, like as a substituent on the benzene ring.

   - **No -CH2 signals:** So we don't have any methylene groups (CH2) in the structure. That suggests that any alkyl chains are either in a CH3 form or in a branching that doesn't include CH2 groups. For example, perhaps a gem-dimethyl group or something else.

So, putting this together, I need to figure out what the structure looks like. Let me think about possible structures with a di-substituted benzene ring and an ester group.

One possibility is that the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group. But wait, the ester would be a substituent like RCOO- attached via an oxygen, making it an aryl ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group connected to an ester.

Wait, another thought: the NMR has vinyl protons, which are likely adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the structure includes a vinyl group attached to the ring, like a styrene group (vinyl benzene), but that's just a benzene with a CH₂CH₂ group, but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH₂CH₂COO something, but that would include CH2 groups again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. Wait, for example, if the benzene has a substituent that's a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-R attached to a vinyl group. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzyl acetate, but that's ethyl ester, which would have CH2CH3 groups, which would show up as a triplet or quartet in NMR, but the problem says there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Another possibility: the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that would be a carbonate, right? Or perhaps an ester where the R groups are methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene, with one substituent being a methyl ester group. Let me think. For example, if the benzene is attached to a group like O-CO-OCH3, but that's a carbonate, not an ester. Wait, no, an ester would be O-CO-O-R attached to something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propenoate ester. Let's say, the ring has a substituent that's a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, something like CH₂=CHCOOCH3. But wait, that's a propenoate ester. So the substituent on the ring would be a CH₂=CHCOO group, which is an ester. But then the structure would be benzene with a substituent like CH₂=CHCOOR, where R is maybe methyl.

But wait, the NMR shows two methyl groups. So in that case, the R could be methyl, giving two CH3 groups: one from the benzene substituent and another from the ester. Hmm, but wait, where would the other methyl come from?

Wait, another approach. Since the ester is present, the formula will have at least O2. The options are C11H14O2, C11H12O2, etc.

Let me consider the molecular formula. Let's think about the possible structures.

Assuming the compound is an ester with a di-substituted benzene ring. Let's say the benzene has two substituents: one is the ester group, and the other could be another group.

Wait, but the NMR has two methyl groups. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group.

Wait, for example, if the benzene ring has two substituents: an ester group and a methyl group. So the structure would be something like benzene with O-CO-O-R and a CH3 group attached. But then, where would the vinyl protons come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. Let's think of a structure like:

Ph-O-CO-R, where R is a vinyl group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent O-CO-R attached to the benzene. If R is CH2CH3, that would be a methyl ester, but that would require CH2 groups, which the NMR says are absent. Alternatively, if R is CH2CH2... No, wait, if R is CH2CH2, that's ethyl, which again has CH2 groups.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about the NMR signals.

The NMR has six signals. Let's list them:

- Two aromatic protons: Since it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that each substituent is in a position that causes the aromatic protons to split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions (meta), the aromatic protons could be split into two sets. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, if it's a para substitution, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets, maybe two doublets.

Wait, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H, so perhaps each substituent is in a position that leads to each aromatic proton being in a unique environment, but I'm not exactly sure how that would work for two substituents.

Next, the vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Wait, vinyl protons are typically split based on neighboring protons. A doublet implies each proton has one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is adjacent to another group that causes splitting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. For example, the structure might have a substituent like CH₂=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring. But that would have a propenoate ester group, which includes a vinyl group (the double bond between C1 and C2). So the vinyl protons would be on the CH₂=CHCOO group. Let's think about that.

In such a structure, the protons on the vinyl group (CH₂ and CH) would split into certain signals. But in the NMR, we have two signals for vinyl-H. Wait, maybe one is a doublet (like the CH₂ group), and the other is a quartet or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the vinyl-H could be part of a substituent like -CH₂-CO-O-R attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's a single bond, so perhaps not. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-CH₂-CH2-O- something? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but again, that might involve CH2 groups, which we don't have signals for.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl group connected via an ester. Hmm, but that might not explain the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-... but that's getting too long.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure again. Since the NMR has two methyl groups, the ester must have two methyl groups attached. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ester is a dimethyl ester. For example, if the benzene ring has a substituent that's a methyl ester, like -O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not right because an ester is R-O-CO-R', so if R is methyl and R' is also methyl, it would be methyl acetate. But wait, in that case, the structure would be something like benzyl acetate, which is Ph-O-CO-OCH3. Hmm, but that would have a benzene ring (di-substituted?), but wait, that's a mono-substituted benzene ring. Wait, no, the question says di-substituted. So maybe the benzene has two substituents: one being the ester group, and another being something else.

Wait, let me draw this out in my mind. Suppose the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (-O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a methyl group (-CH3). So the ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the ring, and a methyl group attached elsewhere. Now, would that structure fit the NMR observations?

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split into two groups, perhaps a doublet and another doublet, depending on the substituents' positions. The ester would have the OCH3 group, which would be a singlet in the NMR. But wait, the NMR has two methyl groups. So one is from the OCH3, and another is from the CH3 substituent on the ring. But wait, the CH3 substituent on the ring would be attached to the ring, and in that case, its protons would be deshielded and would appear as a singlet if there are no neighboring protons. But in the NMR, the two CH3 groups are separate signals, so perhaps one is attached to oxygen (OCH3) and another as a substituent on the ring (as CH3).

But then, where do the vinyl protons come into play? Because the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps the substituent isn't just a simple methyl group but something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Let me think of the structure as benzene with a substituent that's an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, benzene with a substituent like -O-CO-OCH2CH2COO-..., no, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a vinyl ester, like -CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that would include CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is directly attached to the ring, and there's a vinyl group elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: counting the hydrogens. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So the molecular formulas are either C11 or C12 with varying H counts.

Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X (halogens) or N mentioned, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For option A: C11H14O2.

DoU = (2*11 + 2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Which could be one ring (benzene, 3 DoU) plus two double bonds or rings. Hmm, but benzene is three DoU. So 5 DoU would be benzene (3) plus two more (like two double bonds or a double bond and a ring). But the structure is supposed to be a di-substituted aromatic ring, so maybe benzene plus an ester group which has a double bond.

Wait, but the ester group has a carbonyl (one double bond) and an ether linkage (which is a single bond). So that's one DoU from the carbonyl.

So the benzene (3) + ester (1) = 4. So the fifth DoU would be another double bond or ring. Where would that come from? Perhaps a vinyl group (another double bond). So DoU adds up: 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) = 5. That fits.

For option B: C12H14O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

So 6 DoU. Benzene (3) + ester carbonyl (1) + perhaps a ring or another double bond. Let's say a vinyl group (another double bond), so 3 + 1 + 2 (if there's another ring, but that's less likely). Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring with another ring or two double bonds.

But the structure in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so probably just benzene. So the other DoU could be a double bond elsewhere, like in a substituent. So yes, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 2 (maybe a double bond and another structure), but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Let me move on.

Let me think about the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has six signals. Let's see:

- Two aromatic protons: maybe two sets, each with a certain splitting. For example, in a di-substituted benzene, perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause two types of aromatic protons. For example, if substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), then the aromatic protons would be in two different environments. Alternatively, in the 1 and 3 positions (meta), which would have two sets. But how many signals would each produce? Let's say in the case of substituents at 1 and 3 positions (meta), the aromatic protons might split into two signals: one for the protons adjacent to substituent A, and another for those adjacent to substituent B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons could be in two sets, perhaps two doublets.

Now, the vinyl-H signals: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically split due to coupling with adjacent protons. For example, a CH₂=CH group would have protons that are split into a quartet and a triplet, but in this case, the problem says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, the substituent on the benzene is a group like -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3. No, that might have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -O-CO-CH₂CH₂COO something. No, that might have more carbons.

Wait, another thought: the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH₂-CO-OCH3. But then, the vinyl protons would be the CH₂ group, but that's a single bond, so vinyl implies a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group, like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but that's without a double bond. Wait, no, a vinyl ester would have a double bond. For example, -CH₂CH₂-CO-OCH3 would be an ethyl ester, but that's without a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps it's a propenoate ester, like -CH₂CH₂COOCH3. No, that's still a single bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH₂-COO-OCH3, but that's a single bond again.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the possible structure.

We have a di-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent must be such that it contributes to the NMR signals observed.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CO-O-R attached to the benzene, but that's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is connected to a vinyl group, like -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-O-R. Wait, but that's propylene glycol something, which doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R, but that's without a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group. Like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R, but that's single bonds again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, it's a group with a double bond, like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R with a double bond elsewhere, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R, but that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CO-O-R, which is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, but that's not a vinyl group.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the number of signals again. The NMR has six signals, which suggests that there are six distinct sets of protons.

- Two aromatic signals: perhaps two doublets.

- Two vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

- Two methyl signals: one as a singlet (like OCH3) and another as a singlet (like a CH3 attached to the ring? Or another group.

But wait, how can a methyl group attached to the ring have a singlet? If it's para to another substituent, maybe it's a singlet. But if it's meta, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl groups are in such environments that they don't split into multiplets, hence appearing as singlets. But the problem says two signals, so they must be separate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and a methyl group. So the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester (like O-CO-OCH3) and the other is a methyl group (-CH3).

In that case, the aromatic protons would split into two sets, perhaps two doublets. The ester's OCH3 would be a singlet, and the methyl group on the ring would be a singlet as well. But that's only four signals accounted for (aromatic: 2, OCH3:1, CH3:1). The NMR has six signals, so where are the other two?

Ah, wait, the vinyl protons come into play. So perhaps the substituent is not just a simple methyl group, but something with a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CO-OCH3. But that includes a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't have. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the ester group could be part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be a group like -O-CO-CH=CH2. In that case, the substituent would be an ester group attached to a vinyl group.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is -O-CO-CH=CH2, and the other is a methyl group (-CH3). But then, the CH=CH2 group would have two sets of vinyl protons.

Wait, the structure would look like this:

Benzene ring with substituents at two positions: one is O-CO-CH=CH2, and the other is CH3.

Now, let's break down the NMR signals:

- Aromatic protons: The substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two signals. Suppose substituents are at 1 and 3 positions (meta), leading to two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet.

- Vinyl protons: The CH=CH2 group. The CH2 would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. The CH would be split by the CH2. Let's say the CH=CH2 group: the protons on the CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the CH's proton), and the CH would be a triplet (coupled with the two protons on CH2). But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another way: the CH=CH2 group. The CH2 protons are at the end of the double bond. Each H on CH2 is adjacent to the CH, which has one H. So each H on CH2 would couple with the CH's H, leading to a doublet for each. But since the CH2 has two H's, they are equivalent, so their signal would be a doublet. The CH's H is adjacent to two H's on CH2, so it would be a triplet. But the problem states that one vinyl H is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH₂=CHCOOCH3. Wait, but that would have a propenoate ester. So the substituent would be -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3. But again, that's without a double bond. So the vinyl protons must come from somewhere else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structure again.

An alternative approach: since the ester is present, and the molecular formula options vary between C11 and C12, perhaps the substituent includes a group with two methyl groups.

Wait, let's say the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group. Then the ester might be something like O-CO-OCH3, which is a methyl ester.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3, and the other is CH3.

In that case, the aromatic protons would split into two groups, each as a doublet. The OCH3 would be a singlet, and the CH3 on the ring would be another singlet. But then, where do the vinyl protons come from? They're not present in this structure, which contradicts the NMR data. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester group, introducing the double bond and hence the vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CO-OCH3. But that would have a CH₂ group, which isn't allowed as per the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3, but that's getting too complex and includes CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH₂CH₂-OCH3. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is -O-CO-CH₂CH₂-X, but that doesn't include a double bond, so no vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -O-CO-CH₂CH₂COOCH3. No, that's too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CO-OCH3, but that's a single bond.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the number of protons each substituent contributes.

The molecular formula options are either C11 or C12.

If the structure is benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents. Let's say each substituent is a methyl group and an ester group.

So, a benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (ester: O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons: O, C, O, CH3. Wait, no, O-CO-OCH3 is two carbons (the COO and the CH3). So that's 2 C, plus the benzene's 6 C, making 8 C. But the options have 11 or 12 C. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are larger. Let's say each substituent is a group that adds more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which would be an ethyl ester. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-OCH(CH3)2, which is an isopropyl ester. But that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, which has a CH and two CH3 groups. But the NMR has only two CH3 signals, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-OCH3 and another group like -CH2CH2COOCH3, but again, that brings in CH2 groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula based on the options.

Let me calculate the number of hydrogens each option has.

Option D: C11H12O2. That would require a structure with 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygen.

Assuming it's a benzene ring (6 C), plus substituents. Let's say the substituents add 5 C and 6 H (since 6 C in benzene, 5 more C in substituents, total 11 C). But how? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. The ester group would contribute two oxygen and some carbons and hydrogens.

Let me think: benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (ester group: O-CO-OCH3: 2 C, 3 O? No, wait, O-CO-OCH3 is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 O in ester? No, ester is R-O-CO-R', so two O in the ester group.

Wait, the ester group would have the formula R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. For example, methyl ester would be O-CO-OCH3.

So, substituent 1: -O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 carbons (O, C, O, CH3? No, that's 2 carbons: the carbonyl C and the CH3. So substituent 1 is -O-CO-OCH3: that's 2 C (the O-CO-O- part contributes one C, and the OCH3 contributes another C). So substituent 1 is 2 C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a methyl group (-CH3), which is 1 C.

So benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (2 C) + substituent 2 (1 C) = 9 C. But the options have 11 or 12 C. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a larger group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is -CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which is an ethyl ester. But that brings in CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. So that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is -CO-OCH(CH3)2, which is an isopropyl ester. That would have 3 C in the ester group (COO plus isopropyl: 2 C in COO and 1 C in OCH(CH3)2? Wait, OCH(CH3)2 is one C (the oxygen is attached to the central C, which is connected to two CH3 groups). So substituent 1 is -CO-O-C(CH3)2, which is 3 C in the substituent.

So benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (maybe a methyl group, 1 C) = 10 C. Still not 11 or 12.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent includes a vinyl group and an ester group. Let's say substituent 1 is -CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), which is 2 C, and substituent 2 is -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but that includes CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester group, like -O-CO-CH=CH2. That substituent would have 4 C (O-CO-CH=CH2: 2 C in COO and 2 C in CH=CH2). So substituent 1 is 4 C.

Substituent 2: a methyl group (1 C).

So benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (4 C) + substituent 2 (1 C) = 11 C. That matches option D (C11H12O2) and option A (C11H14O2).

Now, let's count the hydrogens.

Substituent 1: -O-CO-CH=CH2. The CH=CH2 group has 2 C and 3 H (since it's CH₂=CH-). Wait, no: CH=CH₂ would have two CH₂ groups? No, CH₂=CH₂ would be ethylene, but that's not possible as a substituent on benzene. Wait, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂, but that's a single bond.

Wait, no, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-X? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but that's getting too long.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3, but that would have multiple CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH2CH2COOCH3, which is a propyl group, but that includes CH2 groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula again.

Let's take option D: C11H12O2.

The benzene ring has 6 C and 6 H.

Substituents: let's say two substituents. Each substituent contributes (11-6)=5 C, and (12-6)=6 H.

So substituent 1 and 2 together contribute 5 C and 6 H.

Wait, but that's not possible because each substituent would have at least one C. Maybe substituent 1 contributes 3 C and substituent 2 contributes 2 C. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester group with 3 C and substituent 2 is a methyl group (1 C). That would add up to 4 C, but 6 C from benzene plus 4 =10 C, not 11.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, which would have more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a group like -CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. So R could be CH₂=CH2, but that's ethylene, which has two C. So substituent 1 is -CO-O-CH₂-CH₂, but that's without a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let's think about a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Suppose substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-X, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH=CH2. So the substituent would be -O-CO-CH=CH2.

In that case, the substituent has a vinyl group (CH=CH2), which would have protons on the CH and CH2.

The CH=CH2 group would have two types of protons: the CH2 protons and the CH proton. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the CH, which is adjacent to the carbonyl group.

So the CH2 protons would be split by the CH proton, which has one H. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet. But since the two Hs on CH2 are equivalent, their signal would be a doublet. The CH proton is adjacent to two Hs on CH2, so it would be a triplet.

But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3. But that has CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-OCH3, but again, that's not a vinyl group.

I'm beginning to think that perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another substituent that's a vinyl group connected in a way that doesn't require CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but that includes CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CO-OCH3, but that includes a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a gem-dimethyl group attached to the ester. For example, substituent is -CO-O-C(CH3)2. So that's -CO-O-C(CH3)2. In this case, the substituent would contribute 4 carbons: the COO (2 C), and the C(CH3)2 (2 C). The hydrogens would be the two CH3 groups, which would appear as a singlet each, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. Wait, but a gem-dimethyl group would have two CH3 groups attached to the same C, so they would be equivalent and appear as a single signal. But the NMR has two CH3 signals, so that can't be the case.

Hmm. Let me try to think differently.

The NMR has six signals. Let's list them:

1. Aromatic H: two signals.

2. Vinyl H: two signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets).

3. CH3 groups: two signals.

So total of six signals.

Assuming the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents. Let's say substituent A is an ester group and substituent B is a group that contributes a vinyl group and two CH3 groups.

Wait, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=C(OOC)CH3, but that's a bit forced.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is -O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester) and substituent B is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that brings in CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl group connected to the ring, and the ester is another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2:

At position 1: -O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester).

At position 2: -CH₂=CHCOOCH3.

But that substituent would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. But again, CH2 groups are present.

This is really challenging. Let me think about the ester group. Since the ester is O-CO-O-R, perhaps R is a methyl group. So the ester is O-CO-OCH3. Then, the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

The other substituent could be a vinyl group, but without any CH2 groups. How?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3, but again, that's CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-COOCH3, but that's another CH2 group.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which molecular formula would make sense.

Option D: C11H12O2.

Assuming benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus two substituents. Let's say substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (2 C, 3 O, and 3 H from OCH3). Substituent 2 is a group that brings in 3 C and 3 H. Wait, 6 C (benzene) + 2 C (ester) +3 C (another group) = 11 C.

What group contributes 3 C and 3 H without any CH2 groups?

Perhaps a propyl group, but that would have CH2. Alternatively, a methyl group and another group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester. Like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3. But that brings in CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like -CO-OCH3 and a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group (-CH3, 1 C, 3 H). Then substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (2 C, 3 H), making total substituents 3 C, 6 H. Benzene (6 C, 6 H) + substituents (3 C, 6 H) = 9 C, 12 H. But the molecular formula is C11H12O2, so that doesn't add up.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 1 is a group with more carbons.

Wait, substituent 1 could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. But that has CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. That's too long and includes CH2 groups.

I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible molecular formula.

For option D: C11H12O2.

Assuming benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus substituents with 5 C and 6 H.

Substituent 1: 3 C, 3 H.

Substituent 2: 2 C, 3 H.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Let's say substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (2 C, 3 H) and substituent 2 is CH2=CHCOOCH3 (which is 4 C, 5 H). But that brings in CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CO-OCH3. That's 3 C, 3 H (CH2 group: 2 H, but that's a CH2, which is not allowed). So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group, and substituent 1 is a group with 4 C and 3 H. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH(CH3)2. That's an isopropyl ester. So substituent 1 is -CO-O-CH(CH3)2.

That substituent would contribute 4 C (COO is 2 C, CH(CH3)2 is 2 C) and 7 H (from COO: 2 O, no H; CH(CH3)2 has 2 CH3 groups, each with 3 H: total 6 H, and the central CH has 1 H). So substituent 1: 4 C, 7 H.

Substituent 2: maybe a methyl group (-CH3, 1 C, 3 H).

Benzene (6 C, 6 H) + substituent 1 (4 C,7 H) + substituent 2 (1 C,3 H) = 11 C, 16 H. But the molecular formula is C11H12O2, which would require 12 H. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. But that has CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct answer being option D: C11H12O2.

But why? Let's think about degrees of unsaturation.

Option D: C11H12O2.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

So 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Assuming benzene (3 DoU), ester (1 DoU from carbonyl), and the remaining 2 DoU could be from a double bond (like a vinyl group) and a ring (but we already have benzene). Alternatively, another double bond.

So structure-wise, it would be a benzene ring with an ester substituent and a vinyl substituent, plus any necessary groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-OCH3. But that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-COOCH3, but that has CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. But that's complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's anhydride, not ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's not right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that's an ether, not an ester.

I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should try to think of the structure as benzene with two ester substituents. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. But that's a carbonate, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, which is an ester.

But then, the structure would have a long chain, which would include CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The presence of an ester group and the absence of CH2 groups in the NMR suggests that the substituents do not include any methylene groups. So any substituent with a chain must not have CH2.

The vinyl protons suggest there's a double bond in the substituent.

So substituent must have a double bond but no CH2 groups.

A possible substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond but no CH2 groups. For example, substituent could be -CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Alternatively, -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that includes CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a longer chain and includes CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that's not a vinyl group.

I'm not getting it. Maybe the structure is benzene with a substituent that's a vinyl ester group, such as -O-CO-CH=CH2.

In that case, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH=CH2 (which is 4 C: O-CO-CH=CH2 has 4 C?), and substituent 2 is a methyl group (-CH3, 1 C).

So total C: 6 (benzene) +4 (substituent 1) +1 (substituent 2) =11 C. That matches option D (C11H12O2) and option A (C11H14O2).

Now, let's think about the hydrogens.

Substituent 1: -O-CO-CH=CH2.

The CH=CH2 group has 3 H (CH2=CH- has two H on CH2 and one H on CH).

Wait, no: CH=CH2 would have two H on CH2 and one H on CH. Wait, that's CH2=CH2, which is ethylene, but that's not possible as a substituent on benzene. Oh wait, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH₂. That's a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH₂-CH2, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that includes CH2 groups.

I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to make an educated guess.

Based on the NMR data and the presence of an ester, the structure likely includes a benzene ring with two substituents: an ester group and a methyl group, plus a vinyl group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, the molecular formula with 11 carbons and 12 hydrogens (option D) would have a degree of unsaturation that fits a benzene ring, an ester carbonyl, and a double bond (vinyl group). Thus, I think option D (C11H12O2) is the correct formula.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group is indicated by the characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Two aromatic-H signals**: This suggests a di-substituted benzene ring where the substituents create two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.
   - **Two vinyl-H signals**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group (C=C bond) with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Two -CH3 signals**: This implies the presence of two methyl groups in different environments, with no -CH2 groups detected in the spectrum.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - The options provided are **C11H12O2**, **C11H14O2**, **C12H12O2**, and **C12H14O2**.
   - The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each option is calculated as follows:
     - **C11H12O2**: DoU = 6 (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from a double bond or ring).
     - **C11H14O2**: DoU = 5 (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from a double bond or ring).
     - **C12H12O2**: DoU = 6 (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 from a double bond or ring).
     - **C12H14O2**: DoU = 5 (3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 1 from a double bond or ring).

4. **Structural Analysis**:
   - The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester group and another substituent that includes a vinyl group. The absence of -CH2 signals in the NMR indicates that any alkyl chains must avoid methylene groups.
   - The ester group contributes to the molecular formula as R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. The vinyl group adds a double bond, and the two -CH3 signals suggest the presence of two methyl groups in distinct environments.

5. **Matching the Formula**:
   - **C11H12O2** fits the data because:
     - It has 11 carbons, consistent with a benzene ring (6 C), an ester group (2 C), and a vinyl group (3 C).
     - It has 12 hydrogens, matching the aromatic protons, vinyl protons, and two methyl groups.
     - The degree of unsaturation (6) accounts for the benzene ring (3), the ester carbonyl (1), and the vinyl double bond (2).

Given the spectral data and the molecular formula analysis, the correct answer is **C11H12O2**.

Answer: D
