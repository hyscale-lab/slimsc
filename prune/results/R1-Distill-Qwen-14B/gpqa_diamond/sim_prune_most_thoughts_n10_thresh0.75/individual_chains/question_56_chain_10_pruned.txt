Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon, and dipole transitions are involved. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. So, the process must involve two steps, each a dipole transition.

First, I need to think about the selection rules for the hydrogen atom. Right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by any integer, but usually, the transitions are between adjacent energy levels for the simplest steps.

The initial state is |3,0,0>, so n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>. So, we're going from n=3 to n=1, which is a change of Δn = -2. That means it's a two-photon process, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so each step is a single photon emission.

So, the first transition must go from n=3, l=0 to somewhere else. Since l=0, the next possible l after a dipole transition would be l=1. Because Δl = ±1. So, the first step must change l from 0 to 1. So, the first state after transition would have l=1.

Wait, but n has to be lower. So, n=3 can go to n=2 or maybe n=1, but since l=1 for n=2 is possible. Let me think: for n=2, l can be 0, 1. So yes, 2p orbitals are possible. So the first step could be 3s → 2p. But wait, 2p has l=1.

So, the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Then, from |2,1,m>, the next transition would go to |1,0,0>, since l must decrease by 1 again (from 1 to 0), and n goes from 2 to 1.

So, the intermediate state has to have l=1 and n=2. So, the possible states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.

Now, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> must follow the selection rules. The dipole transition involves the matrix elements, which relate to the spherical harmonics Y_l^m. The transition probability depends on the overlap between the initial and final states, which involves integrals of Y_0^0 and Y_1^m.

Wait, the allowed transitions from l=0 to l=1. So, the possible m changes are Δm = 0, ±1. So, the initial state |3,0,0> can transition to |2,1,m> where m is -1, 0, +1.

But when considering the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, we have to make sure that l goes from 1 to 0. So, in that case, the selection rules again apply. So, what are the possible m transitions?

From l=1 to l=0, Δm can only be 0, because m for l=0 is 0, so the second transition must have Δm=0. So, the m value in the intermediate state must be 0, because from m=0 in the first transition, you can go to m=0 in the second. If the intermediate state had m=+1, then in the second transition, you'd have to go to m=0, so Δm = -1. Similarly, if the intermediate state had m=-1, then you'd have Δm=+1.

Wait, but the initial state is m=0, so the first transition could change m by +1, 0, or -1. Let me think about the possible intermediates.

Wait, but in the first transition, m can change by ±1 or 0. So, from m=0, after first transition, m can be -1, 0, or +1. Then, the second transition must take m from whatever it is to 0. So, for example:

If the first transition goes to m=+1, the second transition must go from m=+1 to m=0. That's a Δm = -1, which is allowed (since Δm can be ±1 or 0). Similarly, if the first transition took m=0, the second
