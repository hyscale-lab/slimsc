Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what each part is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. That gives product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to give the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the structures of each product and then count the distinct hydrogens in product 4.

Let me start by breaking down each step.

First reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups... Oh, this sounds like an elimination reaction. Dibromomethyl has two Br atoms; when combined with NaI, which is a good nucleophile, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But wait, the starting material is a diene. Oh, perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe a coupling reaction.

Wait, another thought: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. When NaI is present, maybe the dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution. Each Br is leaving, and iodide comes in. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2? No, wait, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. So when treated with NaI, which has I- as a nucleophile, perhaps it substitutes Br.

Wait, wait, but with two equivalents of the diene. So perhaps each diene molecule has two Br groups that get replaced by iodide.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination. If you have two equivalents, perhaps the diene is undergoing some coupling or forming a bridge.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1
