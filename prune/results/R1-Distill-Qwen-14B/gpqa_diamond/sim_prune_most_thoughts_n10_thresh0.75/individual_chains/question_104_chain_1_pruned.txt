Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but I'll try to piece it together.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that's good because circular orbits make calculations a bit simpler.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. So, when the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blueward (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift redward (longer wavelength). The periodic shifts indicate the star's movement due to the planet's gravity.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift. Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstrom. Wait, so the shift is larger for planet #2. I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards or away from us. The amplitude of this velocity (the wobble) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, among other factors.

Wait, let's get the formula right. I think the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (c * P^(1/3)) )

But wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should recall another version. Oh right, for planets where M_p is much less than M_*, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. The formula is K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. The RV method measures this velocity.

Wait, another formula I remember: K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 +
