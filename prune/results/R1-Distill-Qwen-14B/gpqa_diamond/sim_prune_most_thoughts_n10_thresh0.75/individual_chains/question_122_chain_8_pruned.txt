Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to understand each reaction step by step.

The starting material is acetic acid. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Bromine with pyridine might be some kind of substitution reaction. Wait, acetic acid has an -OH group. Oh, right, when you treat an alcohol with acetic anhydride and a base (like pyridine), it acetylates the hydroxyl group. So acetic acid (CH3COOH) would become acetylated. But wait, the reaction is with bromine as well. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the OH is replaced. Alternatively, bromine and pyridine could be part of a bromination reaction. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acetylation? No, wait. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, maybe the acetic acid is reacting with bromine in a different way.

Wait, acetic acid has the structure CH3COOH. When treated with bromine (maybe as a bromide), along with acetic anhydride and pyridine. Oh, another possibility: Maybe it's the formation of an acetylated bromide. Wait, let me think: pyridine is often used to absorb HBr as a base in such reactions. So perhaps the acetic acid is being brominated in the presence of acetic anhydride. So, maybe the -OH group is replaced by Br. That would form CH3COBr. Oh wait, acetic anhydride is (AcO)2O. So, perhaps the reaction is acetylation of the OH group, making the acetic acid into an acetate ester. Wait, but why would bromine be involved?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Acetic acid treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. Oh, wait, maybe it's a benzene ring scenario? Oh wait, no, acetic acid doesn't have a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the OH is replaced
