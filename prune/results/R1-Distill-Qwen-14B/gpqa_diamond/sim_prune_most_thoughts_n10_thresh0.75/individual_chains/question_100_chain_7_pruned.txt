Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. So, I'm thinking that's either propene or propane. Wait, but propane has the formula C3H8. Oh wait, no, wait, C3H6 is either propene (alkene) or cyclopropane. But given the reactions, I'm guessing it's an alkene because the first step is bromination in CCl4. Oh, right, alkenes undergo bromination via addition, while alkanes (like propane) would need a different condition, like substitution which CCl4 isn't typically used for. So compound A is probably propene, CH2=CH2CH3. Wait, wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? Or is it propene as in propylene, which is CH2=CHCH3.

So step one: Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4. That's an addition reaction. For propene, bromination adds across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Or wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the product would be either 1,2-dibromopropane or 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when Br2 adds to propene, it's a trans addition, but in this case, the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would lead to 1,2-dibromopropane, so CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. So when a dihalide (like 1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with KOH in an alcoholic solution, it typically undergoes elimination. So that's E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. So compound C would be propene again? Wait, wait
