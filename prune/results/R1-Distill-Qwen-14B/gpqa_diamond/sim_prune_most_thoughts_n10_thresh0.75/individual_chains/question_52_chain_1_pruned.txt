Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star's effective temperature and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, they can change the observed temperature because the spots are cooler. But the problem gives me some specific data, so I need to think about how that affects the ratio of these energy levels.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of these spots lowers the effective temperature.

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when no spots vs. when spots are present.

Wait, I remember that under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe extreme UV. Let me calculate the energy difference from this wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) 
Wait, let me compute that. 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18, so 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 = approximately 1.37e-18 J per photon.

But wait, to get the energy in terms of k*T, I need ΔE/(kT). Because in the Boltzmann factor, it's (ΔE)/(k T).

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So for each temperature, T, I can compute (ΔE)/(k T), then take the exponential of that, which will give me the ratio n1/n2.

Wait, wait, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for higher T, the exponential is bigger, so n1/n2 is larger. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher, and when it's cooler (with spots), the ratio is lower. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with this.

So, I need to compute the ratio of the ratios. That is, (n1/n2)_{no spots} / (n1/n2)_{spots} = exp[ (ΔE/(k T_spot)) - (ΔE/(k T_no_spots)) ) ].

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio when no spots is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and when spots R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), where T1 is 6000 K, T2
