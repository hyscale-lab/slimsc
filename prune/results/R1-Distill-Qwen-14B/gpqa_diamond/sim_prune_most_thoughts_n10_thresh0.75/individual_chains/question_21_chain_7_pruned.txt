Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements—like enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

Let's tackle part A first. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Tautomerism is the shift of a hydrogen atom and the associated electron density from one atom to another, resulting in the migration of a hydrogen. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or keto-enol type systems.

Benzoquinone—I think that's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Oh wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, it's O=C6H4-C=O, maybe? Alternatively, maybe para- or ortho-quinone. Either way, it has two ketones. Can it undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically requires adjacent H and double bonds. In quinones, the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the ring. If there are adjacent H's, maybe it can tautomerize. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the molecule is fully conjugated, so maybe it doesn't have protons adjacent to the carbonyl. Or wait, does it have alpha hydrogens?

No, wait. Benzoquinone, like para-benzoquinone, is O=C6H4-C=O. So the carbonyl groups are on opposite carbons of the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which are all sp² hybridized. So do they have hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Let me think: the carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen, and their adjacent carbons are each connected to two other benzene carbons and one hydrogen each. Wait, no, wait. In benzene, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen when it's a mono-substituted ring. But for quinone, it's a di-substituted ring. So in para-benzoquinone, the ring has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Each carbonyl is at a position where its adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens attached.

Wait, but in such a structure, can those hydrogens shift? Let's think: for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a double bond or carbonyl. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, maybe it can tautomerize. But wait, in the case of quinones, the structure is rigid due to conjugation. So perhaps they don't undergo tautomerism.
