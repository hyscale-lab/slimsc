Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, I've got a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let's see.

First, I'll read through the problem again to understand the reactions involved.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so that's A + 8B â†’ C. Bright red product... I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur? Or perhaps a transition metal compound? Wait, red often makes me think of things like Fe(OH)3, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal sulfide? No, I'm not sure yet. Let me hold that thought.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm. E is dangerous, so maybe something like a gas or a highly reactive compound. Wait, if C is reacting with D, which is a gas, perhaps D is a halogen? Or maybe it's something like O2 or Cl2?

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4; weak ones are like CH3COOH, HCN (wait, but HCN is strong). Wait, no, HCN is a weak acid? Or is it a strong acid? Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up. Wait, no, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is strong, HNO3 is strong. Acids like acetic acid are weak. So F is strong, G weak.

So C reacting with water gives back A, F, and G. So maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives a strong and a weak acid. Let me think about that. Maybe it's a salt of a weak base and a strong acid. For instance, NaNO2 and H2O might produce HNO2 and something else? Wait, no. Let's think about nitrates. If C is, say, a nitrate salt, like Cu(NO3)2, but when it reacts with
