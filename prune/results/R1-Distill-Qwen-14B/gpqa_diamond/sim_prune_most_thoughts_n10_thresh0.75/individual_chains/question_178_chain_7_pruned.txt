Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for determining renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have all terms with mass dimension ≤ 4, I think. So the interaction term's dimension should be checked.

Wait, the Lagrangian's terms must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So let's figure out the dimensions of each part in L_int.

First, let me write out what each symbol represents. ψ is a spinor field, like a Dirac field. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since F is antisymmetric. Oh wait, in QED, the interaction is eψ̄ γ^μ ψ A_mu, but here it's different. Here it's ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is antisymmetric in μ and ν, so that makes sense for F^{μν} being antisymmetric too.

Now, to find the mass dimension of κ. Let's look at each field's dimensions. 

In natural units (ħ = c = 1), the fields have certain mass dimensions. For a spinor field ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so the field must have mass dimension 3/2 to make the kinetic term (i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ) have dimension 4.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} in electromagnetism: each F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So F has the same dimension as ∂μ Aν. ∂ has dimension 1, and A is a gauge field, which has dimension 1 in 4D. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, let me confirm. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1 because the field strength F is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ), so F has dimension [∂] [A] = 1 * 1 = 2. Yes, that's right.

Now, let's consider each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0. Because the gamma matrices don't contribute to the mass dimension; they are just matrices.

ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

So, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimensions:

ψ̄ (3/2) + σ (0) + ψ (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then multiply by F^{μν}, which has dimension 2. So the term becomes 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the entire term is κ times [ψ̄ σ ψ F], so [κ] [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

So [κ] * 5 = 4 → [κ] =
