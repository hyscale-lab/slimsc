Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 vector. So the system is in a three-dimensional state space, probably a qutrit system or something similar.

The problem mentions two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as 3x3 matrices. The first thing I notice is that Q's matrix is diagonal. Diagonal matrices are usually easier to work with because their eigenvalues are just the diagonal elements.

The question is about measuring Q after P. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm, okay. So the process would involve measuring P first, then Q. But wait, in quantum mechanics, measuring a system affects its state. So after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, the state is in that eigenstate, so the probability of getting a particular value for Q will depend on the overlap between that eigenstate and the eigenstates of Q.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, let's write down the state vector. So the initial state is:

Ïˆ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Right, so it's a column vector with components -1, 2, 1.

Then
