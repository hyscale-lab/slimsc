Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's break it down.

The question talks about Substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B when heated. Also, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's another clue about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms.

Let me start by identifying each part.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y. I'm thinking maybe it's something like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals often react with acids to produce hydrogen gas, salts, etc. But the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, the gas molecule has equal neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Helium has 2 protons, but neutrons would need to be 2 too. So a helium atom would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, making He-4? But is helium a gas produced in such reactions? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: the gas W might be something like CO2 or H2O, but those don't fit the neutron and proton count. Let me think about other possibilities. Oh, maybe it's methane? No, that's CH4. Or perhaps something more like NH3? No, that's N with H. Wait, another angle: the molecule of gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Oh wait, no, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom?

Wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for the entire molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. So like, each molecule has p protons and p neutrons.

Let's think of possible molecules. Maybe H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and one O (8 protons). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons in O is 8 (since O is usually 16, 8 neutrons). So total neutrons in H2O molecule would be 2*(0, since H has no neutrons) +8=8. Wait, 10 vs 8. Doesn't match. So that's not it.

Another option: CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So two O's: 6 + 16 =22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + 16=22 neutrons. Oh wait, that's 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be CO2.

But wait, how would that happen in a reaction? If X is a metal reacting with an acid (like Y being H2SO4 or HCl), would that produce CO2? No, usually acids like H2SO4 would produce SO2 or something else, not CO2. Unless X is a carbonate or something else.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the gas is CH4? Let's see. CH4 has C (6 protons) and 4 H (1 each). So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons: C has 6 (assuming C-12), H has none. So total neutrons:6. 10 protons vs 6 neutrons—doesn't match. So not CH4.

Hmm, what about N2? Nitrogen has 7 protons each. So two N atoms: 14 protons. Neutrons: Each N-14 has 7, so 14 neutrons. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So gas W could be N2. But does the reaction produce N2 gas? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's H2? H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Could the gas be O2? O2 has 16 protons per O, so 32 protons in O2. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8, so 16 total. 32 vs 16—nope.

Alternatively, maybe CO? C has 6, O has 8. So 14 protons. Neutrons: C-12 (6) and O-16 (8) → 14
