Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere has spots, photometric observations show brightness variations as the star rotates. This setup can look like an exoplanet. The question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change as these spots?

Hmm, okay. So the key here is that when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip; it's the spots. So the problem is asking what planet size would mimic the same depth in the light curve.

Wait, but the spots are dark, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. The idea is that the change in brightness from the spots should be the same as the change from a planet blocking light. So I need to compare the brightness change caused by the planet (if it were blocking the star) to the brightness change caused by the spots.

But wait, the spots are on the star. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the brightness changes because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light. The problem is asking to find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve, so the dip would be the same.

Wait, but the star's brightness isn't just about the spots. The star's total brightness depends on its temperature and radius. But here, the star is the same as the Sun, so its radius is R_sun. But the spots have a lower temperature. Since the star is rotating, as the spots come into and out of view, the observed brightness changes.

Let me think about how the brightness change due to spots would work. The star emits a certain amount of light, but when spots are present, they're darker, so the total light is less. The amount of the decrease depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the star.

The problem says the filling factor is 20%. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by the spots. So 20% of the star's surface is covered. But wait, the star is being observed from Earth, and only one hemisphere is covered. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So during the rotation, the spots go from being visible to not, causing the brightness to dip and then rise again.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so its surface area is 4πR². The radius R is the same as the Sun, but let's confirm that.

So the star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The exoplanet's radius is Rpl, and we're to find Rpl
