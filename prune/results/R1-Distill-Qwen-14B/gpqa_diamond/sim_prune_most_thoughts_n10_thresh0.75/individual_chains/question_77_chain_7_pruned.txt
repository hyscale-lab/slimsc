Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm supposed to figure out the major products from two different reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and they undergo a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Right, so when a 1,5-diene is heated or exposed to light, it rearranges, right?

Looking at the first part of the question: the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me try to draw that structure. So benzene ring with a substituent, which is an oxygen connected to a methyl group, and that oxygen is also connected to another group. Wait, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let me break it down.

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CHCH2CH2, but wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is OCH2 connected to the benzene. The other end of the oxygen is connected to the butenyl group. So the butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the group attached to the benzene is OCH2-, and the oxygen is connected to the but-2-en-1-yl group, which is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. No, wait. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl means double bond between C2 and C3, and the substituent is at position 1. So position 1 is the end attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH
