Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm. So, I remember that the potential energy in a system of point charges is calculated by considering each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are the same, each pair will contribute the same amount, but I have to be careful about whether the charges are fixed or moving.

Wait, but in this problem, 12 charges are at a fixed distance from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 13th is at a fixed point, and the others are all at 2 meters away from it. So, the system consists of a central charge and a ring (I guess) of charges around it.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is at P.

So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs.

Wait, but in a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since each pair is considered once, I have to calculate this correctly.

So, each of the 12 charges at 2m from P contributes to the potential energy. The 13th charge is fixed, so maybe it's part of each pair. Let me think: the 13th at P is interacting with each of the 12 charges, each at 2m. So, each of those 12 charges will have an interaction with the 13th charge.

Additionally, the 12 charges are at 2m from P. Are they interacting with each other? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, which is the position of the 13th charge. So, do the 12 charges form a configuration where they are all at 2m from P, but perhaps arranged such that their mutual distances are larger than 2m? Or maybe they are all at the same point, but that's unlikely because then they'd be on top of each other, which would complicate the energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So P is a point, and the 12 are on a sphere (or a circle, since it's 2m in radius) around P. But it's in three dimensions, so they form a spherical arrangement. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary based on their positions on the sphere.

However, calculating the potential energy between all pairs might be complicated. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the charges arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Oh wait, but wait, no. The problem says it's an isolated system, but the charges are fixed in their positions except for the 13th. Wait no, the 13th is fixed at P, the others are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So all the other 12 are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

So, then, the only potential energy contributions are between the 13th charge and each of the 12 others, and between each pair of the 12 charges. But wait, calculating the potential between all pairs of the 12 would require knowing their arrangement. But since the 12 are fixed
