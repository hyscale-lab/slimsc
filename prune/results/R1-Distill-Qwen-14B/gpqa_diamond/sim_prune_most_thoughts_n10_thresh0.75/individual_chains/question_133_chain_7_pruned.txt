Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me read the problem again.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C. We're told the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.

Hmm, so orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form. Wait, but I remember that the phosphate buffer system can be a bit tricky. Let me think about the dissociation steps.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, so each unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-). So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So that's the orthophosphate ion. So how do we get PO4^3-? From the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the system is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and another buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-?

But wait, in reality, phosphate exists in various forms depending on the pH. The major species depend on the pH relative to the pKa values.

Wait, the pKa values can help determine the dominant species. Let me calculate the pKa values.

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 = log(1/(7.5e-3)) → approximately 2.12 (since 1e
