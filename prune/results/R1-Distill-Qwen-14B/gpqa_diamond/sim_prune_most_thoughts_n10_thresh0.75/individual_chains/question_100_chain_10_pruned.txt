Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Wait, that's propene or propane? Oh wait, propane would be C3H8, so A must be propene, which is an alkene. Propene has the structure CH₂=CH₂CH₃. Right.

So A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. So if A is propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, wait. No, wait. Propene is CH₂=CH₂CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so it's CH₂=CHCH3. When bromine adds across the double bond, the product should be 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂CH3? Oh wait, no, propene is CH₂CH₂CH3? No, no, wait. Propene is CH₂=CH₂CH3? No, wait, no. Let's correct that. Propene is CH₂=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add one Br to each carbon of the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH₂BrCHBrCH3. Because the addition would be anti, but the structure is more important here.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, an elimination reaction. But wait, B has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. So when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate HBr. Wait, but since there are two Br atoms, perhaps it can eliminate twice?

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would likely eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene again. Because when you have vicinal dihalides (halogens on adjacent carbons), elimination can occur twice. So the product C would be propene again? Wait, but wait. Let me think again.
