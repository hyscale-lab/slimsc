Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The problem says we have a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating, so it's radiating. The symmetry axis is along the z-axis. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle and how it depends on wavelength lambda and the angle theta measured from the z-axis.

The options give possible fractions of the maximum power A and the form of function f in terms of lambda. So I need to figure out what fraction of the maximum power is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and what the dependence of f on lambda is.

Wait, when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The dipole radiation is a common case. Oh right, the dipole antenna. The radiation pattern for a dipole is a function of theta, the angle from the axis.

The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the radiation pattern. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the formula P proportional to (sin theta)^2. Or wait, I think it's actually (sin theta)^2, which would peak at theta=90 degrees, but wait, that's the intensity pattern for a dipole. So the maximum intensity is at theta=90, but the problem here is about the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30.

Wait, the maximum power A is the total power radiated, right? Because the problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". Hmm, no, wait: in radiation, the power per unit solid angle is the function f. So A is the maximum value of f, perhaps? Or is A the total power? Hmm, the question says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So perhaps A is the total power, and the function f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles (4π steradians), but the maximum value of f is A? Or maybe A is the maximum value of f? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of lambda and theta. So f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f is A. So, if you integrate f over all solid angles, you get the total power emitted.

But the question is about the fraction of A that is radiated at theta = 30 degrees. Hmm, perhaps that's the value of f at theta=30, divided by A? Or the integral of f in a small solid angle around theta=30, but let's read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30^0". So when they say at theta=30 degrees, I think they mean the power per unit solid angle at that theta, divided by A. Because the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the fraction would be f(theta=30)/A.

But wait, A could be the maximum value of f. So f(theta=30) is the power per unit solid angle at that angle. The maximum value of
