Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. I remember that cycloadditions are pericyclic reactions, right? And [4+2] specifically is a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but wait, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] between a diene and a dienophile. But sometimes, other systems can also undergo similar reactions.

The question is asking me to identify the exo product of a reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. The options are A, B, C, D with various structures.

So, first, I need to figure out what the reactants are and what kind of cycloaddition they're undergoing. 2,5-dimethylthiophene is an electron-rich molecule because the sulfur is electron-donating, making the conjugated diene more reactive. Furan-2,5-dione, on the other hand, has two ketone groups. Furan is usually a good dienophile because the oxygen is electron-withdrawing, making it electron-deficient. Wait, but wait, furan-2,5-dione is a dione, so maybe it's even more activated as a dienophile because of the two electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, but wait another thing. The dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction is typically something like a carbonyl, like maleic anhydride, which is a good dienophile. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, so it's a good dienophile.

So, the reaction is between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (the diene) and furan-2,5-dione (the dienophile) under heat, which probably makes it a thermal Diels-Alder. But wait, Diels-Alder is typically a [4+2] between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, but thiophene is a five-membered ring, so how does it act? Oh wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a diene. Let me draw it: thiophene has a five-membered ring with sulfur. If it's 2,5-dimethyl, then the two methyl
