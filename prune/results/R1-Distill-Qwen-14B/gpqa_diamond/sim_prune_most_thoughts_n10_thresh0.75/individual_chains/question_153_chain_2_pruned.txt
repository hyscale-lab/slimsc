Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's break this down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I'll take them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH as the solvent. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it likely deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate is a nucleophile that attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is like a diester, right? Its structure is (CH3COO)2CH. So when deprotonated, the enolate would be at the central carbon. Then it would attack the β position of the acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Or wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CO-OCH3 attached to the p-tolyl group. No, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH2? No, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents are on the second carbon. Wait, maybe it's structured as CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but substituted at the 3 position. Wait, maybe the structure is more accurately: the acrylate is CH2=C
