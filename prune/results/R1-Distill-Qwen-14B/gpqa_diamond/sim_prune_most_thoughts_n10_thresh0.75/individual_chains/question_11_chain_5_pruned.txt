Okay, I need to find the incorrect statement about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. Let's go through each option step by step.

Option A: SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair. The N-terminal ExoN of nsp14 binds to nsp10, making an active exonuclease. I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 form a complex, which is involved in viral RNA proofreading. But wait, the ExoN domain is part of nsp14, and as a heterodimer, they function in RNA editing or repair. So A seems correct.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while Bcl-2 is intrinsic. If SARS-CoV-2 activates caspase-8 but doesn't change Bcl-2, it suggests extrinsic pathway. But wait, I think ORF3a might actually cause apoptosis through both pathways. Or maybe some studies show it affects Bcl-2. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Frameshifting rate correlates with pseudoknot conformations. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two pseudoknot conformations under tension, leading to similar frameshifting. From what I remember, frameshifting rates in coronaviruses are influenced by the structure, and pseudoknots do have multiple forms. So C might be correct.

Option D: Programmed frameshifting creates two polyproteins by shifting back one nucleotide using slippery sites and a pseudoknot. SARS-CoV-2's frameshifting is mostly same as SARS-CoV. I think the frameshifting mechanism is similar, so D could be correct.

Wait, but let's think again about the options. The question asks for the incorrect statement. 

Option B: ORF3a causing caspase-8 activation but not affecting Bcl-2. I recall that some coronaviruses induce apoptosis through both pathways. If ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2, then it's only extrinsic. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's not the case.

Another point: programmed frameshifting in D. I remember
