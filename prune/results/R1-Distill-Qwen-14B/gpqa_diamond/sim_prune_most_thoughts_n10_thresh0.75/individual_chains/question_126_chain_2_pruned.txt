Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. After both are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each will show.

First, let's break down Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. So when LAH is used on a ketone, it should reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But wait, I also remember that LAH can be used to reduce esters and ethers, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone with a methoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)3. So position 3 is the ketone. So structure: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2 something. Oh wait, hexan-3-one would be five carbons in a row, with the ketone on C3.

So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but here, it's 5-methoxy so on the fifth carbon, but wait, the chain is six carbons with the ketone on C3. So, positions: 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4,5,6. So 5-methoxy is on C5.

Wait, no. Let me count again. Hexan-3-one is 6 carbons with ketone on C3. So numbering from left: 1, 2, 3 (O), 4, 5, 6. So the substituents on the ketone are CH2CH2 and CH(OCH
