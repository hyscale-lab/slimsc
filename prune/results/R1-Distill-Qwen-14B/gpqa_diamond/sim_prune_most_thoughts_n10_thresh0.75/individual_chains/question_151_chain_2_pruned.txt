Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Alright, the state of a system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, matrices are usually square, but maybe it's a vector here. So the state vector is a column vector with three components: -1, 2, and 1. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized first.

Wait, the vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the vector isn't normalized. Oh, but maybe the state is given as a vector, and I can proceed without normalizing it because probabilities are calculated using the inner product with the eigenstates, which would take into account the normalization.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down P. The first row has (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is zero. Then find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue. Then calculate the inner product of the state vector with that eigenvector, square the absolute value, and that's the probability.

Wait, but how do I proceed? Let me think. So P is the matrix operator. To find the possible outcomes (eigenvalues) when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

So first, let me find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/sqrt(2)      0 ]
[1/sqrt(2) 0     1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0      1/sqrt(2)      0 ]

Hmm, this looks symmetric. So it's a Hermitian matrix, like an observable should be. So the eigenvalues are real.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

Let me write down the matrix P - λ I:

[ -λ       1/sqrt(2)       0 ]
[1/sqrt(2)  -λ        1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)      -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix needs to be zero.

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but perhaps I can find a pattern or find eigenvectors by inspection.

Alternatively, maybe this matrix has some symmetry that could help. Let me think about it.

Looking at the structure, maybe there are eigenvectors where all components are equal, or some other pattern
