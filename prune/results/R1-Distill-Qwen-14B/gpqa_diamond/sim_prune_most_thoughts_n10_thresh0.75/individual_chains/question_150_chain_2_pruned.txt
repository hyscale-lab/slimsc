Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR interpretation can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-0)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me recalculate:

The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, X is halogens, which we don't have here. So substituting:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a ring and a double bond or a triple bond, but more likely a ring plus some double bonds or maybe a couple rings. But looking at the NMR, let's see.

The NMR data is given as:
9.72 ppm (t, 1H) — that's a triplet. Triplet around 9.7, which is a high ppm. Maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually a singlet because there's only one proton. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enol or something. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Then 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) — doublet, two protons. Aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. Because if it's a doublet, maybe each is coupled to one adjacent proton. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is next to two others, but in a para-substituted ring, each H is adjacent to two others, so maybe two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with another part of the molecule.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) — another doublet, two protons. So maybe two sets of doublets in the aromatic region. That hints at two different aromatic rings or perhaps a substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but each doublet has two Hs. If the molecule has two aromatic rings, each with two substituents, maybe in para positions.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) — broad singlet, two protons. Broad signals usually come from exchange, like -OH protons, but this is 2H and a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other protons that are deshielded but not exchanging. Or perhaps it's an enol proton? Hmm, but enol protons are usually broad, yes. Or maybe it's some kind
