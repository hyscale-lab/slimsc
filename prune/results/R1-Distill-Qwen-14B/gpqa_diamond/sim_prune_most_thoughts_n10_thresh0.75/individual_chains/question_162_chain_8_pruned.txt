Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So, I need to figure out what kind of surface this is.

Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Or wait, maybe it's a space with hyperbolic geometry? I think that's right. So the metric probably corresponds to a hyperbolic space.

Normally, the metric for hyperbolic space in 2D can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. The standard Poincaré disk metric is something like ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but our given metric is different. Let me calculate the denominator here. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me compare this to the standard form.

Wait, the standard form I remember is (4/(1 - r²)^2) dr² + (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Or maybe in Cartesian coordinates, it would be something like [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). Wait, our metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y². So maybe they made a substitution. Let me think. If I let x' = x/2, y' = y/2, then 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (x')² - (y')²). So then the metric becomes [32/(4(1 - x'^2 - y'^2)))] (dx² + dy²). Wait, dx² = (2 dx')² = 4 dx'², same for dy. So substituting, we have [32/(4(1 - x'^2 - y'^2))] *4(dx'² + dy'²) = [32 *4/(4(...) ) ] (dx'^2 + dy'^2). Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) )= 32/(4 (1 - (x'^2 + y'^2)) ), where x' = x/2, y' = y/2. So substituting, the metric becomes 32/(4(1 - x'^2 - y'^2)) * (4 dx'² +4 dy'²) because dx = 2 dx', dy=2 dy'. So dx² + dy² = 4 dx'² + 4 dy'².

So putting it all together: [32/(4(1 - r'^2)))] *4 (dx'^2 + dy'^2), where r'^2 = x'^2 + y'^2. Let's compute the constants: 32 divided by 4 is 8, and multiplied by 4 gives 32. So it's [32/(1 - r'^2)] (dx'^2 + dy'^2). Hmm, that looks familiar. The standard Poincaré disk model has a metric of [4/(1 - r^2)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²) in polar coordinates, or in Cartesian it's [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). So in our case, the metric after substitution is [32/(1 - r'^2)] (dx'^2 + dy'^2). Comparing, 32 is 4 *8. So the denominator is (1 - r'^2), so perhaps the scaling is different. Maybe the radius of curvature is different.

Wait, the general form of the Poincaré disk metric is (4R²)/( (R² - x² - y²)^2 ) (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, no, I think the general metric is (4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another form of the metric is ds² = (R²)/( (R² - x² - y²)² ) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but that's 3D. For 2D, it's similar but without the dz. Wait, I think the standard hyperbolic metric in 2D is written as ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²) when using a certain scaling. Or maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K for a surface with metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy² is given by (using the formula which I can't remember exactly), but for a metric of the form ds² = A(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula involving the Laplacian of ln(A).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Because if it's a pseudosphere, it's a surface of constant negative curvature.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me denote the function as f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So f = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²). The Gaussian curvature K is -1/R², where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk has curvature K = -1/(R^2). But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K when the metric is conformally flat (like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²)) is K = - (1/(2 f^2)) [ (
