Okay, so I've got a multiple-choice question about an organic compound's structure based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's likely a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, especially the carbonyl (C=O) around 1740 cm^-1. So, ester is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's see what each part tells me.

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H: since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be ortho, meta, or para. If it's para, there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Wait, but wait, in para substitution, each H is equivalent, so there's only one peak for the ring Hs. Oh, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe it's an ortho substitution. Because in ortho, the two substituents are adjacent, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons. For example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 2, then the H's at 3 and 4 would be equivalent? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: in ortho-substituted benzene, the ring would have two distinct sets of H's. So for example, if the substituents are at 1 and 2, then the H at 3, 4, 5, and 6 would split into two sets. Wait, no, maybe they have two doublets. Because in ortho, the substituents are adjacent, leading to two different environments for the H's. So two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond or in an allylic position. So, perhaps there's an ester group attached with a vinyl group. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, actually, esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. Wait, maybe the compound has a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, the substituents on the benzene ring are an ester group and something else, perhaps a vinyl group.

Wait, the two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. That makes me think of a structure where the vinyl protons are adjacent to an ester group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like an allyl ester. Let me think: if the substituent is something like O-CO-O-R where R is a vinyl group. Or maybe it's an aryl group with a vinyl substituent attached as part of the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like where the ester is connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is an ester where the R group has a vinyl substituent. Let me think about the NMR shifts. So, vinyl protons are typically around 4-6 ppm, depending on the substitution. So in the NMR, we have two signals for vinyl-H, which suggests two different types of vinyl protons.

So, for example, in an allyl group, the protons adjacent to the double bond would couple with each other. If the group is something like CH2=CH-CO-O-... Then the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH parts. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, if there's a substituent like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, that wouldn't have vinyl-H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like CH2=CHCOO-. Then the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH of the CH2=CH- part. So the protons on the CH2 would be a doublet of quartets, and the CH would be a doublet. Because each CH2 proton is next to the CH, and the CH is next to the CH2. Wait, maybe the coupling is such that the two protons on the CH2 would split into a quartet, but that's if there's a neighboring group with two protons. Hmm, perhaps each proton on the CH2 is a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is attached to the benzene ring. Let me imagine a structure where the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group
