Alright, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about nucleon systems and particle emission. Okay, let me break it down step by step.

So, the problem states that we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I think I remember that for identical particles like nucleons, the total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange. Since they're fermions, the overall wavefunction (which is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts) must be antisymmetric. So the product of these parts' symmetries should be -1 under exchange.

The initial state is 1S0. From the term symbol, the 1S0 means (2S+1)LJ. So S here is the total spin. For 1S0, S must be 0 because (2*0 +1)=1, so the term is 1S0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. The first number is the multiplicity, which is 2S+1. So in 1S0, the multiplicity is 1, which implies S=0. So the total spin S for the NN system is 0. 

Now, the state before emission is 1S0. After emitting particle X, the NN state is in a new state with T(NN)=0. So the initial and final NN states must have specific properties.

I remember that the isospin (T) of the system affects the parity. The parity of the initial state is important because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So I need to consider parity conservation in the process.

Let me think about parity first. The initial parity is determined by the NN state. The initial state is 1S0, which has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0 (since the term is S0), so the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. 

When the NN system emits a particle X, the parity of the final state (NN) plus the parity of X should equal the initial parity. Wait, no, because parity is conserved, so the product of the parity of the initial state and the parity of X should equal the parity of the final state. Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Because when a particle is emitted, the interaction is a two-body process (NN → NN + X), so I think the parity of the initial state should equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X. Because each part's parity multiplies together.

So, initial parity = parity(final NN) × parity(X).

Initial parity is +1. X's parity is -1. So 1 = parity(final NN) × (-1). So parity(final NN) must be -1. Because (-1) × (-1) is +1, which matches the initial. Wait, no: 1 = [parity(final NN)] * [parity(X)].

So [parity(final NN)] = 1 / parity(X) = 1/(-1) = -1. So the parity of the final NN state must be -1.

Wait, no, let me recheck. When a particle is emitted, the parity of the initial state is the product of the parity of the final state (NN) and the parity of the emitted particle (X) because the process is a decay or emission. So, initial parity = (parity of final NN) × (parity of X). So 1 = (parity of final NN) × (-1). So parity(final NN) = -1.

So the final NN state must have parity (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number in the final state. So (-1)^L = -1 → L
