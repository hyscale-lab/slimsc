Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find out which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1,2,3. Wait, actually, in benzene numbering, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, substituents at 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, but the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Let me visualize that: o-substituted with ethoxy, next to that (m) is tert-butyl, and the third substituent is nitro.

Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the positions, if the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl is at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Wait, no. 1, 2, and 3 would be consecutive, so perhaps it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that their positions are 1,2,3, but depending on the order of substitution, the positions might vary. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 1, 2,
