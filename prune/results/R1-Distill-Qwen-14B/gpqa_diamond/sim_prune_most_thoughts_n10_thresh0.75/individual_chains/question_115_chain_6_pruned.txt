Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I need to find the angle between the directions of these photons.

First, let me recap what I know. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this involves conservation laws—probably conservation of momentum and energy. Since they annihilate into photons, and photons carry momentum and energy, I have to make sure that the total momentum and energy before and after the collision match.

Wait, but the particles are a positron and an electron. Positrons are the antimatter counterparts of electrons. So when they meet, they annihilate each other. The process would be e⁻ + e⁺ → γ + γ.

Right, so the initial setup: electron moving left to right (from the left) and positron moving right to left (from the right). Wait, no, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left (so going right, perhaps?), and the positron is moving from the right (so going left?), but wait, the problem says they are moving along the horizontal axis. Let me clarify the directions.

So, let me model this: the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions on the same line.

But wait, no, the wording says: electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is to the right. Positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so direction is to the left. So they are approaching each other along the same line.

Wait, but after they collide, they annihilate into two photons. And both photons have the same energy, but their directions are both to the right but one upper and one lower? Or perhaps in other quadrants? Wait, the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower
