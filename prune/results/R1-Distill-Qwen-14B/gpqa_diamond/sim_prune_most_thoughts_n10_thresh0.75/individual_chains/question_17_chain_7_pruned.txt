Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that we have a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. We need to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+], from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex because it favors the formation of the complex.

So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The reaction for the formation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The stability constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. But wait, what about the dissociation of the complex? Since the complex is formed, some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4− ions in solution.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. So, initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. But due to dissociation, some of this will break down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates as x. So, if x is the concentration of Ca²+ ions that come out, then the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, assuming that for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced.

Wait, no, that might not be entirely correct. Let me think again. The dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

So if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by x, then at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.
