Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let's think this through. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift of a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So the closer the star, the larger the parallax. Parallax decreases as the star is farther away.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I imagine a range of parallax values, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range on average?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Does that mean that their distances are spread out in a certain way? I think uniform distribution in the sky doesn't necessarily mean uniform in distance. Because if you look at a sphere around us, more stars might be at certain distances but perhaps the problem is considering a uniform distribution in terms of density.

Wait, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, but I'm not sure if that's in terms of physical space or on the celestial sphere. Oh wait, in reality, the distribution of stars isn't uniform in space, but in this problem, we're assuming it is. So perhaps it's implying that the number density of stars is uniform throughout the universe (or at least our observable part) as seen from Earth
