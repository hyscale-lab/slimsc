Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, especially involving light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the medium here is glass, which complicates things because in classical mechanics, the speed of light depends on the medium's velocity. However, according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames. But what about in a medium?

Wait, the glass is moving. So the glass is a medium through which light is propagating. The light's speed in the glass when the medium is stationary is c/n, since the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So when the medium is moving, does the speed of the light change as observed from the lab frame?

In classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the medium is moving at velocity v and the light is moving at (c/n) in the same direction as the medium's motion, then the speed of light would be (c/n + v) in the lab frame. But wait, that can't be right because of relativity. Oh wait, but waitâ€”relativity only directly applies to the vacuum. In a medium, the situation is different. So maybe in this problem, classical addition is expected.

But wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, that would be towards the observer as well. So the glass is moving towards the lab frame observer.

Wait, but if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, does that mean the light is moving faster than the glass? Or perhaps the light's velocity in the glass is c/n, and since the glass is moving, we have to add its velocity to the light's velocity in the glass.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving
