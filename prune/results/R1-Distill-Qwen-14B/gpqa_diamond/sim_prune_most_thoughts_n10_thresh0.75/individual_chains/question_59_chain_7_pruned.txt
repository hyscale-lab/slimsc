Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when mixing different solutions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is: I need to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions—500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are four different pH values, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what each of these substances does. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So this mixture is a combination of a weak acid and a strong base, which probably means it's a buffer solution. But wait, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out if there's excess acid or base after they react.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base in the solutions. Moles are calculated by multiplying molarity (M) by volume in liters.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate moles of CH3COOH:
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
   - Moles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

2. Moles of HCl:
   - Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
   - Moles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

3. Moles of Ba(OH)2:
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
   - Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.
   - Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH^- contributed by this is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Same with Ba(OH)2 as a strong base, it will dissociate completely as well.

So now, the HCl will provide H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 will provide OH- ions. But H+ and OH- can react. So I should think about the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH-.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So first, I should sum all the H+ and OH- in the solution before any reactions.

Wait, but wait, each component contributes H+ or OH-.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 moles because it only partially dissociates. Hmm, but
