Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the setup. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) and I need to determine which can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key points are the apparent V magnitudes each spectrograph can handle.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. But wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck: the text says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude number.

Wait, so for each spectrograph, it's the apparent V magnitude that matters. So for a star to be observable by a spectrograph, its apparent magnitude must be brighter than (i.e., lower than) the threshold. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V <17 can be observed. For HIRES, V <16 can be observed.

So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So, a star that is brighter than V=16 (so V ≤16) would be observable by both, right? Because 16 is less than 17. So any star with V <16 can be seen by both. But if a star is between V=16 and V=17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, no wait: The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So V <17. Similarly, "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES: V <16.

So a star must have
