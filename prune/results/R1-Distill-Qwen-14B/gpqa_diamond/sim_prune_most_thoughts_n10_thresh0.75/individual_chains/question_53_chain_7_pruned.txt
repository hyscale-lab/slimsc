Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The question provides some spectroscopic data, and I need to figure out the molecular formula from the given options. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means the compound has an ester functional group. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. That's good to note.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's dissect each part. Two signals are for aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern will determine the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of two each, giving two signals. But wait, the question says two signals, so maybe the substituents are in such a way that it causes two distinct environments for the aromatic Hs. So perhaps ortho, meta, or para substitution. Wait, for a di-substituted benzene, the possible splitting is:

- Ortho: two sets, each with two Hs. So two doublets, maybe?

Wait, no, ortho would have more complex splitting. Let me think. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), then the aromatic ring would have two equivalent Hs across from each other and two more sets? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, maybe it's para substitution. Because in para, the two substituents are opposite each other, and the aromatic protons would split into two sets: two Hs in one position and two in another, each as a doublet. Wait, but wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite, so the ring might have two equivalent Hs in each meta position. No, wait, maybe it's actually two substituents in positions that lead to two distinct sets of aromatic Hs. But I'm not sure yet. Let's move on.

Next part of the NMR: two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are typically on double bonds, like in an ester group. Wait, esters usually have carbonyl groups and an oxygen, but the vinyl part might be from an allyl group or something else. Oh wait, maybe the substituent on the benzene ring is an ester group attached via a vinyl group. Like, perhaps an ester with a vinyl group attached, such as an allyl ester or something similar. Alternatively, the substituent could be an ester with a vinyl substituent.

Wait, if the substituent is, say, an ester group connected via a double bond, like an acrylate or something. Let me think about the structure. If the benzene ring has two substituents, and one of them is an ester group. Let's imagine substituent A is an ester, like O-CO-O or something. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, perhaps
