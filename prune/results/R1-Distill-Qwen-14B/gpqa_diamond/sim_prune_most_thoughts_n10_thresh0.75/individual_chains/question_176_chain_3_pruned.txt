Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. I remember that when dealing with observables and measurements, the key concepts involve eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and how measurements affect the state of the system. 

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but wait a second—those are just the components, right? But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So I think I need to normalize this vector first. Oh wait, or maybe it's already a normalized vector? Let me check. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which is around 2.449. So the state vector is not normalized. So to find the actual state, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Let me note that down.

Now, the problem involves two observables, P and Q. The operators are given as matrices. So, to find the probabilities, I think I should first find the possible outcomes and corresponding eigenvectors for each operator.

The question is about measuring P first, getting outcome 0, and then measuring Q, getting outcome -1. We need the probability of both happening in sequence.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state collapses after each measurement. So the way this works is: first, you measure P. If the outcome is 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, you measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1. The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the steps are: the initial state is |ψ⟩. The probability of getting outcome p when measuring P is the sum over all eigenstates of P for that value. Then, upon getting p=0, the state becomes the corresponding eigenstate. Then, the probability of getting q=-1 when measuring Q on that eigenstate is calculated.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the probability that, when measuring P and then Q in this order,
