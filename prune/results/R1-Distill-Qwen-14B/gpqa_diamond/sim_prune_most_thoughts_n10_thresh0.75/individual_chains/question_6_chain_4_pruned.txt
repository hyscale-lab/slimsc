Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that potentials in quantum mechanics often lead to energy levels that depend on the particle's quantum numbers.

Wait, so the potential is in polar coordinates because it's given as a function of r and θ. That suggests I should be looking at the radial and angular parts of the wavefunction. But what's the form of this potential? Let me expand it a bit. The first term is (1/2) kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta... I think that can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me calculate that. The first part is (1/2) kr². The second part becomes (3/2) kr² * (1/2) + (3/2) kr² cos2θ*(1/2). Wait, no, better to compute correctly: 3/2 multiplied by (1 + cos2θ)/2. That's (3/2)*(1/2) kr² + (3/2)*(cos2θ/2) kr². So that's (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So the entire potential is (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Wait, 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4 kr², plus (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So the potential is V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate. The original V is ½ kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So expand the cos²θ part: (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/(2*2)) kr² (1 + cos2θ) → 3/(4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So that's (3/4) kr² * 1 plus (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Then adding the first term, ½ kr² is (2/4) kr². So total becomes (2/4 +3/4) kr² = 5/4 kr², plus (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Hmm, but that doesn't look familiar. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it as V(r,θ)
