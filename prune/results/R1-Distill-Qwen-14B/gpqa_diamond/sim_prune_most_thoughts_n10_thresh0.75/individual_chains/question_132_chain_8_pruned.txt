Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Wait, C10H14... Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2 =4. That gives four degrees, which could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or a ring plus some substituents. But since both are aromatic, they probably have a benzene ring each, but wait, wait, each compound is C10H14. Oh wait, no, each compound is C10H14, right? Because the mixture is two compounds each with that formula?

Wait, no. Wait, the mixture is a 1:1 of two aromatic compounds, each with the formula C10H14. So each is a monosubstituted benzene or maybe disubstituted but with certain substituents.

Looking at the options, all the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H12, because each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyl groups add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. Benzene is C6H6, so 6+4=10 carbons? Wait, wait: 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H10. Because benzene is 6 carbons, two ethyl groups are 2*(2 carbons) =4, so 6+4=10? No, wait, 6 (benzene) + 2*(2 carbons each) = 6+4=10? Oh wait, wait, wait. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5, but
