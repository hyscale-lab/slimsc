Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's read it carefully. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Alright, I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but I need to think through the setup.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that; it's purely about potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Wait, so these 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is a central charge with 12 others arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, but wait, the system's energy would be the sum of the potential energies between all pairs. Since the system is isolated, we're looking for the total potential energy.

But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and add them all up.

Wait, but let's think: the 13th charge is fixed at P. So it's one charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. So the potential energy contributed
