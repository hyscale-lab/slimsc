Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X.

Alright, so the given values are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. I remember that decay distance relates to the lifetime of the particle and how fast it's moving.

Wait, right! The mean decay distance is given by the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (βc). So the formula I think is L = βγ c τ. Or wait, another way to write it is that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ/(Γ), because Γ is the total decay width. Oh right, because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty principle connects that to the lifetime.

So first, I'll need to find the lifetime τ. Since Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Wait, but I need to convert Γ into energy units in the same system as Planck's constant. Let me think about the units. The width Γ is in GeV, and Planck's constant ħ is in units of GeV·s when using natural units where c=1.

Wait, to calculate τ, I can use τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should check the units. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, Γ is in GeV, so τ will be in seconds.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait wait, let me compute that. Let's do 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. Then multiplied by 1e-25, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Oh wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Since it's moving at a relativistic speed, I should calculate its beta (β) and gamma (γ) factors. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is
