Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

First, I need to understand what each of the given values represents. The question mentions [X/Y] notation, which I think is the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun. The formula I remember is [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X^sun/N_Y^sun). Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log(N_X/N_Y) - log(N_X^sun/N_Y^sun) = log(N_X/N_Y) - [X/Y]_sun. But I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, no, more accurately, the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, scaled relative to the Sun. The formula is [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) = log10( (N_X / N_Y) / (N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) )) = log10( (N_X / N_X_sun) / (N_Y / N_Y_sun) ) = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ). So if [X/Y] is positive, it means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Given that, let me list out the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

We're also given the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Wait, wait. The Sun's values are given as 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals certain values. So for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH_sun) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH_sun) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH_sun) =7 → log10(nMg/nH_sun) =7-12=-5 → nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5).

Our goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2: (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Or wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's Star_1's silicon divided by Star_2's silicon.

So how to get nSi for each star?

I think we can use the given abundance ratios to express [Si/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Mg/Si], [Mg/H], and use the Sun's compositions to find the ratios of the elements in each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → log10( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)/(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )= 10^0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = 0 → log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )= 0 → nFe/nH = nFe_sun /nH_sun → because 10^0=1.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), as we found earlier. So Star_1's nFe/nH is also 10^(-4.5). Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning same as the Sun.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So the ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun.

But how do we get nSi_1?

Let me think. For Star_1, we can use the [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So:

nSi_1 / nFe_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → because [Si/Fe] = log (nSi/nFe / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) ) = 0.3 → so (nSi/nFe) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

We know nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → so nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but I'm more interested in nSi_1. Because I need to find nSi_1 / nSi_2.

So let me express nSi_1 in terms of nH_1.

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3 → substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → The nFe_sun terms cancel out.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

But nSi_sun /nH_sun is the solar ratio. Let me compute that. From the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nSi/nH) = ?

Wait, the Sun's data: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Wait, the question doesn't provide it directly. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh wait, maybe I can get it from [Mg/Si] for Star_2 or something? Wait, no, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3.

Wait, the problem doesn't give us the solar [Mg/Si] value. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the solar [Mg/Si] because we have the Sun's nMg/nH and nFe/nH, but not nSi/nH.

Wait, maybe the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given indirectly. Let me think. Because for the Sun, if I can find nMg/nSi, that would help. From the Sun's nMg/nH and nFe/nH, but without knowing nSi, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] ratio. Let me see.

In the Sun, log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

We don't have nSi, but perhaps we can get it via another relation. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Mg/Si] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe], but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps for each star, express the abundance ratios in terms of [X/H], since [X/H] is the abundance of X relative to H compared to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → which we've already established.

But for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3 → so [Si/H] would be [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] → but wait, no, because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]. Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = [X/H] - [Y/H].

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of [X/H], which is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which is log(nFe_1 /nH_1 ) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun), because nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

So substituting into nSi_1:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → substituting nFe_1: (nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH_1) ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 → nFe_sun cancels.

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, the ratio [X/H] for Si in Star_1 is [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3=0.3. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1= (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^0.3 → So nSi_1= (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^0.3 *nH_1.

Which matches the earlier result.

So for Star_1, nSi_1 = (nSi_sun * nH_1) /nH_sun * 10^0.3.

Now, for Star_2, let's look at its parameters.

Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3 → (nMg/nSi)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =10^0.3 → nMg/nSi = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H] =0 → log(nMg/nH) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nMg/nH = nMg_sun/nH_sun → so nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

We need to find nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Let me see. From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, which gives nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2.

So substituting into nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH_2 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 * nMg_sun ) / (nH_sun * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) * (1/10^0.3 )

nMg_sun cancels out:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) * 10^(-0.3).

So nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) *10^(-0.3).

Now, we can write the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 as:

(nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)* 10^(-0.3) )

Simplify:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1/nH_sun ) / (nH_2/nH_sun ) * (10^0.3 /10^(-0.3) )

The nH_sun cancels:

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

Wait, but what is nH_1 and nH_2? Oh, wait, the question says "the elemental abundances of these two stars" assuming LTE and using EW method. So I think the H abundance is already considered, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Wait, but since we're looking for the ratio of Si atoms, perhaps the ratio of H in each star doesn't matter. Because in the expression for nSi_1 and nSi_2, the H terms (nH_1 and nH_2) are part of each star's own H abundance. But wait, if we're considering the photosphere, I think the H density is a factor of the star's overall composition, but perhaps in the ratio nH_1/nH_2, we need to relate it to their masses or something else.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. So perhaps the mass isn't directly relevant here, unless we're considering the overall scale of the photosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the abundance ratios are independent of the star's mass, as we're only given abundance ratios relative to H and Fe.

Wait, but I think I might be on the wrong track. Let me think again.

In the expression nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

But nH_1 and nH_2 are the number densities of hydrogen in each star. However, without knowing the actual number of Hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere, we can't determine this ratio. Hmm, but the question only gives us abundance ratios and the Sun's composition. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Wait, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen abundance [H/Fe] is the same as the Sun's for both stars, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same for both stars, but that's not given either.

Wait, but looking back, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, which implies [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → but to find nH_1, I'd need to know the actual number of H atoms, which I don't have. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, but maybe the ratio of H in the two stars is 1, meaning nH_1 =nH_2. But that can't be correct because the stars have different masses. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H density ratio is 1, so nH_1 /nH_2 =1.

Wait, but I don't think that's correct because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's density might not necessarily be the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H term because it's the same in both stars, but I don't think that's valid. Alternatively, maybe the H density cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, wait, let me see. Our expression is nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

But to find the ratio, I need to find (nH_1 /nH_2 ). Hmm. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the ratio [X/H] for each element in each star can be used to find the abundance.

Wait, another approach: Let's express the ratio of silicon in each star in terms of their [X/H] abundances.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3 = 0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 can be determined. Wait, how?

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is given as 0 → so 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So now, the [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3, and for Star_2 it's -0.3.

The [X/H] is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) → which is log( (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) ) → so [X/H] = log( (nX_star /nH_star) / (nX_sun /nH_sun) )

But to find the ratio of nSi_1 /nSi_2, perhaps I can write:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1) / ( (nSi_2/nH_2 ) *nH_2 ) ) → nSi_1/nH_1 * nH_2 / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) )

But let me think in terms of [X/H]:

nSi_1/nH_1 = (10^([Si/H]_1 )) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^[Si/H]_1.

Similarly, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^[Si/H]_2.

So, nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nH_1.

nSi_2= (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3 ) *nH_2.

The ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (10^0.3 nH_1 ) / (10^-0.3 nH_2 ) ) ] * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → the (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) terms cancel.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) → which is 10^(0.3 +0.3) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) → 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

So, same as before: nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Now, the problem is what is nH_1/nH_2? Because I don't have any data on the H abundance in each star. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but that's not given. Hmm.

Wait, but wait—since the problem doesn't give any other data about H, perhaps the H abundance is considered the same in both, and nH_1/nH_2 =1.

But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to realize that the H abundance doesn't affect the ratio because it's a common factor. Wait, but in our earlier expression, it's (nH_1 /nH_2 ), which, if it's 1, would make the ratio 10^0.6 *1 = around 3.98, which is approximately 4. Looking at the options, Option A is ~3.9. So maybe the answer is A.

But why would nH_1/nH_2 be 1? Because the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's assumed that the H density is the same in both stars, but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies that Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 implies Star_2 has the same Mg/H as the Sun.

But for H, we don't have any [H/Fe] or [H/X] values except through the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But to find nH_1 and nH_2, perhaps we can find the ratio nH_1/nH_2 using the fact that the mass of the star is given. But I'm not sure. The mass is given as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but how does that relate to the number of H atoms in the photosphere? Probably not a direct way, since the photosphere's composition could vary.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. But perhaps the photosphere's H density is the same for both stars, but that's not a given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that all the abundance ratios are given relative to H, and that the H density is the same for both stars. But without that info, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to find the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For each star, compute the [Si/H] abundance.

We've already found [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

The [X/H] is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX_sun/nH_sun) → so for each star,

nX/nH = (nX_sun/nH_sun) *10^[X/H]_star.

So for Star_1, nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

For Star_2, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^-0.3.

The ratio of nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1 * nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 *nH_2 ) → (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2) * (nH_1/nH_2) → [ (10^0.3 /10^-0.3 ) ] * (nH_1/nH_2 ) → 10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

So again, same expression.

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, I can't compute the ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H densities are the same, so nH_1/nH_2 =1. That would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to ignore the H terms and just take the ratio from [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

But that would be incorrect because the ratio would depend on both [Si/H] and the H densities.

Wait, let me think again: [Si/H] is a logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun. So if [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2= -0.3, then the ratio of their silicon abundances would be 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) =10^0.6 ≈3.98. So that's about 4. So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is ~4, which is option A.

But wait, that's only true if the H density is the same in both stars. Because if nH_1 and nH_2 are different, then the ratio would change.

But the problem doesn't provide any data about the H density in each star, so perhaps the assumption is that H is the same, or that the ratio is based solely on the [Si/H] values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to consider the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen, and then the ratio would be 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) =10^0.6, ignoring the H terms. So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between the logarithmic abundance ratios ([X/Y]) and the number densities of elements.

### Key Data and Relationships:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) = 0.3 \)
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) = 0 \), implying \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}}) = 0.3 \).
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) = 0 \), implying \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

4. **[X/H] Definition**:
   - \( [X/H] = \log_{10}(n_{\text{X}}/n_{\text{H}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{X,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- From [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 and [Fe/H]₁ = 0:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}) = 0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}})
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} = (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Thus, \( [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 \).

#### Star_2:
- From [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 and [Mg/H]₂ = 0:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) = 0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}})
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} = (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]
  Thus, \( [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
- The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
  \]
  Assuming the hydrogen density ratio \( n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \) (as no other information is provided), the ratio simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
  \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
