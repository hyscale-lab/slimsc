Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that radial velocity (RV) detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right?

Wait, the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. So the planets' masses are about the same, but their orbital periods are different based on the RV measurements.

The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K involves several factors, including the planet's mass, the orbital period, the inclination of the orbit, and the distance between the star and planet. But since the orbits are circular, I think inclination might be 90 degrees, making sin(i) equal to 1, so it's easier.

Let me think about the formula. I recall that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * ( (sin i) / ( (a (1 - e²) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a simplified version. Oh right, when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which it is here (Neptune is much less than the Sun), the formula simplifies. So K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing up the exponents.

Wait, I think the correct simplified formula for K when M_p << M_star is:

K ≈ [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( (sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 day) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to get the right formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate K as:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But in our case, both planets have similar masses, and the stars have the same mass. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so sqrt(1-e²) = 1. So the formula simplifies further.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no. Wait, let's make it more precise. Let's write the formula step by step.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1 / (2 * pi * c)) ) * ( (2 * pi) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember it's:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) * ( (P /
