Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin state of an electron can be represented as a two-component vector. So the state (3i, 4) must be a column vector. Let me write that down: it would be a vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. So, χ = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector again. The formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ. 

But wait, what's σ_y? Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix. From the question, it's given as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Right, so the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/2) ℏ times the expectation value of σ_y, because S = (ℏ/2) σ for spin-½ particles. But wait, no, wait—the S_y operator is (ℏ/2) σ_y, so when calculating the expectation value, we need to compute (ℏ/2) times the expectation of σ_y.

So let me write that out. The expectation value of σ_y is χ† σ_y χ, and then multiply by (ℏ/2) to get ⟨S_y⟩.

So first, I need to compute χ†, the conjugate transpose of χ. The state χ is [3i; 4], so the conjugate is [-3i, 4], and the transpose makes it a row vector: χ† = [-3i, 4].

Now multiply χ† by σ_y. Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, and χ† is a 1x2 row vector, so their product will be a 1x2 vector.

Let me compute each element:

First element: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i → 4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now multiply this by χ, which is [3i; 4]. So it's a 1x2 multiplied by 2x1, resulting in a scalar.

So the product is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4).

Let me compute each term:

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i². i² is -1, so this is 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3)*4 = -12.

Adding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24. Now, since S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ℏ/2) * (-24).

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the multiplication steps.

Wait, when I calculated χ† σ_y, let me go through that again.

χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y is [[0, -i],
          [i, 0]]

So, the product χ† σ_y would be:

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) → 0 + 4i → 4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 → (3i^2) +0 → 3*(-1) = -3. Right.

So χ† σ_y = [4i, -3]. 

Then, when multiplied by χ (which is [3i; 4]), the terms are:

4i * 3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 * 4 = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24. That's correct.

So the expectation of σ_y is -24.

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12ℏ/25. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, no, I think I missed a step. Oh! Wait a second. Oh no, no, perhaps the state vector is not normalized. Because the state is given as (3i,4), which might not be normalized. So I think I should normalize it before computing the expectation value.

Wait, normalization. The state vector must have a norm of 1. So the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

So the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). 

Oh! I totally forgot about normalizing the state. That's probably where I went wrong. So I can't proceed without normalization.

So the correct state vector is χ_normalized = [3i/5; 4/5].

So χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, recalculate χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute each step again with the normalized state.

σ_y is same as before.

Compute χ† σ_y:

First element: (-3i/5) *0 + (4/5)*i → 0 + (4i/5) → 4i/5.

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 → (3i²)/5 + 0 → 3*(-1)/5 → -3/5.

So χ† σ_y is [4i/5, -3/5].

Now multiply this by χ, which is [3i/5; 4/5].

So:

(4i/5) * (3i/5) + (-3/5) * (4/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (4i)(3i)/(5*5) )= 12 i² /25 → 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (-3)(4)/(5*5) = -12/25.

Sum: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So the expectation of σ_y is (-24)/25.

Now, ⟨S_y⟩ is (ℏ/2) times this, so:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ℏ) /50 = (-12 ℏ)/25.

So the expectation value is -12ℏ/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12ℏ/25. So the correct answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm squared of the state is \( |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \). Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Conjugate transpose of the state**:  
   The conjugate transpose of the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Matrix multiplication**:  
   The Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix is:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \):  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Final expectation value calculation**:  
   Multiply \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \) by \( \chi \):  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   - First term: \( \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{-12}{25} \).  
   - Second term: \( -\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{-12}{25} \).  
   Sum:  
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \frac{-12}{25} + \frac{-12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Expectation value of \( S_y \)**:  
   Since \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), the expectation value is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{-24}{25} \right) = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
