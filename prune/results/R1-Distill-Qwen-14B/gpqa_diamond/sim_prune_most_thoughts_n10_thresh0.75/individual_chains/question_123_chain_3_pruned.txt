Okay, so I just came across this physics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a supernova in our galaxy. Part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that we're dealing with two different reference frames: the galaxy's frame (let's call it frame S) and the ejecta's frame (frame S'). The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at some speed. But wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, how does that translate to the galaxy's frame?

Wait a second, in special relativity, velocities in different frames are related by the velocity addition formula. Since both are inertial frames, we need to consider relative velocity.

But wait, maybe it's a straightforward velocity. If the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame would be the negative of that, right? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy (which is stationary in its own frame), so the ejecta's speed would be 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but that might be the case if the velocities are non-relativistic. Because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate that. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is exactly 1/5th of the speed of light. So that's 0.2c, which is pretty significant. So we probably need to use special relativity here.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation and revolution of the galaxy. So it's a simple inertial motion problem.

So, the scenario is
