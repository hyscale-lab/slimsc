Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question is about a reaction where a specific compound is treated with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. The researcher uses TLC and sees that the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots have appeared. The options are potential products, and I need to determine which one is correct.

Hmm. So first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize what's going on. Let me imagine the molecule. The main part is benzene with an ether group attached. The ether group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. Breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH-? Wait no, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's impossible because but has four carbons. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would actually be CH2CH=CHCH2- but wait, wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Wait a minute, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but that's not possible because but has only four carbons. So positions can't be beyond that. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. Wait, no, the substituent is the but-3-en-1-yl group. So the substituent is (but-3-en-1-yl)oxy attached to benzene. So the substituent is:

The group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but the numbering is from the end where the substituent is attached. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is:

It's 1-yl, so the substituent is on the first carbon. But the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, but is only four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? That can't be because that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible as a double bond must be between two adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the substituent is a butenyl group with substituents. Let's break it down.

But-3-en-1-yl: the chain is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of substituents. The substituent is:

The group is but-3-en-1-yl, which would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl. No, I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2O- attached to the benzene. But wait, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. Oh right, so the substituent has a double bond and two methyl groups on the second carbon.

So the structure is: O-Bz (benzene) attached to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on the second carbon.

So the substituent is:

CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, because it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

The substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's impossible because you can't have a double bond beyond C3 in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, maybe it's:

The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-... No, no, let me think again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy.

So the substituent is a four-carbon chain (but), with a double bond starting at C3 (but-3-en). So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2O-? No, wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the chain is:

1      2      3      4
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's impossible because you can't have a double bond between C3 and C4 in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, but maybe it's 1-yl, meaning the substituent is attached to the first carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at C2-C3. No, wait no. I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

But-3-en-1-yl: so the substituent is attached to carbon 1 of but-3-ene. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Or maybe CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because that would be beyond the chain. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but then that's but-1-en-4-yl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about but-3-en-1-yl as having the substituent (the ether oxygen) attached to C1 of a four-carbon chain where the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because in a four-carbon chain, the double bond can be between C1-C2 (but-1-ene) or C2-C3 (but-2-ene). So maybe I'm making a mistake here, because but-3-en-1-yl would imply a five-carbon chain, which contradicts. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (but-1-en-3-yl?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, but the butenyl group has a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because but has four carbons. So perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbon. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to move forward with the reaction. The reaction is with HBr. HBr typically acts as an acid, but in this case, perhaps it's undergoing an addition reaction. The substituent is an allyl ether, which I think can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage, such as the acid-catalyzed cleavage of an ether. Alternatively, perhaps HBr is adding across the double bond.

Wait, the starting material is an allyl ether. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to imagine the structure:

The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the substituent is an ether (O-) attached to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on carbon 2.

So, the substituent is: O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 ?

Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl has a double bond between carbon 3 and 4. So the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. That can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond at C3 and C4, which is impossible because that's beyond the end. So perhaps the correct structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3 (but-2-en-1-yl), making it O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. But wait, the substituent is a but-3-en-1-yl, so maybe the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. That would make sense because the substituent is attached to the first carbon, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. But wait, that would be O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, which is but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is OCH2CH2CH=CH2. But in that case, the substituent has a double bond between C3 and C4, making it an allyl group. Hmm, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, no, but but is four carbons. So substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But that's impossible because the chain ends at C4, so the double bond would be between C3 and C4, which is possible.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. But the question states it's but-3-en-1-yl, so there must be a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, which is a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the reaction. The compound is an ether with an allyl group. When treated with HBr, what reactions are possible?

Ether with an allyl group—maybe acid-catalyzed cleavage. HBr is a strong acid and a good electrophile. Alternatively, HBr could add across the double bond in an electrophilic addition. Since it's an allyl ether, perhaps it's undergoing acid-catalyzed cleavage, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which could then lead to some rearrangement or ring formation.

Alternatively, the HBr could add across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkyl group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but in the case of an allyl ether reacting with HBr, I think the most common reaction is the acid-catalyzed cleavage to form a phenol and an alkyl bromide. For example, an allyl ether (like OCH2CH2CH2CH2) would, under acidic conditions, form a carbocation, leading to cleavage into a phenol (from the oxygen) and an alkyl bromide.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So when HBr (which is H+ and Br-) is added, the H+ protonates the double bond, making it more electrophilic. Then the oxygen acts as a nucleophile and attacks the more substituted carbon (like in acid-catalyzed cleavage of ethers), leading to a carbocation.

Wait, but in this scenario, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is OCH2CH2CH2CH2, but that's not possible due to the double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of HBr across the double bond would occur. Since HBr is a reagent for addition to alkenes, the double bond could undergo electrophilic addition, leading to a bromoalkane attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be an alkyl bromide attached to the oxygen, but the question states that two new spots appear. So maybe it's a cleavage reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reaction outcomes. If HBr adds to the double bond, we would get a bromide at the end. Alternatively, if the ether undergoes cleavage, the oxygen would take a proton, leading to a phenol, and the other part would form a carbocation, which could then capture Br- as a leaving group, leading to an alkyl bromide.

Wait, but the starting material is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or is it OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to proceed. Let me try to think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol.

So phenol derivatives with substituents in the 2 and 4 positions. But wait, the starting material is an ether. If the reaction cleaves the ether, the oxygen would form a phenol. So one product would be phenol. But the options don't show phenol; instead, they show substituted phenols. So perhaps the other product is an alkyl bromide.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Hmm, so one product is a bromo-substituted ether, and the other is another ether with a different substituent. Maybe this is from a rearrangement during the reaction.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

These structures sound more like ring-forming reactions. Chromane is a bicyclic compound, and benzofuran suggests a furan ring attached to benzene. Maybe the reaction leads to ring formation via carbocation rearrangement.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So both products are brominated ethers, with bromine in different positions. That might suggest that HBr is adding to the double bond in different positions, but I don't think that's likely because HBr usually adds to the less substituted position (anti-Markovnikov) in an alkene.

Wait, but in an allyl ether, perhaps the addition of HBr would follow anti-Markovnikov, leading to the bromide adding to the less substituted carbon.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible reaction again.

The starting material is an allyl ether: OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2 attached to benzene. Wait, but that's not correct because it's 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's OCH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would make it but-2-en-1-yl. So perhaps the correct structure is OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2. No, that can't be right because but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached to O.

Wait, maybe I should just accept that the substituent is an allyl group with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the second and third carbons. So OCH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylpropenyl)oxy. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of the allyl ether with HBr leads to two possible products due to different sites of attack. For example, if HBr adds to the double bond in two different positions, leading to different stereochemistry or different regiochemistry.

Alternatively, if the reaction is acid-catalyzed cleavage, perhaps the position of the cleavage leads to different products.

Wait, but the problem states that after some time, the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots appeared. So two products were formed.

Let me think about the structure again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. Let me write that as O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would be beyond the chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible products. If HBr adds to the double bond, what would happen?

Adding HBr to the double bond would follow anti-Markovnikov. For example, in an allyl ether, adding HBr would place the Br on the more substituted carbon. So, if the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2, adding HBr would give OCH2-CH2-CHBr-CH22. But wait, that's butyl bromide attached to oxygen.

Wait, but the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So OCH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, that would make it OCH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, which would be OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's impossible as the chain is only four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it OCH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. But that's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on. Let's think about the reaction.

When an allyl ether is treated with HBr, it can undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage. The mechanism would involve protonation of the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the double bond would protonate, leading to a carbocation. The carbocation could then undergo rearrangement, and the bromide would attack.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So when the double bond is protonated, the carbocation would form at the more substituted position.

So, for example, if the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, protonation would occur on C3, leading to a carbocation on C4. But that's not possible because the chain is only four carbons. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So when HBr is added, the Br would add to the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov). So the product would be OCH2-CH2-CHBr-CH2.

Wait, but with the substituent being 2,2-dimethyl, perhaps the Br adds in a way that gives a more stable carbocation. Alternatively, the cleavage could result in a phenol and an alkyl bromide.

Wait, but if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, then the cleavage would break the chain into two parts. The oxygen would take the left part, becoming a phenol, and the right part would form a carbocation, which would pick up Br-.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option D shows two brominated ethers, which suggests that the bromide is adding across the double bond without cleavage. But if the starting material is an ether and HBr adds without cleavage, that could result in two products if there are two possible positions for addition, such as Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov, but HBr usually follows anti-Markovnikov.

Wait, but in the case of allyl ethers, HBr can add to the double bond in a way that leads to different products based on where the Br adds. Alternatively, if the reaction is a cleavage, perhaps two different products form, such as a phenol and an alkyl bromide with different substituents.

Looking at option B, one product is (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which suggests that the Br is added to the fourth carbon of the substituent. The other product is ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene, which suggests a rearranged double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of different carbocations, which then could result in different products when Br- attacks.

Option C has two cyclic products, which suggests that the reaction forms rings, perhaps via carbocation rearrangements.

Option D has two products where the Br is attached at different positions on the substituent.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide via acid-catalyzed cleavage. For example, the ether could cleave, with the O becoming a phenol and the other part becoming an alkyl bromide.

So if the starting substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, the cleavage could occur at different points, leading to different products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the general reaction of allyl ethers with HBr.

When an allyl ether (like CH2=CHCH2-O-R) reacts with HBr, the H+ protonates the double bond, making it more electrophilic. The oxygen can then attack the more substituted carbon, leading to a four-membered ring transition state and breaking the ether. This process results in the formation of a phenol and an alkyl bromide. For example, OCH2CH2CH2CH2 would cleave to form phenol and CH2CH2CH2CH2Br.

But in this case, the substituent is more complex, with methyl groups.

So perhaps the reaction would cleave the ether, forming a phenol (the O part) and an alkyl bromide (the other part). So the products would be a phenol and an alkyl bromide.

Looking at the options, option A is two substituted phenols. So if the substituent was in position 2, then cleavage would give a phenol in position 2, with the bromide in another position. But option A shows two different substituted phenols, which doesn't fit because one product should be a phenol and the other an alkyl bromide.

Option B has a substituted bromoether and another ether with a different substituent. Hmm, so perhaps that's not cleavage but a rearrangement.

Option D has two substituted bromoethers. So both products are ethers with Br in different positions, which suggests that the reaction didn't cleave the ether but added Br across the double bond.

Wait, but HBr adding to the double bond would result in a single product, unless there's some possibility of addition at different positions, like if the double bond is in a position that allows for different regiochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different carbocations, which then capture Br- to form different products. For example, if the initial carbocation rearranges (like via hydride shift) to a more stable position, leading to different products.

So if the substituent forms a carbocation at position 3, and then perhaps shifts to position 4, leading to different bromide products.

Looking at option D, the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the Br is in position 4 and 3 of the substituent.

Wait, but in the starting substituent, the Br would add to the less substituted side due to anti-Markovnikov. But if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), then the more substituted carbon would be C3, so Br would add to C3, making the product (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. But option D has both 3 and 4 positions, suggesting possible carbocation shifts.

Ah, so perhaps the initial carbocation is formed at C3, and then it undergoes a hydride shift to C4, leading to a more stable carbocation at C4, which then captures Br- to form the 4-bromo product.

So if the reaction forms a carbocation at C3, which can then shift to C4, leading to two possible products: the bromide at C3 and C4.

So the products would be (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which matches option D.

Alternatively, if the reaction adds HBr to the double bond without cleavage, leading to a bromide substitution, but that doesn't explain why two products are formed unless there are carbocation rearrangements.

So the correct answer would be option D.


The reaction involves treating (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether, where the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, and two methyl groups attached to carbon 2. The reaction with HBr can proceed through electrophilic addition or cleavage of the ether.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - HBr can add to the double bond of the allyl ether via electrophilic addition. However, the anti-Markovnikov rule suggests that the bromine (Br) would add to the less substituted carbon of the double bond.  
   - Alternatively, the reaction can involve acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether. Protonation of the oxygen makes it a better leaving group, leading to the formation of a carbocation at the more substituted carbon of the double bond. This carbocation can then capture a bromide ion (Br⁻) to form an alkyl bromide.

2. **Carbocation Rearrangement**:  
   - If the initial carbocation forms at carbon 3, it can undergo a hydride shift to carbon 4 to form a more stable carbocation. This rearrangement explains the formation of two products with bromine at different positions.

3. **Products**:  
   - The reaction produces two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. These correspond to bromine addition at carbons 4 and 3 of the substituent, respectively, due to the carbocation rearrangement.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Suggests two substituted phenols, which is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism as one product should be an alkyl bromide.  
   - **Option B**: Proposes a brominated ether and a rearranged ether, which does not align with the expected products of this reaction.  
   - **Option C**: Suggests cyclic products, which is unlikely given the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material.  
   - **Option D**: Matches the expected products, with bromine added to carbons 3 and 4 of the substituent, consistent with carbocation formation and rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The reaction involves electrophilic addition of HBr to the double bond, followed by carbocation rearrangement, leading to the formation of two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. This matches the description in **Option D**.

Answer: D
