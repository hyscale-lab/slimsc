Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. The details are: we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is usually above 7 because the salt formed (like acetate) will hydrolyze in water to make it basic. So the pH at equivalence point should be higher than 7, which can help narrow down the options. Let me check the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52. So equivalence point is 8.52.
Option B: 3.17; 6.73. 6.73 is acidic, so maybe not since equivalence is often basic.
Option C: 4.73;7.00. 7 is neutral, maybe if the salt is neutral but acetate is basic. Hmm, not sure.
Option D: 4.57;6.92. 6.92 is below 7, which seems unlikely. So I might think options A or B could be possible, but wait, wait. Wait, let me think again. The salt from a weak acid and strong base is basic, so equivalence pH should be above 7, so option A and D have 8.52 and 6.92 respectively. Only A has equivalence pH above 7, so maybe A is a candidate. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake because sometimes I've heard that the pH at equivalence for a weak acid and strong base is around 8-9. Let me not get stuck on that yet.

First, let's tackle each part. The question has two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

So, step 1: Find the diluted concentration of acetic acid after adding water.

Initial volume: 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Diluted with 20 cm³ (0.020 L) water. So total volume is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So the concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH.

At 25% titration: 25% of the moles of acetic acid are neutralized.

Moles of acetic acid initially (after dilution): 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Because when you titrate, you're adding NaOH, which provides OH- ions. Oh, wait, no, NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with the weak acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH.

So the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 moles (from 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001, and then diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M, but moles are still 0.001).

At 25% titration, 25% of the 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, producing 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^- (acetate ion).

So the moles remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles of CH3COOH.

And moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to calculate the concentrations in the solution after adding NaOH.

Wait, what's the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration? Let me think.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. To neutralize 25% of that, you need 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL.

So total volume after adding NaOH is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations in the solution are:

[CH3COOH] = (0.00075 mol) / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = (0.00025 mol) / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution of weak acid and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ let's compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa = -log(Ka).

So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733 → so pKa = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log ( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333, which is 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26, which would match this. Option D has 4.57, which is higher. So that could be the pH at 25% titration.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when you add the NaOH, the volume might be considered correctly.

Wait, the initial volume is 40 mL, and adding 2.5 mL of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 mL, correct.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477, so pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, so we have the acetate ion in solution. The acetate will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

This is a hydrolysis reaction, making the solution basic. So the pH should be above 7.

To calculate pH at equivalence, first find the concentration of acetate ions.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, producing 0.001 moles of CH3COO^-.

The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is (moles of NaOH)/(Molarity NaOH) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So the total solution volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

Concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw/Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.516 -6 = -5.484 → pOH ≈5.484 → pH = 14 -5.484 ≈8.516, which rounds to about 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, another thing: the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So yes, the solution should be basic, and pH around 8.52 makes sense.

So for 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, looking back, earlier I thought the equivalence pH would be around 8.5, which matches, but I thought that option D had 6.92 which is less than 7. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the 25% titration again. Because in my first calculation, I considered that 25% of the moles of acetic acid were neutralized, leading to a ratio of [A^-]/[HA] as 1/3, which led to the pH calculation. But I'm wondering whether the 25% is based on the volume of NaOH added or the moles.

Wait, in the problem statement, the question says "at 25% titration". That usually refers to 25% of the moles of the acid have been neutralized, not 25% of the volume. So that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes, when you dilute a weak acid, the pH can change. But in this case, we diluted 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL of water, so the concentration becomes 0.025 M. Then, when you titrate, each mL of 0.1 M NaOH adds 0.001 moles of OH- (since 1 mL is 0.001 L, 0.1 M * 0.001 L = 0.0001 moles? Wait no, 0.1 M is 0.1 mol per liter. So 1 mL is 0.001 L, so moles of NaOH in 1 mL is 0.1 * 0.001 = 0.0001 moles.

Wait, in the 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added should be 25% of the moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed for 25% is 0.00025. So volume = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. So that's what I did earlier.

So the pH at 25% should be around 4.26, and equivalence point around 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait another point. When you dilute acetic acid, the pH doesn't drop but actually becomes less acidic. Let me think: the initial acetic acid is 0.05 M. After dilution to 0.025 M, the pH would be higher than before. Because the solution is weaker, so less dissociation. But wait, the initial pH of 0.05 M acetic acid can be calculated, but maybe that's not necessary here.

Wait, but when we reach 25% titration, the buffer solution's pH is 4.26. I think that's correct.

So the options: option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That's what I got.

Looking back, the other options:

Option D: 4.57 and 6.92. 6.92 is less than 7, which can't be right for equivalence point.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid neutralized are:

\[
\text{Moles neutralized} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The moles of CH₃COO⁻ are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of CH₃COO⁻ is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of OH⁻ ions at equilibrium. The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH⁻]^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] - [OH⁻]}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] - [OH⁻] \approx 0.02 \). Thus:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.516 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
