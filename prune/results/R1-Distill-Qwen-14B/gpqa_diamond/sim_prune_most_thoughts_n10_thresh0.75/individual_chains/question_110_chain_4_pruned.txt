Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Hmm, let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both instruments.

I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with V less than 17 is observable by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, stars with V less than 16 mag are observable by HIRES.

Wait, wait, I think I got that backwards. The V magnitude scale is a bit confusing. Lower numbers mean brighter stars. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17. Because a magnitude of 17 is dimmer than 16, right? So, if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17, so it can be seen by both. But if a star is 17.5, it can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So, the stars that can be detected by both must have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So that means V < 17. And for HIRES, "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed," so V < 16. So, for a star to be observable by both, its V must be less than 16. Because if it's 16.5, it's higher than 16 and can't be seen by HIRES, but if it's 16.3, same thing. Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify:

ESPRESSO observes V < 17. So anything brighter (V less than 17) is okay. HIRES requires V < 1
