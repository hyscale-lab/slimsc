Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me go through it step by step.

So the scenario is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they created knockout mutants for each, and also some double mutants. The goal was to find genes that contribute to resistance. 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. That's important because if a gene is a transcription factor, its function is to activate or repress other genes.

Now, they tested the mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half the resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% 
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so what's happening here. I'm trying to figure out the interactions between these genes.

First, let's understand what each mutant's resistance tells us. If knocking out a gene reduces resistance, that gene must be contributing positively to resistance. So G2 knockout (g2) is completely susceptible. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Similarly, G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance—so it's less but not completely gone. G3 knockout (g3) is 50%—so also a significant drop but not as bad as g2.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. That's interesting because if both single mutants (g1 and g2) had 75% and 0% respectively, the double mutant g1g2 is as bad as g2. That might suggest that g2 is acting upstream of g1. Because if you have both g1 and g2 knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only g2 is knocked out. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. If G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the case of g1, when only G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%, but lower than wild-type. So perhaps G1 is downstream of another gene, or maybe G1 is part of a redundant pathway.

Let me think about the double mutants again. For g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets. If each alone has 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), their combination is way worse. This suggests that G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, knocking out both might not have a more severe effect than the single knockout with the lower resistance. Alternatively, maybe they are redundant. Or perhaps they work together in some additive way.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Because if you already can't make G2, then G1 isn't working either (since G2 activates it). So the resistance is as bad as when G2 is knocked out.

g1g3: 10% → much worse than either parent. So G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So knocking out both makes the resistance worse than either alone.

But wait, what about g2g3: 0% → same as g2. That suggests that in the absence of G2, G3 doesn't matter. Because without G2, the plant can't resist, even if G3 is present. So G2 is epistatic to G3. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If G2 is epistatic, then it's upstream.

So let me think about the hierarchy. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates both G1 and G3. Because then, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 aren't working, which would be worse than either single knockout.

Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, you lose 25% resistance. Without G2, you lose 100%, which suggests that G2 is required for resistance. Similarly, without G3, you lose 50% resistance.

So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so the resistance is as bad as when both are knocked out. Which is what we see in the double mutants: g1g2 (both G1 and G2 knocked out) is 0%, same as g2. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%—because without G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional.

But wait, let's think about the g1 and g3
