Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from compound A. My goal is to identify compound D based on the given options. Let's break it down.

First, compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and the splitting can give clues about the structure.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these are likely equivalent methyl groups (each a triplet, so maybe adjacent to a CH2 group). The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H probably indicates a CH2CH2 group, but waitâ€”quartet could mean each proton is next to a CH2 group. Wait, no, the splitting comes from neighboring protons. So let me think: a quartet (which is n+1 where n is the number of neighboring H's) implies each H is next to a CH2 (so 2 H's on each neighboring group). Wait, but maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH2, which would cause a quartet?

Wait, another approach. For the triplet, 6H. Maybe two methyl groups, each with 3 H. And each connected to a CH2. So, maybe it's something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2... but that might not fit. Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a diethyl group. Like, two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. Wait, but ethyl groups have a triplet for the CH2CH3. Wait, in an
