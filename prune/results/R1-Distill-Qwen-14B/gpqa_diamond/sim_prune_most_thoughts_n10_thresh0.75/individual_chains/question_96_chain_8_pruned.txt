Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says: The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. There's this formula from the theory of black holes: S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's constant h (but ħ is h/(2π)), gravitational constant G, speed of light c, and Boltzmann's constant k_B.

Wait, right. The entropy S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon. So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon.

The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². But wait, the angular size θ is given. Oh right, θ is the angular size, which relates to the actual size (diameter or radius) via the distance d. The formula I think is θ (in radians) ≈ (size)/(distance). So if θ is in radians, then size is approximately θ * d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. So first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. Because the formula for angular size in radians is more straightforward.

So θ in radians is θ_radians = θ_degrees * (π / 180). Let's compute that. θ_degrees is 1e-17, so θ_radians ≈ (1e-17) * (π / 180) ≈ roughly 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

But wait, for very small angles, the approximation θ ≈ (size)/(distance) holds, where size is the actual length (like the diameter of the event horizon). Wait, but
