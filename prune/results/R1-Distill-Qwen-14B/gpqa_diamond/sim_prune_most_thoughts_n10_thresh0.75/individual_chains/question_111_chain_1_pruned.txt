Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, from the options, I have to choose which combination is correct. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A and B.

Starting with Reaction A: It's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be an enolate formation followed by alkylation or some kind of conjugate addition. Wait, ethyl acrylate is the other reactant. Oh, wait, I've heard about the Claisen condensation or maybe a conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's an example of a Michael addition?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So when a ketone reacts with that under basic conditions, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. So the base (t-BuOK) would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester in a conjugate addition.

Wait, but wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has the carbonyl group at position 1, and at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 12? Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So position 1 is the carbonyl (O=C-), position 2 has an ethyl, and position 6 (which is adjacent to position 5 and 1) has a methyl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

So, the structure is 2-
