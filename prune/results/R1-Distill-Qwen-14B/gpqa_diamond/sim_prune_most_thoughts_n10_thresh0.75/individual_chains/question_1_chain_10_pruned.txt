Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum of the two? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is greater than or equal to ħ/(2π), if I remember correctly. Oh wait, sometimes the uncertainty principle is written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π), but maybe that's when Δt is the measurement time. Alternatively, in the context of spontaneous emission or lifetimes of states, the energy uncertainty is often considered as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be on the order of ħ divided by their lifetime. So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 sec, so ΔE1 ~ ħ/(1e-9). For state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ~ ħ/(1e-8). But wait, because τ2 is larger, ΔE2 would be smaller. So the larger the lifetime τ, the smaller the energy uncertainty.

Wait, but to resolve the two states, the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or the maximum of the uncertainties? Because if ΔE (the actual energy difference) is bigger than each of the uncertainties, then it's clear that they are separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the system's energy. But wait, each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I should model it as the energy difference being larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement
