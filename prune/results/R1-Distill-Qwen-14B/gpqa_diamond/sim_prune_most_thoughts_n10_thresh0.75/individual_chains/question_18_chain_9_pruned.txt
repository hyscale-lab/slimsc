Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me list out the given data. Both stars have masses higher than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times respectively. But I don't think the mass directly affects the composition ratio we're trying to find. The question is about photospheric composition, so maybe it's more about the abundances.

The elemental abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2.

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si/Star_1] to [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) ?

Wait, no, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So
