Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with various fractions of the speed of light.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in annihilation processes, like when particles and their antiparticles meet, they convert their mass into energy, often producing other particle-antiparticle pairs. In this case, the proton and antiproton annihilate into two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. 

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So I can probably approximate its total energy as just its rest energy. Because when something is moving slowly (non-relativistic), the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which is much smaller than mc². So K ≪ mc² → E ≈ mc².

So the proton is at rest? Or the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: in particle collisions, if one is moving and the other is at rest, the initial frame is the rest frame of the target. But here, both are involved in the reaction. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible. 

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me get their masses right. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they are antiparticles of each other.

So, the initial system has energy equal to the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is approximately the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's rest energy. So that's 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV.

Wait, wait, no, wait. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. Or maybe both are moving, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton's energy is just its rest energy. Hmm, perhaps it's better to assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. So initial energy is 2 * m_p c², which is about 1876 MeV.

Wait, but the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving". So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. So the total initial energy is the proton's rest energy (938 MeV) plus the total energy of the incoming antiproton, which is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, kinetic energy is small, so E_anti ≈ m_p c². So the total energy is about m_p c² + m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

Now, the products are 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So four particles in total. Each A has mass 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

Wait, but that's less than the initial energy. So that makes sense because some energy goes into kinetic energy of the products.

So, in a reaction like this, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Since the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a small velocity, we can model this in the center-of-momentum frame, but maybe it's easier to work in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is much less than its rest mass times c. So p_initial ≈ gamma m_p v. But v is small, so gamma is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

But wait, if the antiproton is moving with velocity v, then its momentum is gamma m_p v. But since v is small, gamma is ≈1 + (v²)/(2c²), which is close to 1. So the momentum is approximately m_p v.

But the initial system's momentum is just the antiproton's momentum, because the proton is at rest. So p_initial = m_p v (approx).

After the annihilation, the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Assuming they are all moving and perhaps symmetrically (like two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but maybe not). But perhaps in the lab frame, the total momentum after must equal the initial momentum.

Wait, but if the products are moving, their total momentum must equal the initial momentum.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the lab frame, initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v (since the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest). The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + E_antip (approx m_p c², because the antiproton's KE is small).

After the reaction, the four A particles have some energies and momenta. But because they are produced symmetrically, perhaps their momenta add up in a certain way.

But maybe I can make some approximations because the antiproton is moving slowly. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about the center-of-momentum frame. In the center of mass (CM) frame, initial momentum is zero. So the products must also have zero total momentum. But each product would have some momentum, but their vector sum is zero.

But then, in the lab frame, which is the frame where the proton is at rest, the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v (the antiproton's momentum). So the products must have total momentum equal to this.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the CM frame and then transform back to the lab frame. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in the CM frame, all the energy goes into the rest mass of the products, but wait, no, because the products are moving, so their energies are higher than their rest mass.

Wait, another approach: The total energy in the lab frame is E_initial = m_p c² (proton at rest) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma ≈1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

The total rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the products is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

But I'm not sure how that helps with velocity.

Alternatively, think about conservation of momentum and energy. Let me denote the velocity of each A as v. Assuming they all move in the same direction, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps in the lab frame, the products are moving symmetrically, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe because the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, perhaps they are produced in pairs that move in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel out. But then the total momentum of the products would be zero, which can't be right because the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Let me outline the equations.

Let me denote:

Initial momentum: p_initial = γ m_p v (approx m_p v for small v)

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since γ ≈1 for slow speed).

After the reaction, four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let's assume each has mass m_A, so each has rest energy m_A c² = 300 MeV.

Assume all four particles have the same speed v, but perhaps opposite directions. Wait, but that might not make sense because in the products, each A has momentum p = γ m_A v, but in what direction?

Wait, maybe in the lab frame, two of the A particles move in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and the other two move in the opposite direction. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in pairs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moves in opposite directions, so each pair's momentum cancels out. But then the total momentum of the four would be zero, which can't be correct because the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

So that approach might not work.

Another idea: since the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻, perhaps each of the two A⁺ and two A⁻ has the same speed, but for each A⁺, there's a corresponding A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. Wait, but that would make their momenta cancel each other. So the total momentum would be zero, which contradicts the initial momentum.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should model the problem as an inelastic collision where the products (each A) have some velocity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of energy and momentum conservation. Let me define variables.

Let me denote the velocity of each A as v. Since there are four A particles, but in the products, perhaps they are moving with the same speed but in different directions. But to make it simple, perhaps I'll assume all four have the same speed v, but distributed in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but that's a lot to handle. Alternatively, perhaps the four particles' momenta sum up to the initial momentum. Let me think: if all four have the same speed v, but their directions are arranged so that their momenta sum to p_initial = m_p v.

But how to model that? Maybe two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two are moving in the opposite direction. Let me suppose that two have velocity +v and two have velocity -v. So the total momentum would be (2 * gamma m_A v) + (2 * gamma m_A (-v)) ) = 0. Oh, that doesn't work because the initial momentum is m_p v.

So that approach doesn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same velocity, but I need to find the direction such that the sum of their momenta equals the initial momentum.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to think that the products share the same velocity. But how?

Wait, another approach: in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial momentum is zero. So the products' total momentum must also be zero, which would require that the products' momenta cancel each other. But in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero, so the products' frame has to be boosted.

But perhaps using the invariant mass approach would help. The total invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, the invariant mass squared is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

In the final state, the invariant mass squared is the same, so it's (sum E_i)^2 - (sum p_i c)^2.

But wait, in the initial state, sum E_i is m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since gamma ≈1). Sum p_i is gamma m_p v.

So initial invariant mass squared is (2 m_p c²)^2 - (gamma m_p v c)^2.

In the final state, each A⁺ and A⁻ has energy E_A and momentum p_A. So sum E_i is 4 E_A, and sum p_i is 4 p_A (if all moving in the same direction, but that's probably not the case). Wait, but unless they are moving in a particular arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of A's has opposite momenta. So two moving in +v and two in -v, making the sum of their momenta zero. Then sum p_i would be zero, but that can't be because the initial sum p_initial is m_p v.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that its velocity v is much less than c. So perhaps we can use non-relativistic approximations for the initial conditions, but the products would be relativistic, so their energies can't be approximated.

Wait, but the problem is to find the velocity of particle A, which could be relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is such that the total momentum of the products equals the initial momentum of the antiproton, which is m_p v. Since the initial proton is at rest, so initial momentum is m_p v.

So, the total momentum of the four A particles must be m_p v.

Let me denote each A has momentum p_A and energy E_A. So the sum of their momenta is 4 p_A (if they all move in the same direction), but that would be too much. Alternatively, perhaps two move in the same direction as the initial antiproton and two in the opposite. So sum p = 2 p_A - 2 p_A = 0. No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe each A has the same speed but in different directions. So perhaps two are moving in the direction of the initial antiproton (let's say +x) and two are moving in the opposite (-x). Then the total momentum would be 2 p_A - 2 p_A = 0, which doesn't help because the initial momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, perhaps the two A⁺ are moving in one direction and the two A⁻ in another. Or maybe each A has a different direction, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. So their total momentum is 4 p_A = m_p v. But then their energy would be 4 E_A, which should equal the initial energy plus any kinetic energy. Wait, the initial energy is about 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. So 4 E_A = 1876 MeV.

So each E_A is 469 MeV. But their rest mass is 300 MeV, so their kinetic energy is 169 MeV, and their gamma factor is E_A/(m_A c²) ) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma is about 1.563. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v.

Let me calculate gamma:

gamma = 1.563

So,

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.6395

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (0.6395)^2 ≈ 0.409

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591

v = c * sqrt(0.591) ≈ c * 0.769 ≈ 0.769 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, the initial assumption was that all four particles have the same velocity, which might not be the case. Because if some are moving in opposite directions, their momenta would cancel, which would require the others to have higher velocities to make up the initial momentum. But in this case, I assumed all four move in the same direction, which might not be realistic.

Wait, but the initial momentum is m_p v, and if all four A's are moving in the same direction, then 4 p_A = m_p v.

But let me compute p_A. Since E_A = gamma m_A c² = 469 MeV, and m_A c² is 300 MeV.

p_A = gamma m_A v_A = (gamma m_A c² v_A) / c² = (E_A v_A )/(c²).

Wait, another approach: E_A² = (pc c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2.

So,

p_A c = sqrt(E_A² - (m_A c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (469)^2 - (300)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 219, 961 - 90,000 ) = sqrt(129,961) ≈ 360.5 MeV.

So p_A c ≈ 360.5 MeV.

So p_A = 360.5 MeV / c.

If all four A's are moving in the same direction, then total p = 4 * 360.5 MeV/c = 1442 MeV/c.

But initial momentum is m_p v ≈ m_p c * beta, where beta is v/c.

So initial p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p c * beta.

Wait, but in this scenario, initial p_initial is equal to 4 p_A.

So,

m_p c beta = 4 p_A c

Wait, because p is in MeV/c units.

Wait, wait, let me clarify the units.

p_A is 360.5 MeV/c, so 4 p_A is 1442 MeV/c.

m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So,

m_p c beta = (938 MeV/c²) * c * beta.

So,

(938 MeV/c²) * c * beta = 938 MeV * beta / c.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing units incorrectly. Let me re-express everything in terms of energy and momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the momentum equation as:

4 * p_A = p_initial.

p_initial is the antiproton's momentum, which is gamma m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

But we have:

4 p_A = m_p v.

But p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, but I'm not sure if all A's are moving at the same speed. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed, so v_A = v. But maybe that's an assumption.

Wait, but considering that the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, perhaps all A's are moving with the same velocity.

So, proceeding with that assumption, I can write:

4 * (gamma_A m_A v) = m_p v.

Cancel v from both sides (assuming v ≠ 0):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p.

So,

gamma_A = m_p / (4 m_A) = (938 MeV/c²) / (4 * 300 MeV/c²) ) = 938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817.

Wait, but gamma is always greater than or equal to 1. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), which is ≥1. So if gamma_A is 0.78, which is less than 1, that's impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, that suggests that my assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Because under that assumption, I get gamma_A <1, which is impossible.

So, perhaps some of the A's are moving in the opposite direction. Let's think again: maybe two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and the other two are moving in the opposite direction. So the total momentum from the four A's would be: 2 p_A (same direction) - 2 p_A' (opposite direction) = m_p v.

Wait, but if the two moving in the opposite direction have the same speed, but opposite momentum, then their contribution to the total momentum would be negative. So:

2 p_A - 2 p_A' = m_p v.

Hmm, but this complicates things because now I have two different momenta, p_A and p_A'.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed but different directions, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the system as a head-on collision, and use conservation of energy and momentum.

So, the initial system is the proton at rest and the antiproton moving with velocity v (low speed).

After the collision, four A particles are produced. Let me assume that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are produced in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But perhaps it's easier to model this as a two-body reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, and then transform back to the lab frame.

In the CM frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have total momentum zero. So their momenta must cancel.

In the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products plus their kinetic energies, but in this frame, the initial energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton's energies.

Wait, initial energy in CM frame is sqrt( (E_p + E_p̄)^2 - (p_p c + p_p̄ c)^2 ). Since in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so E_p = m_p c², p_p = 0, and the antiproton has E_p̄ = gamma m_p c², p_p̄ = gamma m_p v.

So the initial energy in the lab frame is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c² (since v is small).

The initial momentum in the lab frame is p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p v.

So the total invariant mass squared is:

s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

s = (2 m_p c²)^2 - (m_p v c)^2.

=4 m_p² c^4 - m_p² v² c².

= m_p² c^4 (4 - (v²)/(c^2)).

But in the CM frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), which equals the sum of the rest energies of the products plus their kinetic energies. However, in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products must have a total momentum of zero.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I should instead compute the velocity of the CM frame and then find the velocity of the products in that frame.

Wait, the velocity of the CM frame (β_cm) can be found from the initial momentum and energy.

β_cm = (p_initial c) / (E_initial).

So,

β_cm = (m_p v c) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v/(2 c).

Since v is small (antiproton is moving slowly), beta_cm is much less than 1, so the CM frame is moving very slowly relative to the lab frame.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe a better approach is to use the fact that in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products have zero total momentum. So their momenta must cancel each other. 

But then, in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the CM frame, the products' momenta would have a boost. So perhaps I can use a Lorentz transformation to find the products' momenta in the lab frame.

Wait, let's denote that in the CM frame, each A has velocity u, but in the opposite directions so that the total momentum is zero. But since there are four A's, perhaps two moving in +u and two in -u, so their total momentum is zero.

Then, when we boost back to the lab frame (moving at velocity β_cm relative to CM), each A's velocity will be transformed.

Wait, but this seems a bit involved. Let me think. Maybe each A in the CM frame has some velocity, and then when we apply a Lorentz boost to the lab frame, their velocities change.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that in the lab frame, each A has velocity v, and since the products must have a total momentum of m_p v, the sum of their momenta is m_p v.

Let me think again about the system. Maybe each A has the same speed, but some moving in the same direction and others in opposite. Let's say two are moving along the initial direction, and two in the opposite.

So in that case:

Total momentum: 2 gamma m_A v - 2 gamma m_A (-v) ?

Wait, no, because if two are moving in +v and two in -v, the total momentum would be 2 gamma m_A v + 2 gamma m_A (-v) )= 0. That's not helpful because the initial momentum is m_p v.

Hmm. So maybe not all A's are moving in opposite directions. Perhaps three in one direction and one in the other. Or some other distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A's are moving in the same direction, but that would lead to a much higher total momentum than the initial. So that would require a negative gamma, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I should make a different assumption. Let's assume that the products are moving with the same speed v, but their momenta add up to m_p v.

So the total momentum of the four A's is 4 gamma m_A v = m_p v.

So,

4 gamma m_A v = m_p v.

Cancel v (v ≠0):

4 gamma m_A = m_p.

So,

gamma = m_p/(4 m_A) = 938 / (4 * 300) ≈ 938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817.

But gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is >=1. So this is impossible. So this suggests that the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is wrong.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's compute the energy and momentum in the lab frame and set up the equations.

In the lab frame, initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Initial momentum p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p v.

After the reaction, each A has energy E_A and momentum p_A.

So, conservation of energy:

4 E_A = 2 m_p c².

=> E_A = (2 m_p c²) /4 = (m_p c²)/2 = 469 MeV.

Because m_p c² is 938 MeV, so 938/2 = 469.

So each A has E_A = 469 MeV, and m_A c² is 300 MeV.

So the Lorentz factor gamma for each A is E_A/(m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563.

So,

gamma = 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c.

Solving for beta:

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

=> sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.6395.

Square both sides:

1 - beta² = 0.409.

=> beta² = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.

=> beta = sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7687 c ≈ 0.77c.

Which is option A: 0.77c.

Wait, but earlier when I tried this approach, I ended up with gamma = m_p/(4 m_A) = 0.7817, which was less than 1. But that was under the assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction, leading to a problem with gamma. But in this current approach, I'm not making that assumption. Instead, I'm just using conservation of energy and assuming each A has the same energy, which gives a feasible gamma.

Wait, but wait a minute. If each A has the same energy, their momenta would be the same as well. So, the total momentum of the four A's would be 4 p_A = 4 gamma m_A v.

But according to conservation of momentum, this must equal the initial momentum, which is m_p v.

So,

4 gamma m_A v = m_p v.

Cancel v (assuming v ≠0):

4 gamma m_A = m_p.

gamma = m_p/(4 m_A) = 938 / (4 * 300) ≈ 0.7817.

But gamma can't be less than 1. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, this suggests that the assumption that each A has the same energy is invalid. Because when I set 4 E_A = 2 m_p c², I get a gamma less than 1, which is impossible.

So, this means that the initial approach of assuming each A has the same energy is wrong. Therefore, the problem is more complicated, and the velocities might not all be the same.

But then, how else can I approach this? Maybe I should consider that the products are moving with varying velocities, but that's a lot more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity I found earlier (0.77c) is correct, but that would imply that the assumption about all A's moving in the same direction is incorrect, but the energy conservation holds.

Wait, but I'm confused now. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

The initial energy is 2 m_p c². The final energy is 4 E_A. So 4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (m_p c²)/2 = 469 MeV.

Each A has E = 469 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV. So gamma for each A is 469/300 ≈ 1.563.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.563)^2) ) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/2.443)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.7687 c.

So, v ≈ 0.77c.

But earlier, when I tried to set the momenta to equal m_p v, I got a problem because it requires gamma = m_p/(4 m_A) which is less than 1. So that suggests that perhaps the assumption that all A's have the same speed is incorrect.

But how else can they move? Maybe two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, but that way the total momentum isn't all in one direction.

Wait, let's think again. Suppose two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two are moving in the opposite direction. Let the speed of the two in the same direction be v, and the speed of the other two be u, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but that's getting complicated because then I have to handle two different speeds and directions.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed, but two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two are moving opposite. Then, the total momentum would be (2 gamma m_A v) - (2 gamma m_A v) ) = 0. But that can't be, because the initial momentum is m_p v.

Hmm, so that approach doesn't work either.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that all the A's have the same speed. Maybe they have different speeds, but that makes the problem more complex. So perhaps I should instead consider that the products have some other arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric and the four A's are produced at rest. But that's impossible because their rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial energy of 1876 MeV. So some kinetic energy exists.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be approached using the fact that the initial momentum is small, so the kinetic energy of the products is high, leading to a high speed.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to recap.

We have:

- Initial energy: E_initial = 2 m_p c².

- Initial momentum: p_initial = m_p v (approx).

- Each A has energy E_A = 469 MeV (from energy conservation: 4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = 469).

From E_A^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2.

So, p_A c = sqrt( (469)^2 - (300)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(219, 961 - 90,000) ≈ sqrt(129,961) ≈ 360.5 MeV.

So, p_A = 360.5 MeV / c.

Then, the total momentum from the four A's is 4 p_A = 1442 MeV/c.

Which must equal the initial momentum m_p v → m_p v = 1442 MeV/c.

So,

v = (1442 MeV/c ) / (938 MeV/c² ) * (1/c) ) → wait, no, let me compute correctly.

Wait, m_p is 938 MeV/c².

So,

m_p v = (938 MeV/c²) * v.

Set equal to 1442 MeV/c.

So,

(938 MeV/c²) * v = 1442 MeV/c → v = (1442 MeV/c) / (938 MeV/c²) ) → units: (MeV/c) * (c²/MeV) ) → c.

So,

v = (1442 / 938 ) c ≈ (1.537) c → which is impossible, because v can't exceed c.

So this suggests that our assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is wrong. Because it leads to v > c, which is impossible.

So, this tells me that our initial approach is flawed. So, perhaps the way to proceed is to consider that not all A's are moving in the same direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. But how?

Wait, let's think about this differently. Let's suppose that the products are moving with a velocity u relative to the center of mass. Since the initial momentum is m_p v, and the CM frame is moving at some velocity β cm relative to the lab frame, perhaps we can find u in the lab frame.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the problem in the CM frame.

In the CM frame, the total initial four-momentum is (E_total, 0), where E_total = sqrt( (E_p + E_p̄ )^2 - (p_p c + p_p̄ c )^2 ).

Wait, but in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so E_p = m_p c², and p_p = 0. The antiproton has E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² (since v is small, gamma ≈1), and p_p̄ ≈ m_p v.

So,

E_total = sqrt( (m_p c² + m_p c² )^2 - (m_p v c )^2 ) = sqrt( (2 m_p c² )^2 - (m_p v c )^2 ) = m_p c² sqrt(4 - v²/(c²)).

In the CM frame, the products must have zero total momentum. So each A has energy E'_A and momentum p'_A, and since there are four of them, their momenta must cancel.

Assuming each A has the same speed u in the CM frame, but moving in opposite directions, making the total momentum zero.

But this would mean that the total energy in the CM frame is 4 E'_A.

Wait, so in the CM frame:

4 E'_A = E_total = m_p c² sqrt(4 - v²/c²).

But in the lab frame, each A has energy E_A = gamma (E'_A + beta cm c p'_A).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let me proceed with the assumption that in the CM frame, all four A's are at rest. But that can't be because their rest mass is 1200 MeV, and E_total is more than that.

Wait, E_total = m_p c² sqrt(4 - v²/c²) = 938 * sqrt(4 - (v²/c²)) MeV.

Assuming v is small, (v²/c²) <<1, so sqrt(4 - v²/c² ) ≈ 2 (1 - v²/(8 c²)).

So,

E_total ≈ 2 * 938 MeV (1 - v²/(8 c^2)).

But in the CM frame, the products have 4 E'_A = E_total. So,

E'_A = [ 2 * 938 * (1 - v²/(8 c²)) ] /4 = (938/2) (1 - v²/(8 c^2 )) ≈ 469 MeV * (1 - v²/(8 c^2)).

But the rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so E'_A must be greater than 300 MeV.

But in the CM frame, each A has E'_A = gamma' m_A c², and momentum p'_A = gamma' m_A v'.

But since in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel.

Assuming each A has the same speed u in opposite directions, so two moving in +u and two in -u.

Then, the total momentum is zero. So, in the CM frame, each A has E'_A = gamma' m_A c², and p'_A = gamma' m_A u.

But for the two moving in +u, their momentum is + gamma' m_A u each, and for the two in -u, it's - gamma' m_A u each. So sum is zero.

So, the total energy is 4 gamma' m_A c² = E_total.

So,

gamma' = E_total/(4 m_A c²) ) = [ m_p c² sqrt(4 - v²/c^2) ] / (4 m_A c² )

= [ m_p sqrt(4 - v²/c²) ] / (4 m_A )

= [938 MeV / c² * sqrt(4 - v²/c²) ] / (4 * 300 MeV/c² )

= [938 sqrt(4 - v²/c^2) ] / (1200 )

= [ (938/1200) * sqrt(4 - v^2/c^2) ) ]

= [ (0.7817) * sqrt(4 - v^2/c^2) ) ]

But in the CM frame, each A has E'_A = gamma' m_A c² = (0.7817 * sqrt(4 - v^2/c^2)) * 300 MeV.

But in the lab frame, each A has E_A = gamma (E'_A + beta_cm c p'_A ), where beta_cm is the velocity of the CM frame relative to the lab frame.

Wait, beta_cm is the velocity of the CM frame as seen from the lab. As computed earlier, beta_cm = p_initial c / E_initial = (m_p v c) / (2 m_p c^2) ) = v/(2 c).

So beta_cm = v/(2 c).

In the CM frame, each A has momentum p'_A = gamma' m_A u.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express the relationship between the energies in the two frames.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make an approximation because the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is much less than c. So v^2/c^2 is small, and I can expand in terms of v.

So, let me consider that v is small, so v^2/c^2 is negligible. So,

E_total ≈ m_p c² * sqrt(4) = 2 m_p c².

So, in the CM frame, each A has energy E'_A = (2 m_p c²) /4 = (m_p c²)/2 = 469 MeV.

But the rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so gamma' = E'_A / (m_A c^2) ) = 469/300 ≈ 1.563.

So, in the CM frame, each A has gamma' = 1.563, so their speed u is given by:

gamma' = 1/sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)) → 1.563 = 1/ sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 )

→ sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2 ) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.6395 → 1 - u^2/c^2 = 0.409 → u^2/c^2 = 0.591 → u = 0.7687 c ≈ 0.77c.

So, each A has speed u ≈ 0.77c in the CM frame.

But now, how does this translate to the lab frame?

The lab frame is moving at beta_cm = v/(2c) relative to the CM frame.

So, the velocity of each A in the lab frame can be found using the velocity addition formula.

But since in the CM frame, two A's are moving at +u and two at -u, their velocities in the lab frame will be:

v_lab = (u + beta_cm c ) / ( 1 + (u beta_cm)/c )

But wait, beta_cm is v/(2c), so beta_cm c = v/2.

So,

v_lab = [ u + v/2 ] / [ 1 + (u v)/(2 c²) ) ]

Since v is small, v << c, the denominator is approximately 1. So,

v_lab ≈ u + v/2.

But u is 0.77c, and v is small, so v/2 is negligible compared to u. Hence, v_lab ≈ u ≈ 0.77c.

Hmm, but wait, if the A's are moving in opposite directions in the CM frame, their velocities in the lab frame would add with the CM velocity.

For the A's moving in the same direction as the CM frame (i.e., same as the initial antiproton), their velocity in the lab frame would be u + beta_cm c.

For those moving opposite, it would be -u + beta_cm c.

Wait, but beta_cm is small, so for the A's moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, their lab velocity is u + beta_cm c ≈ u. For those moving opposite, it's -u + beta_cm c ≈ -u + something small, which would be a large negative velocity, which is not possible because they can't go faster than c in the opposite direction.

Wait, but actually, when you boost a frame, velocities add according to the relativistic formula, but in this case, since the CM frame is moving at a small beta, the velocities are approximately added linearly.

But perhaps, given that beta_cm is small, the velocities in the lab frame are approximately u plus beta_cm c or minus u plus beta_cm c.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, given that beta_cm is small, the effect on the velocity would be minimal. So perhaps the velocity of each A in the lab frame is approximately 0.77c.

But earlier, when I assumed all four A's are moving in the same direction, I got a problem with momentum, but under the assumption that they are moving in opposite directions in the CM frame, which translates to a mix in the lab frame, perhaps the velocities are indeed around 0.77c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. So that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

### Key Information:
1. **Reaction**: \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \).
2. **Antiproton is moving slowly**: This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy, so its total energy is approximately \( m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p \) is the proton (and antiproton) mass.
3. **Mass of \( A \)**: \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
4. **Proton mass**: \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conservation Laws:
- **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the reaction must be equal.
  - Initial energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} \).
  - Final energy: \( E_{\text{final}} = 4 E_A \), where \( E_A \) is the energy of each \( A \)-particle.
  - From energy conservation: \( 4 E_A = 2 m_p c^2 \), so \( E_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4} = \frac{m_p c^2}{2} = 469 \, \text{MeV} \).

- **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the reaction must be equal.
  - Initial momentum: \( p_{\text{initial}} = m_p v \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the slow-moving antiproton.
  - Final momentum: The four \( A \)-particles are produced symmetrically, and their momenta must sum to \( p_{\text{initial}} \).

### Relating Energy and Momentum for \( A \)-particles:
Each \( A \)-particle has:
- Rest energy: \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
- Total energy: \( E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV} \).
- Momentum: Using the relativistic relation \( E_A^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 \), we find:
  \[
  p_A c = \sqrt{E_A^2 - (m_A c^2)^2} = \sqrt{469^2 - 300^2} \approx \sqrt{129,961} \approx 360.5 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]
  Thus, \( p_A = \frac{360.5}{c} \, \text{MeV}/c \).

### Velocity of \( A \)-particles:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is determined by the relativistic relation:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Solving for \( v \):
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \approx \frac{1}{1.563} \approx 0.6395,
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.6395^2 \approx 0.409,
\]
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591,
\]
\[
v = c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769c \approx 0.77c.
\]

### Final Answer:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
