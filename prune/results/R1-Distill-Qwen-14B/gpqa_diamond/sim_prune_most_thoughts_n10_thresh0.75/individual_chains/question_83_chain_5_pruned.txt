Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I know and how to approach this.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The questions are about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction produces acetate ions and water. The pH changes based on how much of the base has been added.

Let me start by figuring out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity = moles/volume(L). So moles = Molarity × Volume(L). The volume in liters is 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. The new concentration is moles/volume, so 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find out how much is needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point. 

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, it could mean that 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence has been added. Hmm, I should clarify that. Oh, in titration problems, when they say at a certain percentage, it usually refers to the amount of acid neutralized. So 25% titration implies 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the total volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence first. Then 25% of that volume would be the point where 25% of the acid is neutralized. I think that's the way to go here.

So let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from 0.05 M * 0.02 L). So moles of NaOH needed would also be 0.001. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = mo
