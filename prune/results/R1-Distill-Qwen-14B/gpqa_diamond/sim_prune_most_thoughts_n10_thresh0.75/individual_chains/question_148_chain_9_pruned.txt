Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of them, which suggests that Y has a few common oxidation states with fluorine. Binary compounds mean each has only two elements, so Y and F.

Looking at the information given:

1. Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oxygen (I think they mean fluorine, since we're talking about F compounds) percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, no, the question says ɷF is 31.96%. Oh right, ɷ is the Greek letter omega, which I think stands for the weight percent of fluorine. So A2 is a compound where F makes up about 31.96% of its mass.

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and fluorine gas. So the decomposition reaction might look something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let me think about known fluorine compounds that decompose upon heating. Fluorine is a halogen, and many of its compounds are stable but some decompose under certain conditions.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, but fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. If A1 can oxidize xenon, it must be a strong oxidizing agent itself. Fluorine compounds that are strong oxidizers include F2 (but A1 is a compound, not elemental F2) and maybe something like YF5 or YF4 if Y is a highly electronegative element.

Wait, fluorine is the most electronegative element, so Y must be a metal that forms multiple binary fluorides. Fluorine usually forms binary compounds with metals, which typically have +1, +2, +3 oxidation states. But since there are five compounds, Y must have five possible oxidation states when combined with fluorine. Hmm, but most metals don't have five different oxidation states in binary fluorides. Wait, perhaps Y is a group 15 element, but that seems unlikely. Or maybe group 18? No, because they don't form many fluorides.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a transition metal
