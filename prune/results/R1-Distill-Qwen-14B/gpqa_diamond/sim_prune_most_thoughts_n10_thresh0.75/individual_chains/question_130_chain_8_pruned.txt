Okay, so I've got this science question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We're supposed to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. Lyman alpha is the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen, and it's in the ultraviolet range. Wait, the wavelength given is 1216 Angstroms, which is about 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet, right? Because I know that the Lyman series is in the UV.

So, the quasar's light is being absorbed by these hydrogen clouds. When a cloud has a higher redshift, the wavelength of the absorbed light is stretched. So for a cloud at redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, the problem is about detecting this absorption. Optical ground-based telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is redshifted into the optical range, it would be detectable.

What's the cutoff for optical wavelengths? I think the atmosphere is mostly transparent to wavelengths longer than about 300 nm or so. Wait, no, the cutoff is around 300 nm in the near UV. But ground-based optical telescopes typically observe from about 300 nm to maybe 1000 nm or more. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range, it can be observed.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. To be in the optical range, it needs to be observed at a longer wavelength than 300 nm (since optical is roughly 400-700 nm, but maybe they're considering up to 300 nm as the limit for what can be observed from the ground).

Wait, no, the atmosphere doesn't transmit much below about 300 nm. So for ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be at least around 300 nm for it to be detectable. So the redshifted Lyman alpha must be at least 300 nm.

So, let's set up the equation. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). We want lambda_obs >= 300 nm.

Wait, but wait. Lambda_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So 121.6 * (1 + z) >= 300 nm.

Solving for z: 1 + z >= 300 / 121.6 â‰ˆ 2.468.

So z >= 1.468. So the lower limit on redshift is about 1.468. But wait, this is the minimum redshift needed for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical.

So looking at the options, the choices are 1.2 (B), 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), and 3 (A). So 1.468 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the lower limit would be just above 1.46, meaning the minimum z is about 1.47. So the options don't have that exact number, but let me look again.

Wait, the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift so that the objects can be detected. So the minimum z where the Lyman-alpha is just entering the optical range. So the minimum z is when lambda
