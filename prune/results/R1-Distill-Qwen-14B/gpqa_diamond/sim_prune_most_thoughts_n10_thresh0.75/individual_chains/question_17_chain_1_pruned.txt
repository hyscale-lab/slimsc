Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25Â°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. And the options are various concentrations of calcium ions. I need to find out what the concentration of calcium ions is in the solution.

Wait, what's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stoichiometric ratio here probably refers to the fact that each EDTA molecule binds one calcium ion. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- or something like that.

Formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right, that's the general idea. So, K is a big number (5e10), which means the complex formation is very favorable. So most of the Ca and EDTA should form the complex, leaving very little free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

The initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of Ca^2+ in the solution. Since K is so large, the dissociation would be minimal, right? So the concentration of Ca^2+ would be very small.

Let me think about the setup. Let me denote the concentration of Ca^2+ as 'x'. Then, since the complex dissociates into 1 Ca^2+ and 1 EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be 'x'. But wait, initially, the solution is just the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero.
