Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let's think this through.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R, so it's a small dent inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, which means P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some important properties when it comes to charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. So if it's uncharged, initially there are no free charges on it. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, that should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, how does that work again? Oh yeah, the charge +q inside the cavity would attract negative charges to the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was neutral before, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. But then, since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out.

So the conductor's outer surface has a +q charge. Now, for points outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center. Right, because a spherical shell of charge behaves like a point charge when you're outside it. So the electric field at P would be due to the +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

But wait, where exactly is that +q located? The conductor is a sphere, so the charge distribution on the outer surface is symmetric only if the charge inside the cavity is at the center. But in this problem, the cavity's center is shifted by s from the conductor's center. Oh, that complicates things. So the +q is placed somewhere off-center inside the cavity. Hmm, but how does that affect the induced charges?

Let me think. The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the +q inside the cavity would attract negative charges. But since the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center, the inner surface's charge will be distributed in a way that the electric field inside the conductor (which is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium) is zero.

Wait, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges redistribute until the internal field is zero. But the presence of the cavity's charge changes things. Oh wait, I think I need to use the concept of method of images or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's induced charge will still be symmetrically distributed. Because any external points would "see" the outer charge as a point charge, regardless of the inner arrangement. Because the induced charges on the inner surface would be such that the outer surface's shape remains symmetric.

Wait another thought: the outer surface's charge is +q. So when you are outside the conductor, the electric field due to the outer charge is as if it were a point charge at the center of the conductor. So regardless of the internal arrangement (like the position of the +q inside the cavity), the external field is just due to the total outer charge, which is +q.

So at point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field should be as though the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L. Therefore, the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Wait, but wait. The options have different expressions. Let me check the
