Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 suggests an -OH group because O-H stretches usually show up there, and a broad peak is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Oh wait, 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or aldehyde. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in aromatic compounds). Wait, but if it's two carbonyls, that would imply something like a ketone and maybe an ester or another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is conjugated, like an aromatic ring's C=C. But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower than typical for a C=O. So maybe it's an aromatic ring? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. That makes me think maybe an alkene is present.

Then the Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let me think. Common fragments: maybe a CH3O group? Or a ketene? Alternatively, maybe a small functional group. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's 45? Let me calculate: (CH3)2O is C2H6O. The molecular weight would be (2*12)+(6)+(16) = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh wait, that's 46. So no, maybe not that. What else? Maybe a ketone fragment? Like a CH3CO group? Wait, CH3CO would have a molecular weight of 58 (12*2 +3 +16). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a smaller
