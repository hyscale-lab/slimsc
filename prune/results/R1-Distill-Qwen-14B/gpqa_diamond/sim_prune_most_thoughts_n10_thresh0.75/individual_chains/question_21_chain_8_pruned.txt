Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then there are two parts, A and B, which I need to determine the correct answers for. The options are given, and I have to choose between four possible answers (A, B, C, D). 

Let me break it down. 

First, part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm. I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen atoms and electrons, which leads to different structures. For example, in carbonyl compounds, like ketones or aldehydes, tautomerism isn't possible because they don't have adjacent hydrogen atoms on the carbonyl group. But wait, benzoquinoneâ€”what is that? Oh right, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually two carbonyl groups connected in a benzene ring. Wait no, wait. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, forming a quinone structure. So its structure is O=C6H3=O, but arranged in a way that allows for resonance. 

Wait, but does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? I think tautomerism is more about keto and enol forms. So in ketones or aldehydes, the keto form is when the oxygen is double-bonded, and the enol form has an alcohol group adjacent. But for that to happen, the carbonyl group needs to be next to an -OH group. 

Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Let me think. So, can it undergo tautomerism? Benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. I'm trying to remember. Oh wait, quinones are generally not capable of tautomerism because the structure doesn't allow the necessary hydrogen shifts. Alternatively, maybe that's not the case. Another thought: tautomerism requires adjacent hydrogens. Benzoquinone's structure is a six-membered ring with two keto groups opposite each other. So each oxygen is on a carbon that's adjacent to another carbon with
