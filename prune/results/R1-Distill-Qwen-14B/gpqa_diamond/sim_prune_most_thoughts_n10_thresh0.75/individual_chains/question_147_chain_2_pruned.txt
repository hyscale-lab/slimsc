Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles, right? The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, the question says it's p plus anti-p. So, protons and antiprotons annihilating each other.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe its velocity is much less than the speed of light? Or perhaps it's important because the mass of the product particles, A⁺ and A⁻, is given. Wait, m_A c² is 300 MeV. I think that's the rest mass energy of the A particles.

I need to find the velocity of the particles A. The options are various speeds as a fraction of c.

Wait, but what's the setup? Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate something here. Let me think about conservation laws. In any annihilation process, both energy and momentum are conserved.

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. I should consider their rest masses. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c². The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so m_p c² = 938 MeV, and m_p̄ c² is the same.

Wait, but in the problem, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial momentum isn't too high.
