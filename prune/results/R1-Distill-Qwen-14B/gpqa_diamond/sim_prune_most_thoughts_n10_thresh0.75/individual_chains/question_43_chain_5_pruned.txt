Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about naming a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to find the correct IUPAC name from the options given.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information. The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta to each other means each is separated by two carbons, right? So if I imagine the benzene ring, these three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5 if the first is position 1. But wait, no, wait. Because the numbering starts with the functional group of highest priority. Oh wait, right, the substituents are numbered based on the seniority of the functional groups. Carboxylic acid is the highest priority, so that's position 1.

Then, the other groups are meta to each other. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde (formyl group) is at position 3, and the cyano group is at position 5? Or maybe it's a different arrangement. Wait, the problem says all meta to one another, meaning each is meta to the others. So perhaps each substituent is at a position that's two away from each other on the ring. Like, 1, 3, 5 positionsâ€”so each is meta to the others. But wait, in a benzene ring, 1,3,5 are all meta to each other? Well, 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 1 and 5 are para. Hmm, that's a problem because 1 and 5 would be para to each other. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each pair is meta. Wait, maybe it's a different setup. Maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that they are all meta relative to one another. Wait, maybe it's more like the substituents are each meta to the others, but given benzene's structure, perhaps they are in positions 2,4,6. Because in that case, each substituent is meta to the others. Because 2 and 4 are meta, 4 and 6 are meta, and 6 and 2
