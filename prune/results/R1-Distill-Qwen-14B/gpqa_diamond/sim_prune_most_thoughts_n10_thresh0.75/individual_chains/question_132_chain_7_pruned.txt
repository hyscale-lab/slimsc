Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm, okay. So each compound is C10H14. Let me check the molecular formula for each option to see if they fit.

Wait, the formula C10H14—aromatic compounds. So each is a substituted benzene with methyl groups. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so four methyl groups in adjacent positions) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, but 1,2,3,4 has four methyl groups in a row, which might make it something like a 1,3,5-trisubstituted if some are adjacent? Wait no, 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions. Wait no, benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would mean four adjacent positions, making a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl benzene. That's a very substituted ring.

Wait, but wait, how about the molecular formula. Each benzene with four methyl groups would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) → C10H14. Yes, that fits. So each of these compounds would be C10H14.

Wait, but for the diethylbenzene in option C, 1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl is CH2CH3, so two ethyl groups add 2*(2 carbons) = 4 carbons. Benzene is C6, so total 10 carbons. Hydrogen? Each ethyl is 5 H (since each CH2CH3 has 2 CH2 groups: CH2CH3 has 2*(2) +1 (from CH3) = 5 H per ethyl). Wait, no, each ethyl is -CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H. So two ethyl groups would add 10 H. Benzene normally has 6 H, but when substituting, each substituent reduces it. Wait, but in 1,4-diethylbenzene, there are two substituents. Benzene has 6 H, minus 2 substituents (each ethyl replacing a H), so 4 H. So total H would be 4 + 10 (from ethyls) =14. So C10H14. So that's correct.

So all the options are correct regarding the molecular formula.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each 1:1, so maybe each aromatic region corresponds to each compound. But wait, each compound would have their own aromatic protons. If each is a 1:1 mixture, but the signals are two singlets, maybe each compound's aromatic protons are equivalent and produce a singlet.

Wait, but let me think about each possible structure:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's draw this. Positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. That's four consecutive positions on the ring. Wait, that leaves positions 5 and 6 with no substituents. But wait, substituting four positions, so perhaps the structure is such that the aromatic protons are all equivalent? Hmm, no, because in a tetra-substituted benzene, the symmetry could lead to equivalent protons.

Wait, wait, let me think: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl benzene would be a benzene ring with four methyl groups on adjacent positions. So the structure would be 1,2,3,4-tetra-... Hmm, wait, benzene is a ring, so if you have four substituents in a row, 1,2,3,4—so positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other? Wait, no, because on a benzene ring, position 1 and 4 are across from each other (para positions), whereas 2 and 5, 3 and 6, etc. So putting methyl groups on 1,2,3,4 would create a structure where 1 and 4 are adjacent? No, wait, no. Wait
