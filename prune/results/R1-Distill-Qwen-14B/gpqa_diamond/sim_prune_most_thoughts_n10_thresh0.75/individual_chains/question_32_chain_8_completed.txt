Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy of RHIC. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons and 4 neutrons in its common isotope, like Li-7. But if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 total, so the mass is that of Li-6.

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think the atomic mass unit (u) is involved here. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I'll need the mass number of Li-6. Li-6 has a mass number A = 6 (since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons). So the rest mass m is 6 u.

Wait, but wait, maybe not exactly. Because I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is a bit different. Let me recall. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be:

(3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) = let me compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995
Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

So the rest mass m is 6.047823 u. Now I need to convert that into GeV/c². Since 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c². So:

m = 6.047823 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u = let me calculate that.

6.047823 * 0.9315 ≈ Let's compute:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589
0.047823 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.0446 (because 0.04 * 0.9315=0.03726, 0.007823 *0.9315≈0.007288 → total ~0.04455)
So adding, 5.589 + 0.04455 ≈ 5.63355 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 6.047823 * 0.9315 GeV/c² would be:

Let me compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

Now 0.047823 * 0.9315: 0.04 *0.9315=0.03726; 0.007 *0.9315=0.0065205; 0.000823 *0.9315≈0.000766. So adding those: 0.03726 + 0.0065205 = 0.0437805, plus 0.000766 → ~0.0445465.

So total m ≈5.589 +0.0445465 ≈5.6335 GeV/c².

Wait wait, wait, no. Because 6.047823 u is the mass. Each u is 0.9315 GeV/c². So m = 6.047823 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that precisely:

6.047823 × 0.9315.

Let me write this as (6 + 0.047823) * 0.9315 = 6*0.9315 + 0.047823*0.9315.

6*0.9315 is 5.589.

0.047823 * 0.9315: let's calculate 0.047823 * 0.9315.

0.04 *0.9315 is 0.03726.

0.007823 *0.9315: 0.007 *0.9315=0.0065205, 0.000823 *0.9315≈0.000766. So 0.0065205 +0.000766=0.0072865.

Adding to 0.03726 → 0.0445465.

So 5.589 +0.0445465=5.6335465 GeV/c².

So m ≈5.6335 GeV/c².

Now, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma * m c². So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c². But wait, wait: the total energy E is gamma m c². The kinetic energy would be E - m c² = (gamma -1) m c². So I need to find the total energy E.

But the problem says the energy of the RHIC, which I'm assuming refers to the total energy per nucleus. So E = gamma m c².

We need to find gamma when the speed v is 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So let's compute gamma first.

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = sqrt(784/10000) → sqrt(784)=28, so 28/100=0.28.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma ≈3.5714.

Now, the rest energy is m c², which we've calculated as 5.6335 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.6335.

Let me compute 3 *5.6335 =16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335.

Well, 0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335 → approx 0.405.

So 2.81675 + 0.405 ≈3.22175.

Total E =16.9005 +3.22175 ≈20.12225 GeV.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6335.

Let me do it step by step:

5.6335 *3 =16.9005

5.6335 *0.5 =2.81675 → 16.9005 +2.81675=19.71725.

5.6335 *0.0714=?

0.0714 is approximately 714/10000.

5.6335 *0.07 =0.394345.

5.6335 *0.0014=0.0078869.

So 0.394345 +0.0078869≈0.40223.

Adding to 19.71725: 19.71725 +0.40223≈20.11948 GeV.

So about 20.119 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

So my calculation got approximately 20.119 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I made a rounding error in the rest mass calculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 u but 6.047823 u as I calculated? Let me double-check that.

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.

Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 =3.025995 u.

Total = 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u. That's correct.

So m =6.047823 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u.

Calculating that: 6.047823 *0.9315.

Let me compute that more accurately.

6 * 0.9315 =5.589.

0.047823 *0.9315:

Let me compute 0.04 *0.9315=0.03726.

0.007823 *0.9315: 0.007 *0.9315=0.0065205, 0.000823 *0.9315=0.0007662.

Adding them: 0.0065205+0.0007662=0.0072867.

Adding to 0.03726: 0.0445467.

So total m =5.589 +0.0445467=5.6335467 GeV/c².

So m c² is 5.6335467 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6335467.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.6335467 *3 =16.9006401.

5.6335467 *0.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7, since 25 divided by 7 is about 3.57142857.

So 5.6335467 * (25/7) = (5.6335467 *25 ) /7.

5.6335467 *25: Let's compute.

5 *25 =125.

0.6335467 *25 =15.8386675.

Total 125 +15.8386675=140.8386675.

Divide by 7: 140.8386675 /7 ≈20.11981 GeV.

So E ≈20.1198 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise values for the mass of Li-6 or constants used.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic masses. Maybe the exact mass of Li-6 is slightly different. Let me check: in reality, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512278 u.

Wait a second! Oh, wait, I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Because when you take the mass of the nucleus, you have to subtract the binding energy, but wait, perhaps I shouldn't be adding the protons and neutrons directly. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to the mass defect (binding energy). So maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, no. When calculating the rest mass of the nucleus from its components, you add the masses of the protons and neutrons and then subtract the mass of the electrons. But actually, the atomic mass includes the electrons. Hmm, maybe I confused the atomic mass with the nuclear mass.

Wait, this is a key point. The question refers to the nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. The mass I should use is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus, not the atomic mass including electrons.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512278 u. But the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Li has 3 electrons, so 3 * 0.00054858 u each (electron mass is about 0.00054858 u).

So nuclear mass m = 6.01512278 u - (3 * 0.00054858 u).

Calculating that: 6.01512278 - 0.00164574 = 6.01347704 u.

Then, convert to GeV/c²: 6.01347704 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u = ?

6 *0.9315 =5.589.

0.01347704 *0.9315 = ?

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.00347704 *0.9315 ≈0.003244 (because 0.003 *0.9315=0.0027945; 0.00047704 *0.9315≈0.0004457. So total 0.0027945 +0.0004457≈0.0032402.

So 0.01347704 *0.9315 ≈0.009315 +0.0032402=0.0125552.

Adding to 5.589 → 5.589 +0.0125552≈5.601555 GeV/c².

Wait, that's a different value. So m c² is about 5.601555 GeV.

Hmm, so that's a lower value than before. So with this more accurate approach, the rest mass energy is about 5.601555 GeV.

Then, gamma is still 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601555.

Let me compute this:

5.601555 *3 =16.804665.

5.601555 *0.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7, so E = (25/7) *5.601555.

Which is (25 *5.601555)/7.

25 *5.601555 =140.038875.

Divide by 7: 140.038875 /7 ≈20.0055536 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0056 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419.

Wait, so maybe I should re-examine. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6 including electrons.

Wait, no. The nucleus mass is the mass without the electrons. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the nuclear mass, which is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the atomic mass, including electrons, because when particles are accelerated, their rest mass includes the electrons if they're ions. Or perhaps the question refers to the nucleus as a bare nucleus, so only the mass of the nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the mass of the nucleus is considered as the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, which would be 6.047823 u, as I did earlier.

Wait, because in particle physics, when considering heavy ions like in RHIC, they're usually considering the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, not accounting for the binding energy. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach.

Wait, but that led me to about 20.1198 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, as before. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, since 28^2=784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So if the rest mass is 5.6335467 GeV/c², then the total energy is 3.57142857 *5.6335467 ≈20.1198 GeV.

But the options have C)20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternative approach: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but I should compute gamma more accurately, perhaps using more precise v.

Wait, 0.96c is exact, but perhaps more accurately, gamma can be calculated using the exact formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v=0.96c → (v/c)=0.96.

So 1 - (0.96)^2 =1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Yes.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me recheck the nuclear mass.

Wait, perhaps the correct mass is the atomic mass of Li-6 minus the mass of 3 electrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512278 u.

Each electron mass is approximately 0.00054858 u.

So nuclear mass is:

6.01512278 u - 3 *0.00054858 u =6.01512278 - 0.00164574=6.01347704 u.

So m =6.01347704 u.

Convert to GeV/c²: 6.01347704 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u.

Compute:

6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

0.01347704 *0.9315 = ?

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.00347704 *0.9315 → approximately 0.003477 *0.9315.

Let me compute 0.003477 *0.9315:

0.003 *0.9315 =0.0027945.

0.000477 *0.9315 ≈0.0004458.

Adding: 0.0027945 +0.0004458=0.0032403.

So 0.01347704 *0.9315 =0.009315 +0.0032403=0.0125553 GeV.

So total m c²=5.589 +0.0125553=5.6015553 GeV.

So E =gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6015553.

Let me compute that.

5.6015553 *3 =16.8046659.

5.6015553 *0.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7, so 3.57142857 =25/7.

So 5.6015553 *25 =140.0388825.

Divide by 7: 140.0388825 /7 =20.0055546 GeV.

So about 20.0056 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should check the initial approach again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the relativistic energy formula in terms of kinetic energy. Wait, but the question says 'the energy of the RHIC', which is the total energy, so E=gamma m c^2.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of c and u, but I think that shouldn't change the result much.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the relativistic energy formula without considering the exact mass, perhaps using a rounded mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0478 u.

Wait, if I use 6.0478 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ?

6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.0478 *0.9315=0.04456.

So m c²=5.63356 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.63356.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.63356.

Hmm, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, so 25/7 *5.63356.

25 *5.63356=140.839 (since 5 *25=125, 0.63356 *25=15.839 → total 140.839).

Divide by 7: 140.839/7=20.119857.

So approximately 20.1199 GeV.

Which matches option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places. Let me compute 25/7 *5.6335467.

25 *5.6335467 =140.8386675.

Divide by 7: 140.8386675 /7=20.11981 GeV.

Hmm, so 20.1198 GeV.

The options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

So option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher than our calculated 20.1198. But perhaps the exact calculation would result in 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Let me calculate m c² precisely.

m =6.047823 u.

Each u is exactly 931.494065 MeV/c². So 1 u =931.494065 MeV/c² =0.931494065 GeV/c².

So m c²=6.047823 *0.931494065 GeV.

Compute 6 *0.931494065 =5.58896439 GeV.

0.047823 *0.931494065.

Compute 0.04 *0.931494065 =0.0372597626.

0.007823 *0.931494065.

Let me compute 0.007 *0.931494065=0.006520458455.

0.000823 *0.931494065≈0.0007674 (approx 0.000823 *0.9315=0.000767).

So 0.007823 *0.931494065≈0.006520458455 +0.000767≈0.007287458455.

Add to 0.0372597626: 0.0372597626 +0.007287458455 =0.044547221 GeV.

So m c²=5.58896439 +0.044547221 =5.63351161 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.63351161.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 is 25/7 → exactly 3.57142857142857...

So 25/7 *5.63351161 = (25 *5.63351161) /7.

25 *5.63351161 =140.83779025.

Divide by7:140.83779025 /7=20.11968432 GeV.

So approximately 20.11968 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I should look for a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is not exactly 3.57142857, but let's compute it more accurately.

v=0.96c → v²= (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28= 3.57142857.

So that part is exact.

Wait, but perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, so maybe the calculation should use more precise terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic energy formula with gamma calculated as (1 - (v/c)^2)^(-1/2).

But in any case, our calculation gives E≈20.11968 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.012 GeV. That's about 12 MeV. The question says the precision is at 1e-4, so four decimal places. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using more precise values.

Wait, let me compute 25/7 *5.63351161 exactly.

25/7=3.57142857142857...

5.63351161 *25=140.83779025.

140.83779025 /7=20.11968432142857 GeV.

So 20.11968432 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.1320 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the mass. Let me check another source.

Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually about 6.013598 u, according to more precise tables.

Wait, if the nuclear mass is 6.013598 u, then m c²=6.013598 u *0.931494065 GeV/u.

So compute:

6 *0.931494065 =5.58896439 GeV.

0.013598 *0.931494065 =?

0.01 *0.931494065=0.00931494065.

0.003598 *0.931494065.

Compute 0.003 *0.931494065=0.002794482195.

0.000598 *0.931494065≈0.000555443.

So 0.003598 *0.931494065≈0.002794482195 +0.000555443=0.003349925.

So total 0.013598 *0.931494065=0.00931494065 +0.003349925=0.01266486565.

So m c²=5.58896439 +0.01266486565=5.601629255 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.601629255.

Compute:

5.601629255 *3.57142857.

Hmm, same as 5.601629255 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.601629255 *3=16.804887765.

5.601629255 *0.57142857.

5.601629255 *0.5=2.8008146275.

5.601629255 *0.07142857 ≈approx 0.399999997 (since 0.07142857 is 1/14, and 5.601629255 * (1/14) ≈0.400116375).

Adding: 2.8008146275 +0.400116375≈3.2009310025.

So total E=16.804887765 +3.2009310025≈20.0058187675 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0058 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of v=0.96c, and compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects the use of the formula E = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, that's the same as gamma * m c².

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the exact gamma for v=0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculations.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857142857...

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach with the mass as 6.047823 u gives E≈20.1198 GeV, which is even closer to option C (20.132 GeV).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the nuclear mass calculation. Let me check a reliable source for the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact nuclear mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013598 u.

So using that, m c²=6.013598 u *0.931494065 GeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *0.931494065=5.58896439 GeV.

0.013598 *0.931494065.

0.01 *0.931494065=0.00931494065.

0.003598 *0.931494065=0.003349925.

So total m c²=5.58896439 +0.00931494065 +0.003349925 =5.58896439 +0.012664865≈5.601629255 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.601629255 ≈20.0058 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects the use of the initial approach without accounting for the electrons, giving m c²=5.6335 GeV, leading to E≈20.1198 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem does not account for the nuclear binding energy and uses the sum of protons and neutrons, giving E≈20.1198 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. But the options have C as 20.132, which is very close.

Another possibility: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but due to rounding in the calculation, the answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Rest Mass of Li-6
The nucleus of Li-6 consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate masses of a proton (\( 1.007276 \, \text{u} \)) and a neutron (\( 1.008665 \, \text{u} \)):

\[
m_{\text{Li-6}} = (3 \times 1.007276) + (3 \times 1.008665) = 6.047823 \, \text{u}.
\]

Converting to GeV/c² using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.9315 \, \text{GeV/c}^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.047823 \times 0.9315 = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\gamma\)
The speed is \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \approx 20.1198 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy (\( 20.1198 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or minor differences in constants used during the calculation.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
