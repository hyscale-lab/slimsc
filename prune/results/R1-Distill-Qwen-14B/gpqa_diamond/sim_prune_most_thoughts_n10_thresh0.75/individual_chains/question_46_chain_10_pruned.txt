Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And the task is to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

So, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, the formula is C5H10. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let's count the carbons.

Wait, pent implies five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the chain is five carbons long, with a double bond at the first position and a methyl branch on the third carbon.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the formula would then be C5H10, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would make the chain longer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I should write it correctly.

Wait, pentane is five carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-
