Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let's try to work through it. The question is about why there are discrepancies in the scientist's results. Hmm.

Alright, first, let me make sure I understand what's given. The scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each concentration, which are 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per µl. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means that each cycle perfectly doubles the DNA, so efficiency is at maximum. The R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. 

Looking at the Ct values, each concentration is ten times less than the previous one, right? So from 100000 to 10000, that's a 10x dilution, and similarly down to 10.

Wait, the Ct values are getting lower as the concentration increases. Oh, right, because higher amounts of DNA reach the threshold (where you can detect it) faster, so lower Ct values mean more copies. So 100000 copies have a higher Ct than 10000? Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, higher starting copies would reach the threshold sooner, so lower Ct. Oh wait, but in the data, 100000 has a Ct around 33-34, while 10 has a Ct around 20-21. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I'm confused. Wait, higher concentration should have lower Ct. Because more copies mean you hit the threshold earlier. So 100000 is the highest concentration, and the Ct is 33.9, 34.2, etc. But 10 copies have a Ct of 20.7, which is lower. So that's the opposite. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. No, no, no—higher concentration should have lower Ct. So if
