Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet stuff, but let me think it through. 

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because their time is limited. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same masses, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their orbits are circular. 

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but they match in size. 

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out the transit probability for each and pick which is higher.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like R_p / (2a) * (R_s / a) or wait, maybe I should think about it more carefully.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) / something else. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. But I'm getting a bit confused. 

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the impact parameter. Wait, no, that's not exactly the probability.
