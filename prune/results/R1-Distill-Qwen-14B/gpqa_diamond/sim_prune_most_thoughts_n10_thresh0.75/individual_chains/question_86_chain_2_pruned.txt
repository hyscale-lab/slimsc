Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used an unknown compound (A and B) treated with different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. The task is to select the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm. So, the reactions involve reducing agents. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+, and the second uses BH3 and H+. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration, but wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Or is it the other way around? Wait, LiBH4 is more powerful and can reduce more things, like esters, amides, etc., but BH3 is more selective, maybe for ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but the products are both tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. That structure sounds like a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So, 2H-pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone, like a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So, 4-ethyl would mean an ethyl group at position 4.

The product has the configurations (R) and (S), so the starting materials must have been ketones that upon reduction form alcohols with specific configurations. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you typically get a secondary alcohol. But wait, in this case, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone or an ester?

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. In some cases, it can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but wait, if the starting material is an ester, then treatment with LiBH4 could result in the formation of a diol? Or maybe
