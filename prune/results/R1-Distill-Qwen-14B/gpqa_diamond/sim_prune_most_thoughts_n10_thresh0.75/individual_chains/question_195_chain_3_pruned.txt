Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period of Planet B such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbital planes are aligned.

First, I need to recall what transit and occultation mean. Transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked. For both events to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbital periods allow them to pass in front and behind each other relative to the star.

Wait, no. Wait, for occultation, the planet has to pass behind the star. So if both are orbiting the same star, their orbital periods must be such that their positions relative to each other are in the right places. But wait, the key here is that they should have orbital periods where they can sometimes be in front and sometimes behind. But since they're in the same orbital plane, their orbits are synchronized in that sense.

But wait, for both transit and occultation events to occur, the second planet must be able to pass in front of the star (transit) and also pass behind the star (occultation) from our perspective. So for that, the planet's orbital period must be such that it can be in a position to do both.

But how do the orbital periods relate here? Hmm. I think I'm missing something. Let me think about the Hill sphere or the synodic period. Or perhaps it's about orbital velocities and the timing of when they can be in line.

Wait, maybe the issue is about whether the second planet's orbital period is shorter or longer than the first planet's. Since the first planet has a 3-day period, if the second planet has a shorter period, it would orbit faster, so it could
