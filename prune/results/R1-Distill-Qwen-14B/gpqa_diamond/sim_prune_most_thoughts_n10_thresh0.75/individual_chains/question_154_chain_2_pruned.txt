Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me look at the Mass Spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, so the major peak is 156, and there's a fragment at 158. Wait, usually when you have a molecular ion, it's the highest mass peak. But 158 is higher. Oh, wait, sometimes the molecular ion can lose or gain something. But wait, 158 is higher by 2 units. Could that be a Cl isotope? Chlorine has isotopes at about 35 and 37 Cl. So the molecular formula might include Cl.

Let me think about the molecular weight. 156 is the molecular ion. Let's see, possible molecular formulas. Let's assume it's C8H5ClO2 or something similar. Wait, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching. Broad usually means it's an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, another possibility is an amide, but that would have a different pattern. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. 1720 is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725), ester (similar), or maybe an acid chloride (higher, around 1800). But the 1720 is more like a carboxylic acid or ester, perhaps.

Looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), which is a strong indication of an -OH proton, possibly from a carboxylic acid. Because aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but this is higher. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad, but the given peak is a singlet. Hmm, carboxylic acids usually have broad peaks, but sometimes in DMSO or certain conditions, maybe it's a sharp peak? Or could this be an aldehyde? Wait, no, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but 11 is higher. Maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually around 5-7, unless it's strongly deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group with an -OH adjacent? Or perhaps it's an -OH attached to an electron-withdrawing group, making it more deshielded.

Wait, wait, the 11.0 ppm singlet could also be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9.5-10.5, but I've heard that sometimes it can be higher. Wait, but in this case, the integral is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But then what's the rest of the NMR?

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the coupling would be such that each proton is next to the substituent. Wait, no, if it's para, the coupling between the two sets of protons would be J around 8-9 Hz. So for example, if it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each substituent has two
