Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to determine the major products for each and match them to the options given.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt in EtOH as the base. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's an enolate-rich compound. It has two acetyl groups attached to a single carbon, so when deprotonated, it forms a strong nucleophile at the alpha position.

The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The E configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

After the attack, the product would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate. Since it's a conjugate addition, the structure would link the two. Let me draw this mentally: the acrylate has a p-tolyl group on one end and a COOCH3 on the other. When the enolate adds, the malonate's carbon (from the enolate) would connect to the beta carbon of the acrylate, which is the middle carbon in CH2=C(...). So the product would be a tricarboxylate ester.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-; when it acts as the donor, it would contribute two COOCH3 groups and the new CH group. The acrylate has the p-tolyl, then the CH2-COOCH3. So after addition, the structure would be something like COOCH3-C-O-(CH2-CH(p-tolyl))-COOCH3? Maybe not, perhaps it's more like the donor adds to the acceptor, making a longer chain.

Alternatively, the product would be a trimethyl ester of 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Because the malonate has two COOCH3 groups, and the acceptor brings the p-tolyl. So A would be that structure. Looking at the options, options A and B have trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate as A, while C and D have 3-(p-tolyl) variants.

So for part A, the product is probably the 2-(p-tolyl) structure, which is present in options A and B.

Moving to part B: the reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions are MeOH and H3O+. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN, with E configuration? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN? Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N? Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-C≡N? No, wait, but I think but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN? Hmm, perhaps I should get the structure right. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, but that would be but-1-enenitrile. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CN in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCN, but that would be propenenitrile. Wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2-CN, but that doesn’t sound right. Maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CN? Or perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCN, which would be allyl cyanide, but that's propenenitrile.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile would have four carbons. So, position 2 is between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond? Wait, no. Let me think. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, that would be buten-1-ene nitrile. Alternatively, perhaps but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the nitrile is on C4? No, that's not possible because but has four carbons, so but-2-enenitrile would be CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CN with the double bond between C2 and C3. Hmm, maybe it's (E)-but-2-enenitrile as CH2=CHCH2CN,
