Okay, so I have this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Hmm, wait, first, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on an integer quantum number, n. The formula for the energy is E_n = (n²) * E, right? Because E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy when n=1. So for n=1, it's E, n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh, right, they're spin-1/2 particles, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system. So each particle must have a unique state.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, and the spin. Since each particle has spin 1/2, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins. Because spin is an intrinsic property, each n can have two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

So for each n, two particles can occupy that level. Let me think: how does this affect the arrangement of the four particles?

We need to arrange the four particles in the lowest possible energy states according to the exclusion principle. So the ground state would have the lowest possible n's, each with their two possible spins.

Let me think about filling the energy levels. The first level, n=1: can hold two particles. The next, n=2: holds two more. But wait, we have four particles in total. So n=1 and n=2 would each have two particles.

Wait, but wait. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So n=1 can have two, n=2 can have two. But n=3 and beyond would be higher. So with four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles.

So the ground state would have all four particles in the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (again, each with opposite spins). So the total energy would be the sum of all their individual energies.

Each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E. So 2 * E. Similarly, the two in n=2 contribute 4E each, so 2 * 4E. So total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the problem says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible, which would be the configuration I just described.

Wait, but then what's the first excited state? Or maybe I'm mixing up the states. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest energy, and when you excite the system, you promote the highest possible particle to the next available energy level.

Wait, but since all the particles are in the lowest possible states, the first excited state would involve moving one of the higher particles to the next available state. But in the ground state, all the lowest states are filled up to n=2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: each n can hold two particles, so n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the next available state is n=3, which is unoccupied.

To find the first excited state, I think you promote one of the particles from the highest occupied state (n=2) to the next available state (n=3). So in the first excited state, you'd have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energies would be 2*(1² E) + 1*(2² E) + 1*(3² E) = 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles there give 2E. The remaining two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 8E. That's the ground state, total 10E.

If the first excited state has one of the n=2 particles promoted to n=3, then the energies would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) (one in n=2) + 1*(9E) (one in n=3) → 2 +4 +9 =15 E. So total energy is 15E.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state adds a particle to n=3. But wait, all four particles are already in the ground state, so to get excited, perhaps the next configuration is when one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. So the energies would change accordingly.

But then, the first excited state would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*1 +1*(4) +1*(9) = 15 E.

What about the second excited state? That would be when another particle moves up. So maybe two in n=3? But wait, each n can hold two particles (with opposite spins). So for n=3, two particles can be placed. But the maximum number of particles is four, so let me see.

Wait, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So the first excited state would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Second excited state could be two in n=1, two in n=3, but wait, n=2 is empty? No, because that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the ground state, n=1 has two, n=2 has two.

First excited state: one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. So energy is 2*E + 4E +9E =15 E.

Wait, but wait, when you promote a particle, you replace a lower n with a higher n. So the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + (4E from n=2) + (9E from n=3) =15 E.

Second excited state: perhaps another particle is promoted. So from n=2 to n=3, but now n=2 has zero, and n=3 has two. So n=1 has two, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. The energy would be 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*(9E) (n=3) = 2E + 18E = 20 E.

Wait, but wait. Let me sum it again: 2*E (n=1) → 2E, 0 from n=2, 2*
