Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two binary systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations for each system have different amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. I guess I have to find the mass ratio.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method gives us the velocity of each star around the center of mass. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass, right? So the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.

The formula I recall is that the velocity of each star is proportional to the mass of the other. So, for a binary system, if M1 and M2 are the masses, then V1 is proportional to M2, and V2 is proportional to M1. So, V1/V2 = M2/M1.

But wait, in the problem, each system's two stars have different RV amplitudes. Oh, because each star has its own velocity variation as they orbit the common center of mass. So, for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me think about that.

Let me denote the velocities as V1 and V2 for each system. So, for system_1: V1a = 10 km/s, V1b = 5 km/s. For system_2: V2a=15, V2b=10.

Since the stars in each system orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, M1a/M1b = V1b/V1a. Similarly for system_2: M2a/M2b = V2b/V2a.

Wait, let me get that right. The mass ratio M1a/M1b equals V1b/V1a. So for system_1, M1a/M1b = 5/10 = 1/2. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio. So the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = (1 + 2) * M1a = 3 M1a. But maybe I don't need the individual masses, just the total.

Wait, but how does the period come into play here? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The period of the binary system is related to the masses and the size of the orbit. The formula for the orbital period is given by Kepler's law, which in this context is P^2 = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars.

But wait, in the problem, the period is given, so maybe I can use that to relate the masses. Wait no, because the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. Oh
