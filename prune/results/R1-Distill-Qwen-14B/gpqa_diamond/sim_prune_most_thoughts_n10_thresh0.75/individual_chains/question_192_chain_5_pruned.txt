Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small cavity inside it. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So, the cavity isn't touching the outer surface, right? 

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given as A to D, each with different expressions. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the conductor's inner surface must induce some charges.

Wait, yeah. When you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. But wait, no, wait. The conductor itself is neutral, so the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Oh wait, no, waitâ€” the conductor is uncharged. So when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. But then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance out.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor's total charge is zero. The cavity has +q. So the inner surface must have -q induced so that the field inside the conductor is zero. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance the net charge, making the conductor's total charge zero again.

But wait, no. Let me get this straight. The conductor as a whole is neutral. So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface (inside the conductor, facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q.
