Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene to include a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. However, when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The key point here is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. The problem must be in the construct they made. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand, so I'm looking for issues that would prevent the proper expression of the protein.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation in its sequence, it might affect purification, but would it prevent expression? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. Because the question says they couldn't overexpress, not that the protein wasn't purifying.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a premature stop codon. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. Looking at the DNA sequence, which is in the plus strand, the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me scan for any possible stop codons in the mRNA.

Wait, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, so the mRNA would be complementary to the DNA. So the mRNA would have the codons in the same order as the DNA, but T becomes U. So for the DNA, each codon is the same as the mRNA, except T becomes U. So if the DNA has a TAC, the mRNA would be AUG, which is a start. Wait, no, the DNA's coding strand is the same as mRNA, but with T instead of U. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA's sequence, replacing T with U.

So looking for any of the stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the mRNA. Let me look through the sequence:

Looking for 'UAA', 'UAG', 'UGA' in the mRNA. Let me go through the sequence.

The provided DNA sequence is:

5' ... ATG ... ... ... TGA ... ... '

Wait, near the end, I see '... ATG ...', but let me look for the TGA in the DNA. Because in the DNA, the plus strand has TGA as part of the coding sequence. In mRNA, that would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's look for the TGA triplet in the DNA. Let me scan through the string.

Looking at the sequence provided: I'll look for TGA. Let me see:

The sequence is long, but let me split it into parts. Let's see:

Looking for 'TGA' in the DNA... Hmm. Let's see:

... ATGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, I think near the end, I see 'GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, looking for TGA. Let me check: 

Looking for three letters in a row: T G A.

Looking through the sequence. Let's see, does TGA appear?

In the last part: ...CAGTGA3' So that's C A G T G A. Wait, the last part is 'GAGTGA', so that's the last six nucleotides: G A G T G A.

Wait, the last part is ...GTGA3'. So the last three nucleotides are TGA.

So the DNA sequence ends with TGA. So in the mRNA, that would be UGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So the construct ends with a UGA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, before the entire protein is made. So that would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed. Because the mRNA has a stop codon at the end, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, the plasmid's coding sequence ends with TGA. But wait, in the DNA, the coding sequence should not have a stop codon introduced unless it's intended. So if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, the construct should have the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the DNA ends with TGA, which is a stop codon in the mRNA, that would terminate the protein early.

Wait, but why would the construct end with TGA? Because the provided DNA sequence ends with 'TGA' as the last three nucleotides. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

But wait, in the DNA strand given, the coding strand is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be synthesized as complementary to the template strand. Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let's clarify.

The construct is designed so that the coding sequence starts with ATG (the start codon) and continues with the GADD45G gene, including the HA tag. If the DNA ends with TGA, but the plasmid is designed with the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, then the presence of TGA at the end might be a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct includes a termination codon. Wait, but in the way the question says, they introduced the HA tag at the N-termin
