Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation effects come into play. Right, from Einstein's theory of relativity. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The question says that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we want to know how long the trip takes from their perspective. Oh right, because of time dilation, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) would be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how long it takes according to the astronaut. So we need to calculate the proper time for the trip. Proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler.

But first, I need to figure out the distance the spacecraft has to cover. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think its distance from Earth is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me pick a rough average, maybe 160,000 light-years. Wait, but the exact number might not matter because the answer options are in the tens of years, so maybe the distance cancels out in the calculations somehow. Hmm.

Wait, okay,
