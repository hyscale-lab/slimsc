Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that these particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Hmm, right. So, the key here seems to be figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the particles' ability to travel the distance before decaying. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. But wait, wait—I think I might be mixing things up here.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The particles are fast-decaying, which probably means their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame) is very short. So the question is about how gamma affects their lifetime in the lab frame, allowing them to reach the detector walls.

So, the particles are produced at the center, and they have to travel the radius of the detector to reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the distance each particle must travel is 30 meters.

The initial Lorentz factor is 20, and under that condition, only one third of the particles make it. The problem is asking for a gamma that would let two-thirds make it.

I think the key is the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls and whether their lifetime is sufficient for that. Let me think about the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall.

In the lab frame, the time t is distance divided by velocity. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their velocity v is close to c. So, approximately, t ≈ (30 m) / (v). But since v ≈ c, let's say v = c. Then t ≈ 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds or 100 nanoseconds. But wait, that's just a rough calculation.

But the proper lifetime of the particle is tau (tau_0), which is its lifetime in its rest frame. The lab frame lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau_0. For the particle to reach the wall, the lab frame lifetime must be greater than the time it takes to travel 30 meters. So, gamma * tau_0 > t.

But wait, the problem says that in the initial case, with gamma = 20, only one third of the particles reach the wall. That suggests that the average lifetime when gamma is 20 allows a third to reach. So perhaps the average lifetime is such that the probability of the particle decaying before reaching the wall is 2/3, meaning that the ones that reach have a probability of 1/3. Hmm, but that would be a decay probability, not the lifetime. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of particles that decay before traveling the distance.

Wait, maybe I should model it as a decay process. The number of particles that decay before time t is given by N(t) = N0 * (1 - e^(-t/(tau))). So the fraction of particles that decay before time t is (1 - e^(-t/(tau))).

In the initial case, when gamma is 20, only one third reach the walls. So two-thirds decay before reaching. So the fraction that decay is 2/3. Therefore:

1 - e^(-t/(tau)) = 2/3.

So e^(-t/(tau)) = 1/3.

Thus, -t/(tau) = ln(1/3) → t/(tau) = ln(3).

So tau = t / ln(3).

Wait, but tau
