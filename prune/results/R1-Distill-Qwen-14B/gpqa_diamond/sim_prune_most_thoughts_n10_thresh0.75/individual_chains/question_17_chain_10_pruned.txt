Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which I think means we don't have to worry about the pH affecting the EDTA's form or anything. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants can be a bit tricky, but I think they tell you how much the complex forms. So higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, what's the formula for the formation constant? I think it's Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So the formation constant represents the equilibrium between the free ions and the complex.

But wait, the solution given is the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So initially, I'm assuming that the solution is made by adding Ca^2+ and EDTA in a 1:1 ratio, so the complex formed is CaEDTA^2-.

Now, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. Oh, so I need to find [Ca^2+], given that the complex is 0.02 M and Kf is 5e10.

Wait, but when you have a solution with the complex, the concentration of the complex is the total concentration of Ca in the form of the complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

But considering the dissociation of the complex, some of it will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. So the equilibrium would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is given, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant Kd. Wait, no, Kf is the formation constant, so Kf = 1/(Kd). So if Kf is 5e10, then Kd would be 1/(5e1
