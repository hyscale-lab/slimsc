Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs, right?

I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path is determined by the probability of such interactions. If the mean free path is small compared to the size of the universe, then the particles can't travel far and their lifetimes are effectively shortened. So, the energy where this happens would be the cutoff where their lifetime is about the same as the age of the universe.

Wait, the problem says the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. Oh right, the CMB is mostly at microwave frequencies, so each photon doesn't have much energy. But there are a lot of them because the universe is vast.

So the process is gamma + CMB photon → e+ + e-. For this to happen, the gamma has to have enough energy. I think the cross-section for this process probably peaks at a certain energy ratio. I recall that for pair production by a photon in the CMB, the energy of the gamma needs to be much higher than the rest mass of an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, that's just the threshold. The actual process would be when the gamma has enough energy to create the pair.

But in this case, since the CMB photon is low energy, the gamma needs to have enough energy to make up the rest mass when combined with the CMB photon. So the condition must be that the sum of their energies is at least twice the electron mass (since each electron is 0.511 MeV, so together 1.022 MeV).

Wait, no. The center-of-mass energy must be at least 1.022 MeV. So the combined energy should be that. But since the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma, maybe we can approximate. Let me think.

The energy of the CMB photon is about kT, where T is the CMB temperature. Oh, right, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The photon energy is k*T. Let me calculate that. Boltzmann's constant k is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. So 2.7 K * 8.617e-5 eV/K = approx 2.3268e-4 eV. But the question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. Hmm, perhaps it's using a different approximation or considering the peak of the blackbody spectrum. Oh well, the problem gives it as 1e-3 eV, so I'll go with that.

So the CMB photon energy E_photon is 1e-3 eV. The gamma has energy E_gamma. For pair production, the condition is that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2*m_e*c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. So the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least that.

But how to calculate the condition for the reaction? I think the reaction's cross-section is significant when the gamma energy is such that E_gamma * E_cmb ~ (m_e c^2)^2. Because when the product of the photon energies is on the order of the square of the electron mass, the reaction becomes possible.

Wait, I think the threshold condition is when E_gamma * E_photon ≈ (m_e c^2)^2. Because for pair production, the photon must have enough energy when combined with another photon. Or wait, maybe it's when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2*m_e*c^2.

Let me think more carefully. When considering two photons colliding, the condition for them to produce a pair is that the total energy in their center-of-mass frame is at least 2*m_e c^2. Since each photon has energy E1 and E2, the condition is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) >= 2 m_e c^2.

But photons have E = p c. So sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos(theta) ) where theta is the angle between them? Wait, no, the momentum vectors. Oh, the photons are moving in opposite directions. Wait, no, typically for pair production in a photon-photon collision, they are moving in opposite directions in the lab frame, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the center-of-mass energy. The total energy squared for a photon-photon collision is s = (k1 + k2)^2, where k1 and k2 are the photon four-momenta. For the process to produce an electron-positron pair, we need sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ). Since E = p c for photons, and if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Let's say photon 1 has momentum p in +x direction, photon 2 has momentum q in -x direction. Then p1 = p, p2 = -q. So when you add them, it's (p - q) in the x direction.

Wait, but if it's a head-on collision, then the total momentum is (p1 - p2) if they're moving in opposite directions. But if they're moving in the same direction, then the momenta add. But in the CMB frame, the photons are isotropic, so the average photon's direction isn't in any particular direction. But when considering a single gamma photon moving through a sea of CMB photons, the effective collision would be a head-on one because the gamma has a particular direction, and the CMB photons are isotropic, so the most probable collision is with a photon coming from the opposite direction.

Hmm, I think the key point is that the maximum center-of-mass energy occurs when the photons are moving directly towards each other. So in that case, the momenta are opposite, and the magnitude of the sum momentum is |p1 - p2|.

But maybe it's better to work through the math. Let's define photon 1 as the gamma with energy E_gamma, moving in the +x direction. Photon 2 is a CMB photon with energy E_photon, moving in the -x direction. Then their four-momenta are:

Photon 1: (E_gamma, E_gamma, 0, 0) [since E = p c, so p = E/(c), but in natural units c=1, so p = E]

Wait, no. The four-momentum is (E, p_x c, p_y c, p_z c). Wait, no, in units where c=1, it's (E, p_x, p_y, p_z). So for a photon moving in +x, p_x = E/c, but with c=1, p_x = E. So photon 1 has four-momentum (E_gamma, E_gamma, 0, 0).

Photon 2 is moving in the opposite direction, so its momentum is (E_photon, -E_photon, 0, 0), because its momentum is in -x direction.

Adding the four-momenta: the total energy is E_gamma + E_photon, and the total momentum is E_gamma - E_photon (since photon 2 contributes -E_photon in the x direction).

The square of the total four-momentum is (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma - E_photon)^2. Let me compute that:

s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma - E_photon)^2
= [E^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2] - [E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2]
= (E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2) - E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon - E_photon^2
= 4 E_gamma E_photon

So sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt( E_gamma E_photon )

For the process to be possible, sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2. So:

2 sqrt( E_gamma E_photon ) >= 2 m_e c^2

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt( E_gamma E_photon ) >= m_e c^2

Square both sides:

E_gamma E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2

So E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon

Wait, that makes sense. So the minimum energy of the gamma-ray for the reaction to occur is when E_gamma * E_photon ≈ (m_e c^2)^2.

Given E_photon is 1e-3 eV, and m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2 = approx 0.2611 * 1e12 eV².

Then E_gamma >= (0.2611e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )

Calculating: 0.2611e12 / 1e-3 = 0.2611e15 eV = 2.611e14 eV. Wait, that's 261.1 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options, they are in the order of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e5 GeV = 1e8 eV. Wait, that doesn't match. 261 GeV is way lower than the options given. The options start at 9.5e4 GeV, which is 9.5e4 * 1e9 eV = 9.5e13 eV, which is way higher than what I just calculated.

Hmm, did I make a mistake here? Let me double-check.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the units. Let's recompute.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV or 5.11e5 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 (eV)^2. (5.11)^2 is about 26.11, so 26.11e10 eV².

E_photon is given as 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma >= (26.11e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 26.11e13 eV.

Wait, 26.11e13 eV is 2.611e14 eV, which is 2.611e8 GeV, since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. Wait, wait, no: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.611e14 eV = 2.611e5 GeV (because 1e14 /1e9 = 1e5). So 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

But wait, why is the problem about the lifetime of the gamma-ray being limited by this process? Because if the gamma-ray's energy is above this threshold, it can annihilate with CMB photons, thereby reducing its number density over time.

The mean lifetime would be determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the cross-section and the density of CMB photons. The cross-section would increase as the gamma energy approaches the threshold, but for energies much higher than the threshold, the cross-section might decrease because the available phase space or some other factors limit it.

Wait, but the question is about the energy at which the lifetime is limited. So the critical energy is the one where the mean free path of the gamma-ray equals the size of the universe. Or perhaps the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light.

The mean free path is c * tau, where tau is the lifetime. So if the lifetime is the age of the universe, the gamma-ray can't travel further than the size of the universe. So the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the universe's size would be the cutoff.

But in this case, I think the main point is just the threshold energy where the process becomes possible. Because for E_gamma above this, the cross-section is non-zero, and the gamma-rays start to annihilate.

So the answer should be at E_gamma ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_photon.

Plugging in the numbers, as before, gives around 2.6e5 GeV. So the correct option is C.


To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy $\gamma$-rays in the universe is limited by annihilation with CMB photons ($\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$), we analyze the threshold energy for this process. The reaction requires the center-of-mass energy of the system to be at least equal to the rest energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 \approx 1.022$ MeV. 

For a $\gamma$-ray of energy $E_\gamma$ interacting with a CMB photon of energy $E_{\text{photon}}$, the condition for pair production is derived from the center-of-mass energy:

\[
\sqrt{s} = 2\sqrt{E_\gamma E_{\text{photon}}} \geq 2m_e c^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
E_\gamma E_{\text{photon}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Given $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV and $E_{\text{photon}} = 10^{-3}$ eV, we calculate:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{photon}}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{0.2611 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option C, which corresponds to $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, the energy at which the lifetime of $\gamma$-rays is limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.
