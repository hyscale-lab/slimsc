Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is asking me to find the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the interaction of high-energy particles with the CMB. 

Let me think. The CMB is a background radiation filling the universe, and its average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So the typical photon from the CMB is around that energy. High-energy gamma-rays can annihilate with these CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. 

I think this process is about the interaction rate. If a gamma-ray interacts too much, its lifetime is limited because it's being annihilated quickly. So we need to find the energy where the mean free time for annihilation becomes significant compared to the age of the universe, I guess. 

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance the particle travels before interacting. If the mean free path is smaller than the universe's size, then the gamma-rays would have been absorbed by now. So the energy where the mean free path is comparable to the universe's size would be the cutoff. 

The cross-section for this annihilation process must play a role here. The cross-section is probably a function of the center-of-mass energy of the two gamma-rays. Wait, but in the lab frame, one photon is from the CMB (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma-ray. 

The reaction gamma + gamma -> e+ e- requires that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c^2, where m_e is the electron mass. But wait, the electron mass is around 0.511 MeV. So 2*m_e is about 1.022 MeV. So if the center-of-mass energy is above that, the reaction can proceed. 

But how does the energy of the high-energy gamma relate to this? Let me think in terms of center-of-mass energy. The CMB photon has energy E_cmb, and the gamma-ray has energy E_gamma. The center-of-mass energy squared, s, is given by (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2. But because E = pc for photons, this simplifies to (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma - E_cmb)^2, because the spatial momenta are in opposite directions. 

Wait, no. Wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions when they collide. So the total energy is E_gamma + E_cmb, and the total momentum is E_gamma - E_cmb (assuming they are moving head-on). So the invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. 

So s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - ( (E_gamma - E_cmb) )^2. Let me compute that: 

s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2 
= [E_γ^2 + 2E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb^2] - [E_γ^2 - 2E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb^2]
= 4 E_γ E_cmb.

So sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) c^2. Wait, units? E_γ is in energy units, E_cmb is as well. So s has units of (energy)^2, so sqrt(s) is energy. So the center-of-mass energy is 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb). 

This must be at least equal to twice the electron mass, so 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c^2. Dividing both sides by 2: sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) >= m_e c^2. Squaring both sides: E_γ E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2. 

So E_γ >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb. 

Given that E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. Let me compute (m_e c^2) in eV. m_e is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (0.511e6 eV)^2 is (0.511e6)^2 eV^2. 

So E_γ >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) 

Let me calculate that: (0.511e6)^2 is (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². 0.511 squared is about 0.261. So 0.261e12 eV². Divided by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e15 eV. 

But wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but wait, 1e15 is 10^15 eV. Hmm, but the options are in GeV, so let's convert eV to GeV. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. Wait, 1e14 eV is 1e5 GeV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV, which is 261,000 GeV. 

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. Option B is 1.8e5, option D is 3.9e5. So that would point to option C. 

But wait, did I get the calculation right? Let me double-check: 

E_γ >= ( (0.511e6 eV) )^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Wait, 0.511e6 is 5.11e5 eV. So (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV². 5.11 squared is about 26.11. So 26.11e10 eV². Divided by
