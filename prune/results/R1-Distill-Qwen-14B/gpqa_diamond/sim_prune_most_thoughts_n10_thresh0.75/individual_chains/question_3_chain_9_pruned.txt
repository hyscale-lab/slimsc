Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I know that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator, which is the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh, and the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate of the state multiplied by the operator, acting on the state. Mathematically, that's ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

First, I should probably find the expectation value of σz and σx separately, then combine them with their coefficients.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I think I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

Let me start with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ should be straightforward.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Okay, that's the ⟨σz⟩. Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x operator, which I think has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value using the definition.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. Expanding ψ: ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

σx acts on |↑⟩ as |↓⟩ and |↓⟩ as |↑⟩, because σx swaps the states. So σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So σx |ψ⟩ = a σx |↑⟩ + b σx |↓⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate of ψ dotted with σx|ψ⟩.

Wait, but ψ is given in terms of eigenstates of σz. Let me write ψ as a column vector. For spin-½ systems, |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is the matrix multiplied by the vector. Let me compute that:

σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ].

So now, ψ† σx ψ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx ψ. But since ψ has real coefficients here, I can ignore the conjugation part.

So, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

The inner product is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Wait, let me compute that:

First term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Adding them together: (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Oh no, wait, because the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σx acting on ψ. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternative approach: using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx has matrix elements ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = 1 and ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = 1. The diagonal elements are zero because σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = 0.

So the expectation value is a b* (1) + a* b (1) = 2 Re(a b*).

Since a=0.5 and b=(sqrt(3)/2), let's compute a b*:

a b* = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3)/4.

The real part is the same, so 2 * Re( a b* ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2, which is same as before. So that's correct.

Wait, but why is that the case? Oh because the off-diagonal terms in σx contribute, and the diagonal gives zero. So the expectation value is indeed sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait, could the expectation value of σx be larger than 1? Because the eigenvalues of σx are ±1, and the expectation value can't be more than 1, right? Oh, wait no, because σx is an operator with eigenvalues ±1, but the expectation value depends on the state. Wait, but sqrt(3)/2 is around 0.866, which is less than 1, so that seems okay.

Hmm, but let me think again: for the state given, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The probability of being in |↑⟩ is 0.25, and |↓⟩ is 0.75. So the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expectation value of σx in this state might be something else. Let me think about it again. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the expectation value formula in terms of the state's components.

Another method: The expectation value of σx is given by 2 Re(a b*), as I thought earlier. So with a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2, a b* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So 2 times that is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So that seems correct.

Now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx.

So the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0
