Okay, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> is a coherent state, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states because the Wigner function is Gaussian. So when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the state becomes non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity is measured using the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a reference Gaussian state.

The measure given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference. Wait, but I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum relative entropy) is calculated with respect to the closest Gaussian state. So tau would be the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense, maybe the maximum likelihood estimate or something like that.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The relative entropy measure here is del_b, and higher values would indicate higher non-Gaussianity. Because if rho is Gaussian, then tau would be the same as rho and del_b would be zero. So if the state is more non-Gaussian, del_b will be positive.

Now, the parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug in the numbers. So phi is -pi/4, which is -45 degrees or 315 degrees, but in radians, it's about -0.7854. Cos(phi) would be cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) which is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

Wait, but in the state, it's sin(phi)|-alpha>, so the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi). So when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is positive and sin is negative. So the state becomes (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5>)/N.

What's N? The normalization constant is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let's compute that.

First, compute sin(2 phi). 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5). So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2 phi)*exp(-2 alpha^2) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (0.7071|0.5> -0.7071| -0.5>)/0.6275.

Wait, but the state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, so they are kind of the "classical" states in quantum optics. A superposition of two coherent states, like this, would lead to a non-Gaussian state, right? Because the Wigner function would have interference terms, making it non-Gaussian.

Now, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using relative entropy. So I need to find the density matrix rho of |psi> and compare it to a Gaussian state tau. But what's the reference Gaussian state tau? I think it's the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho, because the maximum likelihood Gaussian estimate would match the first and second moments.

Wait, the maximum likelihood Gaussian approximation (MLGA) is often used as the reference. The idea is that for any state, you can approximate it with a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments. So, tau would be that Gaussian state.

So, to compute del_b, I need to calculate S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Wait, no, the expression is trace(rho ln rho) is the entropy of rho, and similarly for tau. So del_b is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But wait, another thought: relative entropy typically is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But the question says del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy. Hmm, that's not the standard relative entropy, but perhaps it's the difference in the entropies of the two states.

So, to calculate this, I need to find rho and tau, compute their entropies, and subtract.

But wait, rho is the state provided, and tau is the Gaussian state that best approximates it. Alternatively, for a state that is a superposition, the reference Gaussian might just be a thermal state or a coherent state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian is the maximum likelihood Gaussian state, which would be the state that has the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments completely determine the state.

So, to find tau, the reference Gaussian state, we need to compute the first and second moments (like mean
