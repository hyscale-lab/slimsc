Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about that part. Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with electric potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. Since the system is isolated, energy considerations like potential energy are key here.

Wait, the charges are identical. So each has a charge of 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is fixed, so maybe it's the central charge, and the others are arranged around it. But wait, the 12 charges are each 2 m away from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters from the 13th charge at P.

Wait, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because if those 12 are all at 2 m from P, are they arranged in some way that affects their mutual potential energy? Or is the problem only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the others?

Hmm, the question says it's the minimum energy of the system. So I need to consider all pairwise interactions, I think.

So let's think about the potential energy contributions:

1. The energy between the central charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges around it.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

But wait, wait. The problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. But their mutual distances depend on how they
