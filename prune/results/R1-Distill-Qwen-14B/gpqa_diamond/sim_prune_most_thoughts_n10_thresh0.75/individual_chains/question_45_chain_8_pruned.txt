Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in such wells, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the square of the quantum number.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states, right? But wait, wait. Oh, right, because for identical particles, their overall wavefunction must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions (spin-1/2), the total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles.

But wait, the particles are in a 1D well, so their spatial wavefunction and spin wavefunction combine to make an antisymmetric overall wavefunction. So the total wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts. Since the spin part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, the spatial part must compensate to make the overall antisymmetric.

So for four particles, each with spin 1/2, the spin state has to be considered. Let me think: the spin states can form different configurations. For four particles, the spin state must be symmetric or antisymmetric. Wait, no, actually, the spin part can be either symmetric or antisymmetric, and the spatial part must have the opposite symmetry.

Wait, for four identical fermions, their combined spin state can have a certain symmetry, and the spatial wavefunction must have the opposite. So if the spin part is symmetric, the spatial part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

So the ground state would be the lowest possible energy when the spatial part is as low as possible, but considering the symmetry constraints. Let's think about how to arrange the particles in the well.

In a 1D infinite potential well, each particle's energy is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, since E is given as π² ħ²/(2mL²).

Each particle can occupy a quantum state with a specific n value, but for fermions, no two can have the same quantum state (same n and spin). Wait, but wait, in a 1D box, each energy level (each n) has a single state because the spatial wavefunction is determined by n. But wait, no, wait: for particles with spin, each spatial state can have two possible spin states. Oh wait, no, because in a 1D box, the spatial part is non-degenerate except for spin. So each n can have two possible spin states: spin up or spin down.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, in 1D, the energy levels are non-degenerate, meaning each n corresponds to only one spatial state. So each spatial state can be combined with either spin up or spin down. So each (n, spin) combination is a unique state.

So for four fermions, we need to assign them to the lowest possible n's, considering that each n can have up to two particles (each with opposite spins). So let's list the possible states.

In the ground state, the four particles must fill up the lowest possible states without violating the Pauli exclusion principle.

So the lowest energy is when each n is used as much
