Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I think that's a norbornene structure with a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, right? So the structure might look like a bridged bicyclic system with that substituent.

Next, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when combined with dibromomethyl groups, it might lead to some kind of elimination or coupling. Oh, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But wait, the dibromomethyl groups have two leaving groups. Maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of substitution.

Wait, the starting material has a diene (the norbornene part) and the other molecule is a dienophile? No, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a diene itself. Hmm, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) suggests that there are two groups at positions 5 and 6, each with a bromine and a methyl. So maybe it's a dienophile with two leaving groups.

Wait, another thought: using sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent would probably lead to an SN2 reaction. But the molecule has two bromides, so maybe each reacts. So each dibromomethyl group could lose a bromide, perhaps substituting with something.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene. So when it reacts with dienophile, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder. But the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, a cyclohexa-1,3-diene is
