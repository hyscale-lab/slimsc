Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that in the CERN Bubble Chamber, a decay occurs where a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to their velocity relative to the observer. That's time dilation from special relativity. The formula for the observed lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, right?

So, the Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. Wait, but wait, is E the total energy? Or is it the kinetic energy? I think in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy, not just the kinetic. So I'll go with E being the total energy.

Given that, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So approximately, 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91 or so. Let me get more precise. Let's do 27 ÷ 3.41.

Well, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 - 23.87 = 3.13. So 3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.918. So total is about 7.918. So γ ≈ 7.918.

Then the observed lifetime τ is γ * τ₀. So τ ≈ 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7 * 8e-16 is 5.6e-15, and 0.918 * 8e-16 is about 7.344e-16. So adding those, 5.6e-15 is 56e-16, plus 7.344e-16 gives 63.344e-16 s. So τ ≈ 6.3344e-15 s. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 8e-16 * 7.918 is 8 *7.918 = 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 s. Yes.

Now, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think this relates to the number of particles that decay within the bubble chamber before they fly away beyond the resolution, so that the chamber can detect them.

Wait, the Bubble Chamber's resolution probably refers to the minimum distance over which the decay products can be detected. So the particles are moving at high speeds, and if the decay happens too far away, the chamber can't resolve the exact point. So the idea is that the decay must occur within a certain length so that the products are detected. So the decay length is the distance a particle travels during its lifetime as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, so the decay length L is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ. But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds, so v is approximately c, the speed of light. So L ≈ c * τ.

But wait, I need to find the minimum resolution (the minimum L that needs to be detected as a decay point). The question says, what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so perhaps I should be considering the particles that decay within a certain length, and we want that 30% of the decays are within that length. Or perhaps it's more about the fraction of particles that decay within the bubble chamber's volume, which depends on the decay length.

Wait, maybe it's about the particles decaying in the Bubble Chamber. The resolution would need to be able to detect the decay points; so if the decay happens too far, perhaps the chamber can't accurately pinpoint the position, or the tracks are too spread out. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance over which the decay occurs, so that 30% of the particles decay within that distance.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's about the decay length. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The probability that a particle decays within a certain length L is given by the decay probability P = 1 - e^(-L/(cτ)). Wait, no, the decay probability is given by 1 - e^(-t/τ), but since t = L / c, it's 1 - e^(-L/(cτ)).

In this problem, I think we need to find the length L such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that length. So we set P = 0.3. Wait, no: 30% of the particles decay within that length. So P = 0.3. So we can set up the equation 0.3 = 1 - e^(-L/(cτ)).

Wait, but wait, that would mean the probability that a decay occurs within L is 30%, so 1 - e^(-L/(cτ)) = 0.3. Let's solve for L.

So 1 - 0.3 = e^(-L/(cτ)) → 0.7 = e^(-L/(cτ)).

Take natural log on both sides: ln(0.7) = - L/(cτ).

So L = cτ * (- ln(0.7)).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

So L = cτ * 0.35667.

Wait, but let me compute it correctly. So since 0.7 is less than 1, the ln is negative. So - ln(0.7) is positive. So L = cτ * (ln(1/0.7)) ) → cτ * ln(10/7) ≈ cτ * 0.35667.

So L = c * τ * 0.35667.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(1/0.3), no, wait, no. Wait, the decay probability P is the probability that a decay occurs before a certain time, which in
