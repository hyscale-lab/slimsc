Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably a 1:1 complex since it's stoichiometric. So the formula might be something like CaY^2- or CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, the formation constant, Kf, is given. I think Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and we're assuming that the pH is ideal. I think that under ideal pH conditions, the EDTA is in its proper form, which is the deprotonated form required for complex formation. So I don't have to worry about the alpha fraction here.

So, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means that initially, before any dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But in solution, some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. Since Kf is very large (5x10^10), that means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions will be very low.

Let's set up the equation. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- ; Kf = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So the Kf is [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]).

In this case, the complex is 0.02 M, but once it dissociates, it's going to produce Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, let's think about the initial situation. The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Let's assume that the complex is dissociating a little, so:

Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But since Kf is so large (5e10), x should be really small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²) ) = 5e10.

So I can write:

0.02 / x² = 5e10

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

So x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, that's 2e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo
