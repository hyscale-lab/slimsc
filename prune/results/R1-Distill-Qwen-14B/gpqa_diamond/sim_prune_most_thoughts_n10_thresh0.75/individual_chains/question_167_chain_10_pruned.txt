Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. The problem gives me a specific state and asks me to find the non-Gaussianity measure, which is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a Gaussian reference state's density matrix.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N, where N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So first, I should probably compute N for these values.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. So sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25))= exp(-0.5) which is approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935), which is about 0.627. But wait, the normalization constant is in the denominator of the state, so |psi> is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] divided by N.

Wait, but when I compute the density matrix rho for |psi>, it's |psi><psi|. So rho would be (1/N²) times [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] times [cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ].

Expanding that, it becomes (1/N²)[ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ] ].

Hmm, but the reference state tau is a Gaussian state. For a two-mode state or a single-mode? Wait, the state |alpha> is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian. The reference state tau is likely the closest Gaussian state to rho. But I'm a bit fuzzy on what exactly the reference Gaussian state is in this context. Oh, perhaps the reference is the state that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the Gaussian state closest in some sense to rho.

Alternatively, I remember that for a state that's a superposition of coherent states, the closest Gaussian state might be the one with the same first and second moments. So for the state |psi>, the first moment is the expectation value of the annihilation operator a. Let's compute that.

The density matrix rho is (1/N²) [ |alpha><alpha| cos^2(phi) + | -alpha><-alpha| sin^2(phi) + ... cross terms ].

The expectation value of a in rho is Tr(rho a) = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a | -alpha > + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha|a| -alpha> + < -alpha|a| alpha> ] ].

Wait, coherent states have expectation values <alpha| a |alpha> = alpha. Similarly, < -alpha | a | -alpha > = - alpha. So the first term is cos^2(phi) * alpha, the second is sin^2(phi) * (-alpha), and then the cross terms.

What about the cross terms: <alpha|a| -alpha>? Coherent states are eigenstates of a, so <alpha| a |beta> = beta <alpha|beta>. So <alpha|
