Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. 

First, let's break down the information given.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it's an aromatic compound. The IR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a key point—there's an ester functional group present.

Looking at the ¹H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's categorize them:
1. Two aromatic protons: So the ring has two types of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, perhaps they are in ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, but two signals mean maybe two distinct environments. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring might have two sets of equivalent protons. Or maybe one substituent is in such a position that the protons split into two different environments. Hmm, not entirely sure yet, but I'll come back to this.

2. Two vinyl protons: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond. So maybe there's an ester group attached? Because esters can have an adjacent double bond, like in an aromatic ester.

Wait, esters are usually R-O-C-O-R, but more accurately, the structure is RCOOR'. Oh wait, no, that's an ester. So the ester group is usually -O-CO-O-, but wait, no. Wait, the structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if the ring is substituted with an ester group, perhaps like a benzyl ester?

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl protons. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH-, but in this case, perhaps the substituent has a double bond. Let me think. For example, if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like maybe an allyl ester or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyclic ester with a double bond nearby.

Wait,
