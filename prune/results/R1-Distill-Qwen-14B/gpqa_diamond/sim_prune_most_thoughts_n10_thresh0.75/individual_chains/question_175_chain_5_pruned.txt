Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're asked to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the form of f.

Wait, the options give possible forms for f and the fraction. So first, I think I need to recall some antenna radiation patterns and how the power distribution depends on angle.

I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is symmetric around its axis (the z-axis here), and the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) depends on the angle theta. The formula I think is something like I = (something) * sin^2(theta), right? Because the maximum is when theta is 90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum is at theta = 90 degrees. But in this case, the charge distribution is oscillating, which makes me think of it as a radiating dipole.

But wait, the problem says it's spheroidal. Spheroidal charge distributions are a bit different than dipoles. Oh wait, a dipole is a limiting case of certain charge distributions, but maybe the radiation pattern is similar. Or perhaps spheroidal implies an elliptical shape, but I'm not sure how that affects the radiation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more general. Let me think about the properties of radiation.

The power radiated by an accelerating charge depends on the acceleration and the dipole moment. But when it's oscillating, it's like a dipole antenna.

In the far field (radiation zone), the electric and magnetic fields fall off as 1/r, and the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is given by the Poynting vector.

For a dipole antenna, the intensity (power per solid angle) as a function of theta is (something) * sin^2(theta), and the maximum occurs at theta = 90
