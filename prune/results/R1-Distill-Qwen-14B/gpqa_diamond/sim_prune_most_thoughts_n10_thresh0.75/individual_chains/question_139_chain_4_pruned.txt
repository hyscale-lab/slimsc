Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, so the reagents involved are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Wait, I remember that when amines react with nitrous acid (which is formed from NaNO2 and HCl), it leads to various products depending on the conditions. For primary aromatic amines, it might form diazonium salts, but that's usually under cold conditions and in the presence of something else like Cu. But wait, if the starting material is a secondary amine, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps it's not an amine at all.

Wait a second, another thought. The reagents HCl, NaNO2, and water are used in the production of carbonyl compounds. Oh yeah, I think this is the Stephen reduction or maybe the Beckmann rearrangement. No, wait, Beckmann is with oximes and H2SO4. Oh, right! There's the reaction where an alcohol is treated with nitrous acid and HCl, leading to the formation of a ketone or aldehyde. Oh wait, that's the Stephen reduction?

Wait, no. Let me think. If you have a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group, like an alcohol that's in a position where on treatment with nitrous acid, it can undergo some kind of elimination followed by rearrangement. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl via the elimination of a hydroxylamine or something.

Wait, another angle. The product is a diketone. So, each starting material A and B, when treated with these reagents, forms a diketone. So, the product has two ketone groups.

So, the starting material must have a structure that, upon treatment, forms two ketones. How can that happen? Maybe the starting material has two hydroxyl groups adjacent to each other or in positions where elimination can form two carbonyls.

Wait, wait. Oh! I think I remember the production of diketones from diols. If you have a diol (vicinal diol, maybe), treatment with nitrous acid
