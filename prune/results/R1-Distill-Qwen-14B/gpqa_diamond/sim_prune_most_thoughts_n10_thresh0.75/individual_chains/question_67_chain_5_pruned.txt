Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem involves two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, that notation must mean |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum and M is its z-component.

Wait, but wait a second. When you couple two angular momenta, the possible total L values are l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2| in integer steps. So l1 and l2 are both 1, so L can be 2, 1, 0. Oh, but in the state given, L is 2. So that's the maximum possible, which makes sense because 1+1=2.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z, which are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. The possible eigenvalues for each are m times ħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. So for each, m can be -1, 0, +1.

The problem asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ each. So each measurement gives -ħ. So both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but in the coupled state, the total M is given as -1. Because the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so M is -1. Wait, M is the z-component of the total angular momentum, which is L = L1 + L2. So Lz = L1z + L2z. So M = m1 + m2.

In this case, M = -1, so m1 + m2 = -1. But the problem is asking for the case where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because if m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, then M would be -2. But wait, in the state given, M is -1. So that can't happen. So if the state is |L=
