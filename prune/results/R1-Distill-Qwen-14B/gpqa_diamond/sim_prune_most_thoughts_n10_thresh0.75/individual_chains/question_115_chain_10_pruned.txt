Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are annihilating, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I think I'll need to apply conservation laws here.

Wait, but how does the annihilation work? Oh right, an electron and positron annihilate into two photons because it's impossible for a single photon to be produced (since momentum must be conserved, and a single photon can't have zero momentum). So two photons make sense.

Now, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. That means their energies E1 and E2 are equal. So E1 = E2 = E_photon.

Since the electrons and positrons are moving along the horizontal axis, which I'll take as the x-axis. So initially, the electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

Wait, but the Lorentz factors are given. Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²) for each particle. So I can find their energies and momenta.

Let me jot down the knowns:

Electron: 
- Moving from left (right direction), so velocity v_e is positive along x.
- Lorentz factor gamma_e =4.
Mass m_e is the electron mass, m_e c² is the rest energy.

Positron:
- Moving from right (so velocity v_p is negative along x), gamma_p=2.
Mass m_p is same as electron mass, m_e.

Wait, but positron has the same mass as electron, right? Since it's the antimatter counterpart.

So, the initial momentum of the electron (let's call it p_e) is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, but in which direction? Let me think about the sign.

Electron is moving to the right, so p_e is positive. Positron is moving to the left, so its momentum p_p is negative.

Wait, but the positron's velocity is negative, so its momentum would be gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Since v_p is negative, p_p would be negative.

Let me compute the momenta.

Wait, but I can express the momentum in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and gamma is related to velocity as beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c. Similarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

But wait, wait. For the electron, moving to the right, so beta_e is positive. For the positron, moving to the left, beta_p is negative.

So momentum p = gamma * m * beta * c. Wait, no. Momentum is gamma * m * v. Since v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. Alternatively, p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, for the electron:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c. Wait, wait, beta_e is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. So beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 * c.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c^2 )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, p = gamma m v. So v = beta c.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * (beta_e c) = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.

Plugging in the numbers:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4.

So p_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly for the positron:

gamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(1 -1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. But since it's moving to the left, beta_p is negative.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2) c = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Now, the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p.

p_initial = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, wait! Wait a second, because the positron is moving towards the left, so its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). Let me recompute.

p_initial = p_e + p_p = (m_e sqrt(15) c) + (- m_e sqrt
