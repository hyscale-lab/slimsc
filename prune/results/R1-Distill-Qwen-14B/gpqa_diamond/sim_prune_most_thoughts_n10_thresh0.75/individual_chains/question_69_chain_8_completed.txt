Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, right, I remember that particle physics involves a lot of decay processes and lifetimes. The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is 8e-16 seconds. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, right?

The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, resolution refers to the ability to distinguish between two close points, I think. In particle detectors like bubble chambers, the resolution is often the smallest distance that can be measured. So, to observe the decay products, the chamber must be able to resolve the tracks from Y⁺ and Z⁻. But how does that translate into the minimum resolution required?

Oh, right! The proper lifetime is the time the particle lives in its own frame, but when it's moving at high speeds, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame (like the bubble chamber) is longer due to time dilation. So, the actual lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh, wait, the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So, E = gamma * m. Therefore, gamma = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is about 7.917.

So the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. That would be 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.917 *8 is approximately 63.336, so 63.336e-16 s. Wait, or to be exact, 7.917 *8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Wait, wait, no, 7.917 *8 is 63.336, so 63.336e-16 is 6.3336e-15 seconds? Wait, no, 8e-16 multiplied by 7.917 would be (8*7.917) * 1e-16 = 63.336e-16 s. Which is 6.3336e-15 s? Or wait, 63.336e-16 is the same as 6.3336e-15. Yeah.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.3336e-15 seconds.

But how does this relate to the resolution? I think I remember something about the minimum distance the decay products need to travel for the chamber to detect them. The particle X⁰ is moving, and it decays into Y and Z. The distance the decay products move before the chamber can resolve them probably depends on the lifetime and the speed of the particle.

Wait, another approach: The distance a particle travels before decaying is L = v * tau. But wait, in high-energy physics, the mean path (Lorentz factor times c times tau_0) is often used. Because for a particle moving at relativistic speeds, L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

But wait, I think I should compute the velocity of the particle. How? Well, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, which is the total energy. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so the kinetic energy is E - m c². But wait, perhaps I should compute beta, which is v/c.

Gamma is E/(m c²), which is 27 /3.41 ≈7.917 as I calculated before.

Beta can be found from gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So solving for beta:

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2) → 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 = 1 – 1/(gamma^2). Let's compute that.

Gamma is approximately 7.917, so gamma squared is about 62.7. So 1/gamma squared is about 0.016. So 1 – 0.016 is 0.984. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.984) is roughly 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992, meaning the particle is moving at about 99.2% the speed of light.

Wait, but another approach is to compute beta from E, m. Alternatively, since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2)/(c). Then, beta is (pc²)/(E). Let me try that.

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So, (E)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute beta as beta = (pc²)/(E). So, first find p.

p = sqrt( (E^2) - (m c^2)^2 ) / c². Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of units. Let me use natural units where c=1, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of dimensionless units.

E = gamma m c^2, p = gamma m v, where v is beta c. So, beta = v/c.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So, beta = (pc²) / E → because p = (gamma m v) and E = gamma m c², so beta = (gamma m v c) / (gamma m c^2) ) → v/(c) = beta.

So, beta = (pc²)/E → but p is sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c → so beta = [ sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c * c² ] / E → [ sqrt(E² - m² c^4) * c ] / E.

Simplify:

beta = [ c * sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) ] / E.

But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps I should just compute it numerically.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So,

E² = (27)^2 = 729 (GeV)^2.

(m c^2)^2 = (3.41)^2 ≈ 11.63 (GeV)^2.

So, E² - (m c²)^2 = 729 - 11.63 = 717.37 (GeV)^2.

So, sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(717.37) ≈ 26.78 GeV.

Then, beta = [26.78 GeV * c ] / (27 GeV ) = (26.78 /27 ) * c ≈ 0.992 c.

So beta is approximately 0.992, same as before. So v is about 0.992c.

Now, the proper lifetime is tau_0 =8e-16 s.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0 = 7.917 *8e-16 = 6.3336e-15 s.

But the particle is moving at velocity v = beta c, so the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * tau = beta c tau.

Wait, no, because tau is the dilated lifetime. So, the average distance the particle travels before decaying is L = beta c tau.

So L = beta * c * tau.

Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

beta is 0.992 → so beta c ≈0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

tau is 6.3336e-15 s.

So L ≈ 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s = Let's compute:

2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = multiply 2.976 *6.3336 first.

2.976 *6.3336 ≈ let's approximate:

2.976 *6 = 17.856; 2.976 *0.3336 ≈ 0.992. So total approx 18.848.

So 18.848e-7 meters → 1.8848e-6 meters.

Wait, because 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. So 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = (2.976 *6.3336) * 1e-7 = (approx 18.848) *1e-7 = 1.8848e-6 meters, which is 1.8848 micrometers.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think this relates to the idea that the decay products (Y and Z) will be produced, and for the bubble chamber to resolve them, the distance between their tracks should be at least the resolution. But in a two-body decay, the two particles go in opposite directions. So the decay vertex is a point, but the particles fly off in opposite directions. The distance each travels before being detected would depend on their velocity and the time until they stop or interact.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. The problem is about the minimum distance the decay products must move apart for the chamber to detect them. If the decay occurs, and without a minimum separation, the chamber can't distinguish the two particles, so the detection wouldn't register the decay.

Alternatively, the resolution is the minimum distance that the decay products must be separated for them to be observed as two distinct tracks. So, the minimum resolution (delta) would be the length that the decay products have moved from the decay point, such that delta is the minimum for at least 30% of the decays to be observed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The particle has time to travel a certain distance before decaying. The mean path is L = c gamma beta tau_0.

Wait, another approach. The decay length is given by L = gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is the same as v tau, since v = beta c and tau = gamma tau_0.

So L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as gamma beta c tau_0.

So, L = gamma beta c tau_0.

Now, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps the decay length must be longer than the resolution for the decay to be observed.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how the 30% comes into play here. Maybe it relates to the fraction of decays that produce a separation greater than a certain length, which is the resolution. So perhaps we're looking for the length where 30% of the decays have a separation greater than that.

Wait, but in a 2-body decay, the two particles emitted back-to-back. The separation would be twice the distance each travels (since they go in opposite directions). Hmm, but maybe for the purposes of this question, the relevant distance is the same as the decay length L we calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is L. So, for the bubble chamber to detect the decay, the decay must occur within a certain volume such that the tracks of the decay products are separated by at least the resolution delta.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the proper way is to calculate the decay length L as the distance the X⁰ travels before decaying, and the minimum resolution would be a fraction of this L. So, to capture at least 30% of the decays, the resolution delta must be such that the probability of the decay products being separated by at least delta is >=30%.

Wait, but perhaps it's simpler than that. The resolution delta must be less than or equal to the average decay length L multiplied by a certain factor. Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance that the particle travels, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. The mean speed is beta c. So the mean decay length is L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is what I calculated earlier to be approximately 1.8848e-6 meters, or 1.88 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be such that the decay products are separated by at least that much in at least 30% of the cases.

Wait, but in a two-body decay, the particles Y and Z are emitted in opposite directions. So the separation between their tracks would be 2L, but I think that's not the case because each one is moving away from the decay point. Wait, no, the decay length is L, so each would have moved L away from the decay point in opposite directions, making their separation 2L. But perhaps the problem is considering the distance each particle travels, so maybe we just take L as the distance each has gone, and the resolution is the minimum delta to capture that.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution required is the decay length L, because if the chamber can resolve particles that have moved at least L away, then the decay can be observed.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper approach is to look at the decay length and relate it to the resolution. The resolution is the smallest distance the chamber can measure. So, for the decay to be observed, the decay products must be separated by at least the resolution delta. So, the probability that the decay products are separated by a distance greater than delta is the fraction observed.

But in a two-body decay, the products are emitted in opposite directions, so their separation is 2L. Wait, but for each decay, the separation is 2L, so if the chamber can resolve a minimum delta, then as long as 2L > delta, the decay can be observed. But perhaps the problem is considering that the minimum delta is L, so that the decay is visible when the products are at least L apart on each side.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay length L is the distance the X⁰ travels before decaying. So, the decay products are emitted from that point, but perhaps the chamber can only resolve the decay if the products have moved a certain distance.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution delta is the distance that the X⁰ travels before decaying, which is L. So, the chamber must have a resolution at least L to detect the decay. If the resolution is smaller than L, more decays can be observed, but if it's larger, fewer can be observed.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps the resolution must be greater than or equal to a certain value to capture that fraction of decays.

Wait, maybe this involves the concept of the decay probability as a function of distance. The number of decays observed would be proportional to the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length multiplied by a certain factor. Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let me think again: the X⁰ is moving with speed v, lifetime tau. The mean distance it travels before decaying is L = v tau. So, the probability that the decay occurs within a certain distance x is given by the exponential decay law: P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/L}.

So, for a given x, the probability that the decay occurs within x is P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/(L)}.

We need to find the minimum x such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, set P(x) = 0.3.

0.3 = 1 - e^{-x/L} → e^{-x/L} = 0.7 → take natural log on both sides: -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = - L ln(0.7).

Compute ln(0.7): approx -0.35667.

So x = L * 0.35667.

So the minimum resolution delta is x = 0.35667 * L.

Wait, but wait: the resolution is the minimum distance that the decay products are separated. So, if the decay occurs within x, then the chamber can detect it. So the minimum x needed to catch 30% of decays is x = L * ln( (1 - 0.3)/0.3 )? Wait, I might have messed up the formula.

Wait, earlier I had P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/L}.

We set P(x) = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^{-x/L} → e^{-x/L} = 0.7 → take ln: -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = L * (- ln (0.7)).

ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, so x = L * 0.35667.

So the minimum x is about 35.667% of L.

Now, L is 1.8848e-6 m.

So x = 0.35667 * 1.8848e-6 m → let me compute that.

0.35667 *1.8848e-6 ≈ ?

1.8848e-6 * 0.35667 ≈ (1.8848 *0.35667 )e-6.

1.8848 *0.35667: 1.88 *0.35 is about 0.658, and 0.0048 *0.35667 is about 0.0017. So total approximately 0.6597.

So x ≈0.6597e-6 m → 6.597e-7 m → about 6.6e-7 m, which is 0.66 micrometers.

But none of the options are 0.66e-6 m. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 2.08e-6 m
B) 2.08e-9 m
C) 2.08e-1 m
D) 2.08e-3 m

Hmm, none are exactly 0.66e-6. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the minimum resolution delta is the length L such that 30% of the decays have a separation greater than delta. So, P(x>delta) =0.3.

In that case, the probability P(x>delta) is e^{-delta/L}= 0.3.

So, e^{-delta/L}=0.3 → take ln: -delta/L = ln(0.3) → delta = -L ln(0.3).

Compute ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397. So delta = L * 1.20397.

So delta ≈1.204 * L.

Our L was approximately 1.8848e-6 m.

So delta ≈1.204 *1.8848e-6 → Let me compute this.

1.8848e-6 *1.204 ≈:

1.8848 *1.204 ≈ approx 2.27.

So delta ≈2.27e-6 meters.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. That's close to 2.27e-6. Perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of L.

Earlier, I calculated L as gamma beta c tau_0.

Gamma was 27/3.41 ≈7.917.

Beta was approximately 0.992.

So, gamma beta =7.917 *0.992 ≈7.865.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = gamma beta c tau_0 = 7.865 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute that:

7.865 *3 =23.595.

23.595 *8 =188.76.

So 188.76e-8 → 1.8876e-6 meters.

Ah, so L is approximately 1.8876e-6 m.

So delta =1.204 * L →1.204 *1.8876e-6 ≈ let's compute 1.8876e-6 *1.204.

1.8876 *1.204 ≈2.273.

So delta ≈2.273e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma or beta calculation.

Wait, let me recheck gamma and beta.

E =27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c^2) =27/3.41 ≈7.917.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E)^2 ) → sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) → sqrt(1 -0.01595) → sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.992. So beta is about 0.992.

So gamma beta is 7.917 *0.992 ≈7.865.

So L = gamma beta c tau_0 =7.865 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

7.865 *3e8 =2.3595e9.

2.3595e9 *8e-16 = (2.3595 *8 )e(9-16) → 18.876e-7 →1.8876e-6 m.

So L=1.8876e-6 m.

So for P(x>delta)=0.3, delta = L * (-ln(0.3)) → L *1.20397 →1.8876e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.273e-6 m.

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps there's a more precise calculation of gamma and beta.

Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

Gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 3.41 *7.917 = let's compute 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.917 ≈3.41*(0.9+0.017)=3.069 +0.05797=3.12697. So 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697. So 7.917 *3.41≈27. So gamma is 7.917.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.41 *0.917 ≈3.13 → because 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41 *0.017=0.05797 → total 3.12697.

So 3.12697 is very close to 3.13. So 3.41 *7.917≈27. So gamma is exactly 7.917.

Then beta was calculated as approximately 0.992.

Wait, more accurately, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) → m c² =3.41 GeV, E=27 GeV.

So (3.41/27)^2 = (0.1263)^2 ≈0.01595.

So 1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.9920.

So beta is 0.9920.

So gamma beta is 7.917 *0.9920= let's compute precisely.

7 *0.9920=6.944.

0.917 *0.9920= let's compute:

0.9 *0.9920= 0.8928.

0.017 *0.9920=0.016864.

So total 0.8928+0.016864=0.909664.

So 7 *0.9920=6.944, plus 0.917 *0.9920=0.909664 → total gamma beta=6.944 +0.909664=7.853664.

So gamma beta=7.853664.

Then, L=gamma beta c tau_0 =7.853664 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute step by step:

7.853664 *3e8 =23.560992e8 =2.3560992e9.

2.3560992e9 *8e-16 = (2.3560992 *8 )e(9-16) → 18.8487936e-7 →1.88487936e-6 m.

So L≈1.88488e-6 m.

Then delta (minimum resolution) is delta = L * (-ln(0.3)) → L *1.20397.

So delta =1.88488e-6 *1.20397 → let me compute:

1.88488e-6 *1.20397 = ?

1.88488 *1.20397 ≈ let's compute:

1 *1.20397=1.20397.

0.8 *1.20397=0.963176.

0.08 *1.20397=0.0963176.

0.00488 *1.20397≈0.005875.

Adding all:

1.20397 + 0.963176 = 2.167146.

2.167146 +0.0963176=2.263463.

2.263463 +0.005875=2.269338.

So approx 2.2693e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, but my calculation is about 2.27e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the proper lifetime tau_0, and the observed lifetime tau.

Wait, the formula for the decay length is L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s, but when calculating the decay length, I'm using tau_0, but perhaps I should be using tau=gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, L=gamma beta c tau_0 → which is the same as beta c tau, where tau=gamma tau_0.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is L=beta c tau, and tau=gamma tau_0.

So L=beta c gamma tau_0 = gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is what I used earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the resolution required is the mean decay length L multiplied by a certain factor. For example, to capture a certain percentage of decays.

Wait, another approach: the problem asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, the resolution delta is the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying, such that 30% of the decays are observed beyond that point. Wait, no, more precisely, the resolution is the smallest distance that the decay products are separated, and we need at least 30% of the decays to have that separation. So, the minimum delta is the value such that P(x >=delta) =0.3.

In the exponential decay law, P(x >= delta) = e^{-delta/L}.

So, set e^{-delta/L} =0.3 → delta= -L ln(0.3) → delta= L *1.20397.

So, delta=1.20397 * L.

Which, as before, gives delta ≈2.27e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma or beta.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of gamma and beta.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 = approximately 7.917.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² /E )²) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So gamma beta =7.917 *0.9920=7.853.

Then, L= gamma beta c tau_0 =7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.853 *3 =23.559, 23.559 *8=188.472.

So 188.472e-8 m →1.88472e-6 m.

So L=1.8847e-6 m.

So delta = L * 1.20397 →1.8847e-6 *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the minimum resolution to be L itself, not considering the 30% factor. Because if that's the case, delta would be approximately 1.88e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m).

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So if the resolution is L, then the probability of observing a decay is P(x>=L) =e^{-L/L}=e^{-1}≈0.3679, which is about 36.8%. So that's more than 30%, so the resolution could be a bit lower than L to have at least 30% observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decay products have a separation greater than that. So, finding the delta where P(x>=delta)=0.3, which leads to delta= L *1.20397.

But in that case, the delta would be about 2.27e-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Let me compute L precisely.

Gamma =27 /3.41 → 3.41 is 3.4100.

27 /3.4100 = let's compute:

3.41 *7=23.87.

27 -23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 =0.9179.

So, 7.9179.

Beta: (3.41/27 )=0.1263.

So, 1 - (0.1263)^2 =1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920.

Gamma beta=7.9179 *0.9920=7.853.

Then, L=7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.853*3=23.559.

23.559 *8=188.472.

188.472e-8 m →1.88472e-6 m.

So delta=1.88472e-6 *1.20397= let's compute:

1.88472 *1.20397 ≈2.268e-6 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps the problem expects delta to be the mean decay length multiplied by a factor, or perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the mean decay length and uses that as the resolution.

In that case, delta= L=1.884e-6 m. So the closest option would be option A (2.08e-6 m).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute delta as the proper lifetime's decay length, not considering gamma. But that would be L= beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s →0.992 * 2.4e-7 m → approx 2.38e-7 m, which is 0.238 micrometers. Not matching any option except B is 2.08e-9 m.

Wait, that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the calculation, or I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of delta.

delta= L *1.20397.

L=1.8847e-6 m.

So 1.8847e-6 *1.20397 = (1.8847)(1.20397) e-6.

Compute 1.8847 *1.20397.

Let me do this step by step.

1.8847 *1.2 = 2.26164.

1.8847 *0.00397 ≈ 0.00744.

So total is approximately 2.26164 +0.00744 =2.26908.

So delta≈2.269e-6 meters.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use beta c tau_0 as the L, and not considering gamma. Let's compute that.

Beta c tau_0=0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute:

0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

2.976e8 *8e-16=2.3808e-7 m.

Which is 0.238 micrometers. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to compute the mean decay length as L=gamma c tau_0.

Which would be gamma c tau_0=7.917 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.917 *3e8=2.3751e9 m/s.

2.3751e9 *8e-16=1.9e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9 micrometers. Option A is 2.08e-6 m. Close.

Wait, 7.917 *3e8 =2.3751e9.

2.3751e9 *8e-16= (2.3751 *8) *1e-7 →19.0008e-7 →1.90008e-6 m.

That's 1.90008e-6 meters, which is 1.9 micrometers.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. So perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be L=gamma c tau_0, without considering beta.

Wait, why would that be? Because in that case, L=gamma c tau_0.

But that would be incorrect because the actual distance is L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that beta is 1. So, beta=1.

If beta is taken as 1, then L=gamma c tau_0.

Gamma is 7.917.

So L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute:

7.917 *3e8=2.3751e9 m/s.

2.3751e9 *8e-16= (2.3751 *8) *1e-7 →19.0008e-7 →1.90008e-6 m.

Which is 1.90008e-6 m, matching approximately 1.9 micrometers. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the resolution is simply the decay length L=gamma beta c tau_0.

But according to precise calculations, that gives about 1.88e-6 m, which is 1.88 micrometers. So none of the options match exactly, but option A is the only one in the same order of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma beta.

Wait, let me compute gamma beta again.

E =27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

E^2 = (27)^2 =729.

(m c^2)^2= (3.41)^2=11.6281.

E^2 - (m c^2)^2 =729-11.6281=717.3719.

p = sqrt(717.3719) GeV/c → approx 26.783 GeV/c.

Then, beta = pc / E → (26.783 GeV/c * c ) /27 GeV →26.783 /27 ≈0.992.

So beta is 0.992.

Gamma= E/(m c^2)=27/3.41=7.917.

So gamma beta=7.917 *0.992=7.853.

So L=7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.853 *2.4e-7 m →7.853 *2.4=18.8472 →1.88472e-6 m.

So L=1.8847e-6 m, which is 1.8847 micrometers.

So, the minimum resolution is delta= L *1.204=2.27e-6 m.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution as L itself, which is about 1.88e-6 m.

But the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is larger than 1.88e-6.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exact value of gamma beta.

Compute gamma=27 /3.41.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13/3.41=0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992.

Gamma beta=7.917 *0.992=7.853.

So L=7.853 *3e8 *8e-16 →7.853 *24e-8 →7.853 *24=188.472 →188.472e-8=1.8847e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c.

Wait, perhaps c is taken as 3e8 m/s, which I've been using. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to compute L=gamma c tau_0 without considering beta.

So, L=gamma c tau_0 =7.917 *3e8 *8e-16 →7.917 *2.4e-7 →1.9e-6 m.

Which is option A: 2.08e-6 m. Close to 1.9e-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the decay length L to be gamma c tau_0, but that's not correct because beta isn't 1. So why would I get a different result?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake, and the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation, and I should look for another approach.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the time dilation factor is gamma=12.345, but I think I've calculated it correctly.

Wait, I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I've done and see which option is the closest.

In my calculation, delta is approximately 2.27e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the exact value of delta.

delta= L *1.20397.

L=1.8847e-6 m.

So, 1.8847e-6 *1.20397 = ?

Let me compute 1.8847 *1.20397.

Compute 1.8847 *1.2 = 2.26164.

1.8847 *0.00397 = 0.00743.

Adding them gives 2.26164 +0.00743=2.26907.

So, delta=2.26907e-6 m →2.269e-6 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the probability formula. Let me think again.

The probability that the decay occurs after traveling a distance x is P(x) = e^{-x/L}.

We want the fraction of decays where x >=delta to be 30%, so P(x>=delta) =0.3.

As before, delta = L * ln(1/0.3) → L *1.20397.

So, yes, the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe a separation of at least 30% of the mean decay length. So, delta=0.3 * L.

L=1.8847e-6 m → 0.5654e-6 m, which is 0.565 micrometers. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the mean decay length and that's the answer.

So, L=1.8847e-6 m, which is approximately 1.88e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the correct approach is to compute L=gamma beta c tau_0 and that's the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate gamma beta, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, E=27 GeV, m c^2=3.41 GeV.

E=gamma m c^2 → gamma=27/3.41≈7.917.

Beta=v/c= (pc)/(E) → p= sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2)/c → p= sqrt(729 -11.63)/c → sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c.

So, beta= (26.78 GeV/c * c )/27 GeV → 26.78/27≈0.99185.

So beta=0.99185.

So gamma beta=7.917 *0.99185≈7.853.

So, L=7.853 *3e8 *8e-16=7.853 *2.4e-7=1.8847e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a calculation that gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers.

If L=gamma beta c tau_0= 2.08e-6 m, then gamma beta c=2.08e-6 / (8e-16 s ) / (3e8 m/s) → let's compute that.

gamma beta = (2.08e-6 m) / (3e8 m/s *8e-16 s) ) → denominator is 2.4e-7 m.

So gamma beta=2.08e-6 /2.4e-7 → approx 8.6667.

So, gamma beta would have to be 8.6667.

But earlier, gamma beta was 7.853, which is less than 8.6667.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute gamma beta=8.6667.

Wait, but why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I should set L=delta=2.08e-6 m and solve for gamma beta.

2.08e-6 m = gamma beta c tau_0 → gamma beta= 2.08e-6 / (3e8 *8e-16 )=2.08e-6 / (2.4e-7)=8.6667.

So gamma beta=8.6667.

So, gamma beta=8.6667.

But earlier, gamma beta is 7.853, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate gamma =27/3.41=7.917, and then beta is taken as 1, leading to L=gamma c tau_0=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16=1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A.

But that's an approximation, and beta is actually 0.992, not 1.

Hmm.

At this point, considering the options and the calculations, the closest option to the calculated delta is option A) 2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and the relevant physical quantities.

### Key Information:
1. **Decay Process**: \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \)
2. **Proper Lifetime**: \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \)
3. **Energy in the Bubble Chamber**: \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \)
4. **Mass of \( X^0 \)**: \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \)
5. **Speed of Light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Velocity (\( \beta \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is determined using the relation:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m}{E}\right)^2}
\]
Substituting \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3.41}{27}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Decay Length (\( L \))
The decay length in the lab frame is given by:
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 7.917 \), \( \beta = 0.992 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 7.917 \cdot 0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16}
\]
First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):
\[
\gamma \beta = 7.917 \cdot 0.992 \approx 7.853
\]
Now calculate \( L \):
\[
L = 7.853 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 7.853 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.8848 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Minimum Resolution (\( \delta \))
To observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum resolution \( \delta \) corresponds to the distance where 30% of the decays occur. Using the exponential decay law:
\[
P(x \geq \delta) = e^{-\delta / L}
\]
Set \( P(x \geq \delta) = 0.3 \):
\[
0.3 = e^{-\delta / L} \implies \delta = -L \ln(0.3)
\]
Substitute \( L = 1.8848 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) and \( \ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397 \):
\[
\delta = 1.8848 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated minimum resolution \( \delta \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) is closest to **Option A: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
