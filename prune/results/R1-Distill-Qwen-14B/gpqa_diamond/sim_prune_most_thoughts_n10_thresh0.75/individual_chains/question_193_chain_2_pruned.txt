Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, right, parallax is inversely related to distance. So I remember that parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So if plx is small, the distance is large.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So it's about the relationship between the number of stars and distance. Let's break it down.

The number of stars, let's call it N, varies with 1/plx^5. So mathematically, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But wait, parallax plx is 1/d, where d is the distance. So substituting that in, N should be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, but wait a second. Wait, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So if I plug this into N, which is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I get N proportional to (d)^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, that suggests that as d increases, the number
