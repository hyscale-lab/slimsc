Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx equals 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, wait, wait. Parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, they want to know the dependence of N on r (distance). Let's think about this step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. Substituting, N is proportional to (d)^5. Wait, no. Wait, because 1/(plx)^5 is equal to (1/plx)^5. And since 1/plx is d, then 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, but the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range, so maybe it's about the differential, like the number within a shell between r and r + dr.

Alternatively, wait. Let's think about the cumulative number of stars up to a distance r. If N ∝ d^5, then the number within a small distance dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Oh wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Parallax plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that seems a lot. But let's think about the density of stars.

Wait, no. Wait a second, the number of stars in a certain region (like a volume) depends on how many are within a certain distance
