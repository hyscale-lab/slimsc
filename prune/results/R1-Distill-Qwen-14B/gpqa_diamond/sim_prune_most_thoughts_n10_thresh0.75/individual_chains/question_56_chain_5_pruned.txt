Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says that the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules for hydrogen... Right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δn = ±1, 0 and Δl = ±1, with Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, no, actually, for dipole transitions, the main selection rules are for the quantum numbers. Specifically, the electric dipole transition has selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, but the change in n, Δn, can be ±1 or 0? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think for hydrogen-like atoms, the electric dipole transitions require that Δl = ±1, and Δm can be 0, ±1. Also, the n can change by any integer, but in practice, for the hydrogen atom, transitions usually go between adjacent n levels because higher changes are less probable. Oh, but wait, in this case, the transition is from n=3 to n=1, so that's Δn = -2. So that's a change of two in n. Hmm, but wait, that's not possible with a single dipole transition. Because the dipole selection rule says Δn can be ±1, right? So a single dipole transition can't go from n=3 to n=1. But the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So it must involve two steps. So the first step could be from 3→2, then 2→1.

So the first transition would be from n=3, l=0 (since m=0) to n=2, and l would have to change by ±1, so l=1. Then the second transition goes from n=2, l=1 to n=1, but again, l must change by ±1. So from l=1, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state is l=0, so the second transition must be from l=1 to l=0.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1, m⟩, where m can be 0, ±1. Because Δm can be 0, ±1 for each transition.

Now, let's think about the possible paths. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition must go to a state with l=1, so m can be 0, 1, or -1. So possible first steps are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, from each of those, the next transition must go to n=1, l=0. Let's check what m values are possible in the second step.

Starting with the first option: if the first step is to |2,1,0⟩. Then from here, the second transition must change l by ±1, so l=0. So the second state is |1,0, m⟩. What are the possible m values for the second transition?

In the first transition, the change in m can be 0, ±1. So here, in the first transition, m went from 0 to 0. So in the second transition, from l=1, m=0, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So possible m values in the second state are 0, +1, or -1. But the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m must be 0. Thus, from |2,1,0⟩, can we reach |1,0,0⟩? Let's see: for the second transition, we'd need to have m in the next state as 0. So the change in m from 0 to 0 is allowed (Δm=0), so that's possible.

Another possibility: first transition to |2,1,1⟩. Then, from that state, the second transition must go to l=0. So the final state is |1,0, m⟩. Now, from m=1 in the intermediate state, can it go to m=0 in the final state? Because Δm can be ±1 or 0. Yes, so m=1 can go to m=0 (Δm=-1). But wait, wait. The first transition could have a Δm of +1 (from 0 to 1), and the second transition could have Δm of -1 (from 1 to 0). So that's allowed.
