Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometric representation. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think carefully.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as diagonal matrices. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is the same but with 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding these two should give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 scales everything down. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that a qubit can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent the state of a qubit, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. So, density matrices correspond to points in this space.

Wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right, any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each a 2x2 matrix. So, if I can express ρ in this form, then r would give me the coordinates.

Let me try that. The given ρ is [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ] because when you add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, you get I (the identity matrix), and then multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 0.5.

Expressing ρ as (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute this. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. Then, (I + r·σ)/2 would be:

(1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] + (1/2)( r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute each element. The (1,1) element would be (1/2)(1 + r_z). The (2,2) element is (1/2)(1 - r_z). The (1,2) and (2,1) elements would involve r_x, r_y, and possibly imaginary numbers.

But the given ρ has all off-diagonal elements zero. So, the off-diagonal terms in the expression above must be zero. Let me write the off-diagonal terms:

The (1,2) element is (1/2)(r_x - i r_y). Since our ρ has 0 here, this must be zero. So (1/2)(r_x - i r_y) = 0 implies r_x - i r_y = 0. Which would mean r_x = 0 and r_y = 0, because the only way for a complex number to be zero is if both real and imaginary parts are zero.

Wait, can r_x and r_y be non-zero if their combination is zero? Let's see: r_x must be
