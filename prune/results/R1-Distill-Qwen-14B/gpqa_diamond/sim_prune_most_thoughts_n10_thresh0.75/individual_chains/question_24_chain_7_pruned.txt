Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a mixture X that's equimolar and consists of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they produce a single hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, and it's a solvent widely used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, okay, let's start by figuring out what's going on here. The first part mentions that mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means the mixture has something that can reduce bromine, like unsaturated bondsâ€”probably alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine adds across double or triple bonds, causing the solution to decolorize.

So, mixture X must contain alkenes or alkynes. But wait, the problem says that when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. Since Pt is a catalyst, and heating is involved, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction? But wait, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning whatever Y has, it doesn't have double or triple bonds. So maybe X is a diene or something, and upon hydrogenation, it becomes a single compound.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each component is a di-substituted alkyne or something that would hydrogenate to a single product. Because when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is a single hydrocarbon. Wait, but the process says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. Oh, that's interesting. So both X and Y hydrogenate to Z. So Z must be something that both X and Y can hydrogenate to.

Wait, X is a mixture, so each component of X would hydrogenate to something. But since hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is a single product, that suggests that each component in X must hydrogenate to the same Z. But that can't be right because X is a mixture of two liquids. Alternatively, perhaps each component of X is a different alkene or alkyne that upon hydrogenation gives Z. So X has two different unsaturated compounds that, when hydrogenated, both become Z.

But wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated (the same conditions as the hydrogenation?), it forms Y. So the reaction with Pt and heat is perhaps a different reaction than hydrogenation. Because when they hydrogenate X and Y under more severe conditions, they get Z.

Wait, the initial treatment with Pt and heat is when X is converted to Y. That's a different process, perhaps a catalytic reaction, maybe an
