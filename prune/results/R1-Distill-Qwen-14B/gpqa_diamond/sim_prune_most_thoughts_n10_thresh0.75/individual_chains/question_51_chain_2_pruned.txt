Okay, so I've got this physics problem about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are all in terms of k, q, R, and d, so I should figure out the formula using these variables.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably affects how charges are distributed. Grounding means the sphere is connected to the earth, so any excess charge can flow in or out, keeping the sphere's potential at zero.

When you place a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will induce charges on its surface. But wait, the conductor is neutral to start with because it's grounded. Oh, no, actually, the conductor's initial charge depends on its connection. Since it's grounded, any induced charge would cause the conductor to have a charge that's opposite to the approaching charge, but the conductor's potential remains zero because it's grounded.

So the charge q induces a charge -q on the sphere. Wait, no. Wait, when you bring a charge near a conductor, the charges redistribute. If the sphere is conducting, the induced charge will be on the surface. But since it's grounded, any excess charge can leave. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. When I bring a charge q near it, the charge on the sphere will adjust such that the potential remains zero. But how?

Ah, here's a thing: the conducting sphere, when isolated, would have induced charges of -q on the side closer to the charge q, and +q on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, it can exchange charges with the earth. So, the sphere's net charge will adjust. Wait, but wait, the sphere's initial charge is zero because it's grounded, right?

Wait, no. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor, so when you place charge q near it, the charge on the sphere's surface would be such that the potential on the sphere is zero. Hmm, perhaps I should model this.

Alternatively, the sphere's induced charge is -q because of the charge q. But
