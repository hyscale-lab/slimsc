Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see. A chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we need to figure out which structure it is based on the spectral data provided. The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm.

First, let me look at the data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at 158 with 32%, so that's probably a fragment or maybe a doublet from some kind of isotope. But wait, if the molecular ion is 156, maybe the molecule has a molecular weight of 156. But let me check the options' molecular weights.

The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, so maybe an O-H stretch. Oh, but wait, if it's broad, it could be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Because in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader. But wait, carboxylic acids also have a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1. Oh yeah, the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That looks like a carbonyl group. So 1720 is a bit high; maybe it's an acid chloride or an ester? Alternatively, could it be a ketone? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid, which usually is around 1700 but can be higher depending on the structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm, a singlet, integrating to 1H. That's a pretty upfield shift for a proton. Wait, no, 11 is actually downfield, right? Like, very deshielded. So what gives a proton at 11 ppm? Probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are even broader, but in NMR, if it's a singlet, maybe it's not a broad peak. But wait, in the 1H NMR, the broad peak is in the IR, not the NMR. So maybe the 1
