Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. 

The question involves creating a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the GADD45G protein. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and noticed something's wrong.

The options are A through D, each suggesting a different issue. Let me break down what each option implies.

Option A: The sequence for the HA determinant has a missense mutation. So, did they get the HA sequence right? If there was a mutation, maybe the tag isn't present. But wait, the question says they introduced the HA sequence, but when they express, it's not working. But if the HA is messed up, would that prevent expression? Or maybe it's a problem with the tag, making purification difficult. Hmm, but the issue is overexpression, not just purification. Maybe a mutation in HA doesn't prevent the protein from being made.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean the mRNA has a stop codon somewhere in the sequence. Ribosomes read from the start codon until they hit a stop codon. So if the introduced sequence has a stop codon (like UAA, UAG, or UGA) early on, the protein would be truncated and maybe not functional. But looking at the given sequence, I'm trying to see if there's a stop codon.

Wait, let me think about the sequence. The sequence is the plus strand, which is the coding (non-template) strand. So when transcribed into mRNA, it would be complementary. Let me look for in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the first few codons are TAC ( Tyr ), followed by CCATACGATG... Wait, but wait, the sequence is written as the coding (sense) strand. So to find possible stop codons, maybe I should look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA. But the mRNA is the complementary of the template strand, which is the opposite of the plus strand.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The given sequence is the plus (coding) strand. So the mRNA is synthesized as a complementary strand to the template (minus) strand. So the mRNA sequence would be the same as the coding strand but with T replaced by U. So when looking for stop codons in the mRNA, I should look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding sequence (but using U instead of T). Hmm, but wait, the coding strand is the same as mRNA (except Tâ†’U). So in the plus strand, a TGA would be a TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the sequence. Let's see:

The sequence starts with ATG, which is start. Then TAC (Tyr), then CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking for TGA or TAG or TAA in the mRNA, which is the same as in the coding strand except Ts become Us. So in the coding strand, any TGA would become UGA in the mRNA, which is a stop. Let me scan the sequence for TGA.

Looking through the letters: 

... AGTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCA... Then later, ...CAGATGGGTGCCCAG... Hmm, I see TGA somewhere?

Wait, looking again. Let me scan the entire sequence. Let's make it easier by looking for 'TGA' in the coding strand.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for 'TGA' as a substring.

Breaking it down:

Start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Oh wait, here. So after some parts, the sequence is ...CAG ATT ACC GCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT G CTC ACT GCC GGC GT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TT C GTG TGC TGC GCT GCG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGCGAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA...

Wait, wait, in the middle, I see 'TGA' here: ...CTT C GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TT C GTG TGC TGC GCT GCG GTG AGG AGG AC GAG GGCGAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA...

So the part is TTA CGC TGA.

So the 'TGA' is at the end of this segment. So in the mRNA, this would be UGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct has a TGA (which becomes UGA in mRNA) in the middle. So the ribosome would terminate early, producing a truncated protein. That would prevent proper overexpression. So option B could be the issue.

But wait, the construct is the coding sequence for the GADD45G with the HA tag. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So if the mRNA has a stop codon early on, the protein would be too short. So why is the stop codon present? Did the researchers introduce an early stop? Maybe during cloning, there was an unwanted stop codon.

Another possibility: perhaps the HA tag insertion introduced a stop codon. The HA is added at the N-terminus, so perhaps in the construct, the HA's coding sequence is followed by the GADD45G. But if the HA's sequence introduced a stop codon, then the ribosome would stop there.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide derived from the influenza HA. Its sequence is usually added via inserting its cDNA into the construct. If the inserted HA sequence has a stop codon, then the mRNA would have that as the first stop. But in the given sequence, the HA is before the GADD45G.

Wait, but the start is ATG, which is the start codon. So after the start, the HA sequence is first, then the GADD45G. So if the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon, then the GADD45G wouldn
