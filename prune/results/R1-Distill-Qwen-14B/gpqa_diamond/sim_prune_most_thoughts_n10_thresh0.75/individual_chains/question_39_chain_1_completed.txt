Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, and we're told that when measuring the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So, we need to find 'a' such that the wave function is normalized, I think, because the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region should be 1.

Wait, right. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle isn't found outside that region, the wave function is zero elsewhere, so we only integrate between 1 and 3.

So the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but the normalization involves the absolute square, so the integral of ψ*(x)ψ(x) dx from 1 to 3 should be 1.

But looking at the expression, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function. Let me think about how to compute the absolute square.

The absolute square of ψ(x) is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So, [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ].

Multiplying these out, that's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 + i*(a/(sqrt(1+x)))*(-0.5i) + ... wait, no, maybe I should just use the formula (a - b i)(a + b i) = a^2 + b^2.

Because if you have a complex number (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B².

So in this case, A is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So the absolute square is [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + (0.5)^2 ].

Therefore, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function ψ(x) is said to be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization integral is ∫(from 1 to3) |ψ(x)|² dx =1.

So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{3} [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1.

Let me compute this integral step by step.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part:

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So the first part is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ].

Because when x=3, 1+x=4; when x=1, it's 2. So ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2= 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Wait, wait wait. Wait, 0.5 divided by ln(2) is 0.5 / 0.6931≈0.7213.

So a²≈0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That would be the closest.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistakes in the setup? Let me double-check.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute the absolute square, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25. That's correct.

So the integral is correct. So the calculation should be correct.

So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
