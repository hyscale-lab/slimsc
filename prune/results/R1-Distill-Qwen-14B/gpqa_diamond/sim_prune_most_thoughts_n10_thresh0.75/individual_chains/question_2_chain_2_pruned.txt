Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3 of this reaction sequence. Let me think through each step carefully.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Trans-cinnamaldehyde specifically has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents on either side are opposite each other. Its formula is C9H8O. So, 9 carbons in the benzene ring and the aldehyde group.

The first reaction is with methylmagnesium bromide. That's a Grignard reagent, right? Grignard reagents add to carbonyl groups. So, trans-cinnamaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is a carbonyl. The Grignard will add to the carbonyl carbon. 

When the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, the aldehyde (RCHO) becomes RCH(O-) after the attack. Then, when the work-up (like adding acid) happens, it protonates to form RCH2O-MgBr, but wait no, the actual product after work-up would be RCH2-OH? No, wait, no. Wait, the Grignard adds twice to ketones but only once to aldehydes. Wait, no, wait. Aldehydes are RCHO, and Grignard adds once to form RCH2O-MgBr, and then maybe after work-up, becomes RCH2OH? No, wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Grignard reagents react with aldehydes in a nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes have the structure RCHO. The Grignard (R'MgX) adds to the carbonyl carbon, the aldehyde becomes RCH(OR')O- which upon protonation gives RCH(OR')OH. Wait, but after work-up, the OR' becomes RCH2OH? Or is it RCH2OR'?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: when Grignard reagents react with aldehydes, the product is a secondary alcohol. Because the aldehyde (which is RCHO) reacts with R'MgX to form RCH(OH)R'. So, for example, formaldehyde (HCHO) would give RCH2OH when reacted with R'MgX, but for an aldehyde like propanal (CH3CH2CHO), the Grignard would add to the carbonyl, forming CH3CH2CH(O-)MgX, which upon protonation becomes CH3CH2CH(OH)R'. Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the number of carbons right here.

Wait, in trans-cinnamaldehyde, the aldehyde is at the end. So it's benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So structure is Ph-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO, right? Wait, no, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzene ring attached to a propenal group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2
