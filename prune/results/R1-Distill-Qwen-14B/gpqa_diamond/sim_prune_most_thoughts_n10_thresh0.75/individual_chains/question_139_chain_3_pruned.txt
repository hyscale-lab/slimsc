Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about determining the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Hmm, I remember that certain reactions can form ketones from other functional groups. Let me think about what's going on here.

The question states that compounds A and B are treated with NaNO2, HCl, and H2O to give diketones. The products are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. So I need to figure out what A and B are to produce these.

Wait, I think the reaction here involves the formation of a geminal diol from a ketone. Oh wait no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a diketone from a diol through some kind of oxidation. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, I remember that the treatment with HNO2 (nitrous acid) in acidic conditions (like HCl) can lead to diazotization, but that's more for aromatic amines, right? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when a ketone is treated with certain reagents, it can undergo a specific kind of reaction. But wait, perhaps it's about the formation of a diketone from a diol via oxidation. No, wait, oxidation of diols (like glycols) typically requires strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic conditions, which would break the diol into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh wait, I think this is the Stephen reduction? No, Stephen is for aldehydes to give alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the production of gem-dialkyl compounds.

Wait, another angle: I seem to recall that when a cyclic ketone is treated with a nitrous acid under certain conditions, it can form a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? No, I think that's a different reaction path.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Oh wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves the dehydration of a 1,2-diol (pinac
