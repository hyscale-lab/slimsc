Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, right? So first there's a reaction where butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B. So I need to figure out what reagents A and B are to make those reactions happen.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product? Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN... Oh wait, I remember that when ketones react with HCN, they undergo addition. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

In a typical scenario, a ketone like (CH3)2CO would react with HCN to form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But in the product here, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH2CH2)C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butane has four carbons. The nitrile is on C1, hydroxyl and methyl on C2. So structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH(CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Structure: (CH2CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but it's actually CH3CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count:

The product's formula: butanenitrile is four carbons with CN. So the product is (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN. Hmm, that's maybe 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is not a simple HCN addition. Maybe it's another kind of reaction, like a substitution. Wait, but NaCN is a good source of CN-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the starting material is (CH3)2CO. Let's write the product structure. It's CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the positions mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product in the question is butanenitrile. So maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple HCN addition.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction? No, NaCN is a nucleophile, but I don't think Grignard is involved here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. But butan-2-one is a ketone, which is not typically a good site for SN2 reactions. Unless it's a special case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is a hydrocyanation, but perhaps under specific conditions. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, the typical reaction is:

R2CO + HCN â†’ R2C(OH)CN

So
