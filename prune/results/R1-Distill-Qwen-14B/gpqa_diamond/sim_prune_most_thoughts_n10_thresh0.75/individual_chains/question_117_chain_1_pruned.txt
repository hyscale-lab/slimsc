Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about optical isomerism in different organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerismâ€”right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which usually happens because of chiral centers. So, I need to check each of the four compounds given and see if they can exhibit this.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism because the two benzene rings can be arranged in different ways around the central bond. Wait, but wait, biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can lead to E/Z isomerism or maybe even atropisomerism. But optical isomerism usually requires a chiral center or a molecule with a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize this structure. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the molecule would have two dimethyl ester groups attached to the 2 positions. The central bond is a single bond between the two benzene rings. Since the rings can rotate, but if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers. Wait, but biphenyls can have restricted rotation if the substituents are large enough, leading to atropisomers. The nitro groups are probably big, so maybe the molecule can't rotate freely. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. So this might have optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.** The structure is like CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as the ester of glycolic acid. The hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. Let's see: the structure would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait no, wait 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the second
