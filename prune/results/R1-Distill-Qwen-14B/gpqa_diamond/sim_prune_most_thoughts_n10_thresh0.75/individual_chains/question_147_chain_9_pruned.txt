Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two pairs of these A particles. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, which is the speed of light, so I guess I need to find something relativistic here.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, so it's moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light. That probably means we can use non-relativistic approximations for the calculations, like kinetic energy being much less than rest energy. Or maybe not? Because even if the antiproton is moving slowly, when it annihilates, the products could be moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, but the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, what's the mass of a proton? I think a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So the A particles are lighter than the proton.

Wait, no: m_A c² is 300 MeV, so the rest mass energy is 300 MeV. So each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c². So the proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So when they annihilate, they convert their rest mass into energy, which goes into the kinetic and rest mass of the products.

But wait, in the reaction, the number of particles is two A+ and two A-. So the total mass on the product side is 4 * 300 MeV/c² = 1200 MeV/c². The initial side is a proton and antiproton, each 938 MeV/c². So initial total rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV/c². So the initial rest mass is less than the product's rest mass? That can't be right because in reality, rest mass can't decrease in a reaction unless energy is provided. So wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, in reality, a proton and antiproton annihilating would produce energy, and particles would be created with that energy. But if
