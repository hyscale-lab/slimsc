Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars meet that criterion.

I remember that the detectability of a star depends on its brightness, which is related to its distance and intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude). The formula for calculating apparent magnitude might come into play here. Oh right, apparent magnitude (m) is how bright it appears from Earth, and that's calculated using the distance modulus.

The distance modulus formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, yeah. So for each star, I can calculate the apparent magnitude.

But wait, how does apparent magnitude relate to the signal-to-noise ratio? I think the S/N ratio for a star observed with a spectrograph depends on the number of photons detected. The brighter the star (lower apparent magnitude), the more photons we receive, leading to a higher S/N ratio.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT. I should check its characteristics. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed for very precise radial velocity measurements. But more importantly, I think it has a certain collecting area and efficiency.

Wait, the VLT telescope is 8 meters in diameter. The collecting area A is π*(D/2)^2. So D=8m, radius is 4m. A = π*(4)^2 = about 50 m². But wait, the VLT has four 8m telescopes, but in this case, ESPRESSO is coupled with one VLT telescope, so A is just the area of one 8m telescope.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe the key is the limiting magnitude for spectroscopy. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the photon flux. The S/N ratio depends on the number of photons. Let's think about the formula for S/N.

The S/N for a star can be approximated as S/N ≈ (N_photons)^(1/2), where N_photons is the number of photons collected during the exposure. To get S/N ≥ 10, we need N_photons ≥ 100.

The number of photons depends on the star's flux. The flux F (photons per second per area) is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), where m is the apparent magnitude. Wait, no, wait. The formula for flux in magnitudes is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F_0 is the reference flux (say, for a star of m=0). But perhaps it's easier to use the relation between magnitudes and photon counts.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the V band. The number of photons received from a star is
