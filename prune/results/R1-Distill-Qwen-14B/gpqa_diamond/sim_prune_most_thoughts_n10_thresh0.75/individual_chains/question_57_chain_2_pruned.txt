Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in such experiments, electrons are fired at a target, and we measure how they scatter. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

The problem gives me phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and we're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I guess we're considering up to l=4, since each δ corresponds to a different angular momentum quantum number l.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of these phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδₗ} sin(lθ) ) ), where δₗ are the phase shifts for each l. Oh wait, but wait, the imaginary part... right, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. So along the beam direction would be θ=0 degrees because that's where the incident beam is going.

So when θ=0, sin(lθ) becomes sin(0) for all l, which is zero. Wait, that can't be right because all terms would vanish. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh wait, maybe the formula is different when considering the full expression. Oh, right, I think the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) [e^{iδₗ} - 1] ) P_l(cosθ) )

Or wait, another version: f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδₗ} (sinθ)^l ) ), but wait no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion. For each partial wave l, the amplitude has a term involving e^{2iδₗ} - 1, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I should recall that each partial wave contributes a term like e^{2iδₗ} - 1, multiplied by (2l+1) and some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, the formula simplifies. Alternatively, perhaps the expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^{L} (2l +1) e^{2iδₗ} P_l(cosθ)

Where P_l are Legendre polynomials. Hmm, but wait, when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{2iδₗ} * 1.

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So that's Im[f(0)].

So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Given that, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}

Each δ_l is given, so for l=0 to 4, we have the phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, etc.

Wait, but wait, 90 degrees is π/2 radians, and so on. Let me convert each δ to radians or maybe work in degrees since all angles are given in degrees.

But in exponentials, the angle can be in radians. Hmm, but for the purpose of calculation, maybe I can compute the exponential in complex form.

Wait, the formula is e^{2i δ_l}.

So for each l, compute (2l+1) * e^{2i δ_l}, sum them, multiply by 1/(2ik), then take the imaginary part.

But what is k? Oh, k is the wave number, which is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Hmm, but the problem gives the incident electron energy as 50 MeV. So I'll need to compute k.

Wait, let me think. The energy E is given as 50 MeV, and the electrons are scattering from a nuclear target, so the target is a nucleus, perhaps a proton or something. Wait, but the problem statement says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So we proceed with the given data.

First, compute k. The formula for k is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, but E is the kinetic energy. So if the electron is non-relativistic, then E = (1/2) m v², but 50 MeV is a lot of energy for an electron. Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are important here.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic formula. Or perhaps it's using a different approach, like using the relation k = sqrt(2mE) assuming m is the electron mass. Let's proceed with the non-relativistic approximation.

But wait, another approach is to use the relation k = (E)/(ħ c), but I think that's for relativistic particles. Hmm, this might get a bit confusing. Let me think.

The general formula for the wave number in terms of energy is E = ħ² k²/(2m), for non-relativistic particles. So solving for k: k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But since E is given as 50 MeV, which is a huge amount of energy, perhaps we should use natural units or convert E into appropriate energy units compatible with ħ and mass.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use a specific expression to compute k. Let me think about the standard approach.

In electron scattering experiments, particularly in nuclear physics, the energy is often given in MeV, and the relevant constants are ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). So perhaps the calculation uses this.

Wait, but let's compute k.

E is 50 MeV. The rest mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than the rest energy, so the electron is ultra-relativistic.

In that case, the relativistic relation E = ħ c γ β, where γ is the Lorentz factor, and β is v/c.

But perhaps for the scattering problem, the wave number k is given by k = (E)/(ħ c) * something. Wait, another approach: the relation between the momentum p and the energy E for an electron is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But in ultra-relativistic cases, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c).

Then, k = p/ħ. So k = (E)/(c ħ) = E/(ħ c).

Given that, since ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm, so E
