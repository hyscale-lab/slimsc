Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Right, and each state is characterized by the values of S1, S2, S3.

Each spin has two possible states, so the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Let me think about the energy terms. Each term is the product of two spins, and each product can be +1 or -1.

Wait, the energy is -J times the sum of all three pairwise products. So each term in the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range between -3 and +3, since each product can be ±1. So the energy E will be -J multiplied by that sum, so E can range from -J*(3) to -J*(-3), which is -3J to +3J.

Wait, but each term in the sum is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the two spins are the same and -1 if different. So each term is ±1. So the sum could be 3 (all same), 1 (two same, one different), -1 (two different, one same), or -3 (all different).

Wait no, let me recheck. For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3:

If all spins are same, say all +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3.

If two are same and one different. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum=1-1-1= -1.

Wait, wait, no, 1 + (-1)
