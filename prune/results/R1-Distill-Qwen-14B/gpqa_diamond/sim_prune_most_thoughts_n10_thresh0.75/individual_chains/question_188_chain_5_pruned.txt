Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. I think in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is represented by a rhombohedron, which makes all the edges a, but the angles between them are equal.

The interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the formula from the Bragg's law context. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) * cos θ ), but wait, I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe I should recall the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, but that's for
