Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let me think.

Regularization in physics, especially in quantum field theory, is a method used to deal with divergences or infinities that appear in calculations. These infinities can cause problems, so regularization helps to make the calculations manageable by introducing a temporary 'cutoff' that can be removed later, a process known as renormalization.

Let me consider each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. Strings have a length scale, the string length, which is related to the Planck scale. Since strings have a size, maybe this helps in avoiding some of the infinities that point particles create. I think superstring theory is a candidate for a theory that doesn't require regularization because it's a theory of everything and perhaps it's finite. But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. But does that mean it doesn't have divergences? I think QCD still requires renormalization because even though it's asymptotically free, loop diagrams can still generate divergences. So regularization is needed here. So B likely requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has a Landau pole problem, meaning that at very high energies, the coupling constant becomes infinite. Also, calculations in QED, like electron self-energy, lead to divergences, which necessitate regularization and renormalization. So C does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so divergences due to things like point charges might not be a problem. But wait, in classical electromagnetism, you have things like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. So in that case, do you need regularization? Or is that a problem that arises in quantum theories because of the way we handle integrals?

Wait, in classical theories, you can have mathematical infinities, but since it's not a quantum theory, you don't regularize. Regularization is a
