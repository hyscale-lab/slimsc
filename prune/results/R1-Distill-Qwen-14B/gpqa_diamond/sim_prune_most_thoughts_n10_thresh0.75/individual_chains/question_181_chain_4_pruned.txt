Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to unpack it. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll think it through step by step.

Alright, the scenario says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? Because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light travels that in about 8 minutes. So if the pp-III process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the effects would just be reaching us now. Interesting.

The question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So the ratio is flux(Band1) / flux(Band2).

Wait, what do I know about the pp-III process? The proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, I think. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves higher energies and produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So, the pp-III process is responsible for producing neutrinos at higher energies. If it suddenly stops, that means those high-energy neutrinos won't be produced anymore. But the other reactions are still ongoing.

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the 400-800 keV range or so. Wait, maybe around 700-800 keV. Because the most prominent solar neutrinos come from the pp-III branch, known as the 7Be neutrinos, which have energies around 400-800 keV or so. So if pp-III stops, the production of these neutrinos would cease.

What about the other branches? The pp-I and pp-II are lower-energy processes. They contribute to lower-energy neutrinos. But wait, the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only pp-III is stopped. So all other neutrinos, like from the other branches, are still being produced.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in several steps of the proton-proton chain. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which produces low-energy neutrinos (~140 keV), and the dominant pp-I and pp-II branches.

The pp-I branch produces neutrinos via the 7Be decay, which gives neutrinos around 400-800 keV (I think the peak is around 500-600 keV, maybe up to 800). The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos as well, but perhaps at slightly higher energies than that? Or does the pp-III branch produce the highest?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the pp chain has a few steps. The initial steps involve three protons fusing into helium-2, which captures an electron to become helium-3. Then, the helium-3 can fuse in several ways.

The pp
