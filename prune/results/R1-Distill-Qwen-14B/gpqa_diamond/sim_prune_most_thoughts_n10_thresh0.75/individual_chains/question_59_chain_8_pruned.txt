Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the neutralization, and then calculate the pH based on that.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Volume of CH3COOH (acetic acid): 500 mL, concentration 0.1 M
- Volume of HCl: 400 mL, 0.2 M
- Volume of Ba(OH)2: 300 mL, 0.3 M

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base because the reaction between them depends on the mole ratio.

Wait, but wait—since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they'll react completely. And acetic acid is a weak acid; but since it's a solution, I'll need to consider if any of it is left after neutralization.

So let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate moles of HCl and Ba(OH)2.
2. Determine the neutralization reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2.
3. Subtract the moles to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.
4. Then, check the remaining H+ from any excess acid, including the acetic acid.
5. Finally, calculate the pH based on the excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh right, when you mix solutions, the total volume changes. So all volumes should be added together to find the final concentration.

Let me outline the steps clearly:

Step 1: Calculate moles for each substance.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)

- Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol
- Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol
- Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol

Wait, Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole H+.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, let's find out how much H+ and OH- we have.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the H
