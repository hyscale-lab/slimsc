Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different formulas, all with C11 or C12, O2, and varying H counts. 

First, I'll go through the given information. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹, and an ester oxygen usually has an absorption around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's parse them. Two are aromatic Hs. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would typically show certain splitting patterns. But in this case, the two signals could be due to different substitution patterns. Maybe para substitution? Or perhaps ortho or meta? Wait, two signals might mean that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons on either side would be equivalent, giving a singlet each? Or maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are not identical, causing different environments for the aromatic protons.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester or an alkene. The splitting is a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets implies coupling with two different sets of protons, each with 2 or 3 neighbors? Wait, actually, a quartet is when a proton is split into four peaks, which usually comes from coupling with three equivalent protons (n+1 rule, n=3). But a doublet of quartets would mean that the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, each giving a quartet. Or maybe it has two neighboring protons each with their own coupling, causing more splitting. I'm a bit confused about that part, but perhaps it's something like a trans ester group, like an ethyl group attached to the ester. 

The last two signals are for -CH3 groups. Since there's no -CH2 signals, that suggests that the molecule has two methyl groups, each possibly attached to an oxygen or as substituents on the aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like an aromatic ester. For example, imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester group and the other something else. But wait, the question says it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. Each substituent could be an ester or perhaps a methyl group attached via an ester. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is an ethyl or methyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for methyl groups. So perhaps there are two methyl groups in the structure. Maybe one is part of an ester (like an ethyl ester, which has a methyl group at the end) and another methyl group elsewhere. Or maybe both are part of the ester.

Alternatively, think about the ester functional group. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps one R is a methyl group (from the ester) and the other R is an aromatic ring substituent. But the aromatic substituents would be connected via the ester oxygen. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the aromatic ring are an ester group and another alkyl group.

Wait, let me think about the number of signals. The NMR shows six signals in total. Two aromatic, two vinyl, and two CH3. So that's 2 + 2 + 2 =6. But wait, the CH3 could be from the ester (like in an ethyl ester, which has a CH3CH2 group), but that would have a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. But in the data, there are no -CH2 signals. So that suggests that any CH2 groups are not present. Therefore, if the ester is an ethyl ester (like OCH2CH3), the CH2 would split into a triplet, but the NMR doesn't show any -CH2 signals. Hmm, that's a problem because an ethyl ester would have a CH2. So perhaps the ester is a methyl ester. Then, the ester would be OCH3, which is a singlet. But wait, the NMR has two CH3 signals. So if it's a methyl ester, that's one CH3. So where's the other one?

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent on the benzene is a methyl group. So the benzene has two substituents: one is a methyl ester (like O-CO-OCH3?), no, that's not right. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is an ester group where the R is a methyl group. For example, the structure is benzyl acetate or something similar. But let's think more carefully.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. The possible formulas are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2. So the difference is in the number of carbons and hydrogens. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation to see what each option implies.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N
