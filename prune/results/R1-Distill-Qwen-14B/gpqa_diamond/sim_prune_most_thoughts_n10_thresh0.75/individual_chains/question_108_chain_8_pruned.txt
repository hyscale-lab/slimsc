Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. 

Alright, the question says the magnetic field is along the Oz direction and has a small m (orbital magnetic quantum number). The field strength is B = 1 T. I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy term due to the magnetic interaction, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition is given to have a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether the paramagnetic term is much larger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

Wait, I remember that the energy levels in hydrogen are quantized, and transitions between these levels emit or absorb photons. The wavelength given is probably for a specific transition, like the Balmer series. Let me think, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which I think is the Balmer-alpha line, corresponding to a transition from n=4 to n=2. So that must be the ΔE we're talking about here.

Now, the paramagnetic term... I think that for an electron in a magnetic field, the magnetic energy is given by something like -μ·B. Oh wait, the magnetic dipole energy is -μ·B, right? And μ is the magnetic moment. So for an electron, μ is given by μ = -g_s * (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_s, but wait, no, the orbital contribution is different. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. The orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * L, but L is related to the quantum number l. The orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -l, -l+1, ..., l. So the energy due to the magnetic field would be H' = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, which is the z-axis, the dot product simplifies to H' = -μ_z * B.

So μ_z is (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, and since B is 1 T, the term becomes H' = - (eħ/(2m_e)) * m * B. So the magnitude would be proportional to m*B.

Now, what's the value of m here? The problem states that m is small. So m could be of order 1 because m can be 0, ±1, etc., depending on the orbital. But wait, maybe in hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be up to n-1, so for higher n, l could be larger. But the question says m is small, so it's probably a case where m is on the order of 1, maybe m=1 or 2 or something like that.

But wait, let me think about the actual values. The hydrogen atom's energy levels depend on n, but the paramagnetic term is a perturbation perhaps? Or is it part of the main energy term? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. 

Wait, no, this is probably a case where we're considering the Zeeman effect, where an external magnetic field splits the energy levels. The paramagnetic coupling term would be the Zeeman term. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is ΔE_magnetic = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. 

Wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So the magnetic energy term would be H' = μ_B * B * m. Since m is small, say m=1, then H' ≈ 1e-23 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 1e-23 J.

Now, the transition energy ΔE given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. Let's compute ΔE. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

Calculating E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m).

Let me compute that. 

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m → 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

So ΔE is approximately 4e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term H' is on the order of 1e-23 J (since m is small, say m=1). So comparing H' to ΔE: H' is 1e-23, ΔE is 4e-19. H' is much smaller than ΔE. So H' << ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, perhaps I'm confusing the energy terms here. Because in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are much larger than the Zeeman shifts. The ground state energy is about -13.6 eV. Let me check the value of ΔE here. 

Wait, the transition ΔE for λ=486 nm is probably between n=4 and n=2, which is in the Balmer series. Let me calculate the energy difference using the Rydberg formula. Ry
