Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainties in their energies are ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, then the lines would overlap and you can't distinguish them.

Wait, no. Maybe the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty of each state. So, for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So, to clearly resolve two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than either uncertainty, then you can tell them apart. So the condition is ΔE > max(ΔE1,
