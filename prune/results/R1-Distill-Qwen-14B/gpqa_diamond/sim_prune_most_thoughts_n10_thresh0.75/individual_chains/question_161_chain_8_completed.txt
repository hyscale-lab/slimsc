Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Let me try to think this through. Hmm, from what I remember, electron microscopes require a vacuum because the electron beam can't travel through gas molecules. But the question here is about the mean free path of the gas molecules when the electron beam is on.

So the setup: Mike created an ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles are still there. The mean free path is λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I recall is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter, and P is pressure.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, what happens? I think the electron beam has a high energy. Oh, right! High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or even eject electrons through processes like the Townsend discharge. So when the beam is on, it might cause the gas particles to lose electrons, becoming positive ions. Alternatively, maybe the gas molecules are being scattered by the electron beam more than before.

Wait, but the mean free path is determined by how often the gas molecules collide with each other, right? Or is it about collisions with other objects, like the walls or the sample? Oh right, in a vacuum, the mean free path is mainly about how the gas molecules collide with each other. So, in a perfect vacuum, they don't collide, but in reality, with some pressure, they do.

But when Mike turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed. So initially, he had λ1. But when the beam was on, it became λ2.

Wait, the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure. If the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases. But in this case, the pressure wasn't changing, because the pumps were already running and the sample compartment was under ultra-high vacuum. The temperature is the same as before, so what's different now?

Ah, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in the chamber somehow. Oh, I think when the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized. Once a molecule is ionized, it becomes charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly with the electric fields in the microscope, perhaps. Or maybe the ionized gas becomes more dense in certain regions because the charged particles are attracted to the beam or the sample.

Wait, but wait another angle. If the electrons from the beam interact with the gas, they might cause more collisions between the gas molecules. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe when the gas molecules are ionized, their mean free path changes because they can now interact with the walls or other charged particles more frequently.

Wait, but the mean free path is about the average distance between collisions. Collisions can be between gas molecules themselves (molecular collisions) or between gas molecules and other objects, like the vacuum chamber walls or the sample. In a high vacuum, the mean free path is large because the pressure is low—so the molecules don't collide with each other much, and maybe also don't collide with the walls because the chance is low.

But in the presence of an electron beam, perhaps the gas is more likely to be ionized. Let's think about the process. The electron beam has a high energy, so when it passes through the gas, it can knock electrons off the gas molecules, turning them into ions. These ions might then be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope or could stick to the sample or other parts.

Wait, but how does ionization affect the mean free path? If the gas is more ionized, then the mean free path could either increase or decrease. Hmm.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the presence of charged particles can lead to different types of interactions. For example, the ions may be more likely to stick to surfaces, which could reduce the effective number of gas molecules in the chamber. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to be attracted to the electron beam, which might cause them to be removed from the chamber through the beam's vicinity, effectively reducing their number in the sample area.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the free electrons are produced, which could lead to more electron-molecule interactions. But I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, but perhaps the main effect is that when the gas is ionized, the mean free path changes because the ionized particles have different collision properties. Or maybe the ionization doesn't directly affect the mean free path but affects the overall pressure.

Wait, but the question states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So if the temperature didn't change, and the pressure didn't change (since the pumps were already running), the mean free path should stay the same as λ1. But in the scenario, Mike found λ2 was different.

Hmm, but wait: perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure. How? Because when the beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which might lead to more frequent collisions in the gas. Or maybe the beam induces some sort of electric fields that cause the gas to behave differently.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but the mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. Wait, no, the mean free path is about the gas molecules moving and colliding with each other or the walls. The electron beam's presence affects the electrons, but perhaps the gas molecules are being more efficiently removed from the chamber when the beam is on.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be sputtered or pumped out. If that's the case, the effective pressure in the chamber decreases when the beam is on. Because as the electrons hit the gas, they ionize it, and then the ions could be repelled or attracted to the walls, leading to a decrease in the number of gas particles in the compartment.

Wait, but the initial pressure is already ultra-high vacuum, so the pumps are probably not the main factor anymore. So if the beam is removing more gas molecules, the pressure would drop, which would increase the mean free path. But the question states that the pressure was already below 1e-9 Torr before the beam was turned on. So maybe the beam isn't significantly changing the pressure, but it's changing the behavior of the gas.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas might become ionized, and these ions could be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. That would cause the ions to move towards the anode or cathode, effectively moving them towards the walls or the sample. This could cause the ions to leave the region where the electron beam is passing, but since the chamber is under vacuum, maybe this doesn't change the overall pressure much.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls, thereby changing the mean free path.

Wait, but mean free path is determined by the probability of a molecule colliding with another molecule or the wall. If the beam is causing the gas molecules to be more likely to hit the walls (because they're being pushed by electric fields towards the walls), then the mean free path would decrease. Because the molecules would be hitting the walls more often, so their average path length before a collision would be shorter.

Wait, let's think about the formula again. The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P) * (something). Wait, no, the formula for mean free path in a gas is λ = 1/(√2 * n * π * d^2), where n is the number density. Or another way, λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), since P = n k T. So n is proportional to P/(k T). So if pressure remains the same and temperature is same, n is same, so λ should be same. But the question says λ changed. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing a change in the effective number of collisions.

Wait another possibility: the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam pipe or the sample, but that's probably negligible compared to the overall volume. Alternatively, the beam could cause some gas molecules to be trapped or removed, effectively reducing their number, thus increasing λ.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it differently. The mean free path is determined by the density of gas molecules. If the electron beam somehow reduces the number of gas molecules in the chamber, the pressure would effectively decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. But in the scenario, the pressure was already measured as ultra-high vacuum before the beam was turned on. So the pressure shouldn't change much.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, and ionized gas molecules have different collision properties. But I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the ionized gas forms a plasma. In a plasma, the behavior of the gas changes because the ions and electrons interact with each other. In a plasma, the mean free path might be shorter because the charged particles are more likely to interact with each other, leading to more frequent collisions. So if the mean free path is λ1 when the gas is neutral, and λ2 when it's ionized and in a plasma, then λ2 could be less than λ1 because the ionized gas has more collisions.

But wait, wait—if the gas becomes ionized, the number of collisions between the ions and electrons could be higher, but does that affect the movement of the gas molecules (like the original neutral gas)? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ionization leads to more sticking to surfaces, thereby effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the chamber. But the question implies that the pressure didn't change because the temperature remained the same, so perhaps that's not the case.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas particles may be more likely to be scattered by the beam, but the mean free path is about their movement in the chamber. Wait, perhaps the beam isn't directly causing collisions but rather is causing the gas to move more, which could change the effective mean free path.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about what options are there. The question gives four options about the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So λ2 is larger, possibly much larger.

Option C: λ2 < λ1. So it's shorter.

Other options are B (same, which seems unlikely) and D (in between).

So why would λ2 be shorter than λ1?

If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to have shorter mean free paths. How could that happen?

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The presence of the electron beam could cause the molecules to collide more often. So why would that happen?

Ah! Maybe the electron beam imparts energy to the gas molecules, increasing their kinetic energy. If their temperature increases, the mean free path would increase because higher temperature implies higher speeds, leading to more frequent collisions, but wait, no, wait: higher temperature would actually cause higher velocities, but the mean free path formula depends on temperature. Let me check.

The mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). So if T increases, λ increases. But in the problem, the sample temperature remains the same. So that can't be the reason.

Wait, but the electron beam could cause the gas to heat up locally. If the gas temperature increases, that would cause the mean free path to increase. But the question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So maybe the gas is heated, but the sample is at the same temperature. So perhaps the overall gas temperature in the chamber goes up, which would increase λ. But that would make λ2 greater than λ1, which would be option A.

Alternatively, if the electron beam causes the gas to cool down, λ would decrease.

Wait, but in reality, high-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize and release energy, but I'm not certain whether that would heat the gas or not. Maybe if the gas is ionized, it could cause an increase in the kinetic energy of the ions, but this might not directly affect the neutral molecules.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam's presence leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. How? Because the beam could cause the molecules to move faster, but I thought that would increase λ, but the question says λ changes. So maybe the presence of the beam leads to more collisions, thus a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but if the beam is causing the gas to lose energy (cooling), then the gas molecules would move slower, which would increase the mean free path (since λ is inversely proportional to pressure, but pressure is same). Or, wait, no—slower-moving molecules would have longer mean free paths because they don't move as quickly to collide. Wait, no, mean free path is about how much they move before a collision. If they're moving slower, they take more time, but in a given space, the mean free path depends on the density.

Wait, perhaps the beam causes the gas to have a higher density in some regions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other because the beam's energy is causing them to move more, leading to more frequent collisions. Thus, the mean free path would decrease. That would mean λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. The mean free path is determined by the likelihood of a molecule colliding with another molecule. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is more ionized, and the ions are charged. Charged particles attract each other, so they might collide more often. So the number of collisions increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So that would point to option C, λ2 < λ1.

But wait, what if the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be accelerated, leading to a lower density in some regions? Or perhaps the ions are being drawn towards the walls, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the chamber. That would decrease the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. Then λ2 would be greater than λ1, which would be option A.

But wait, the question says the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So if the beam is causing the gas to be ionized, and the ions are moving towards the walls, that could reduce the number of ions in the chamber. But the pressure is a measure of the number of particles, so if the number of gas particles decreases, pressure decreases, so mean free path increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So that would be option A.

But I'm not sure. I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me try to think of it in terms of physics.

In a vacuum chamber with a high voltage electron beam, the presence of the beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized. The ionized gas can form a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be much shorter than in a neutral gas because the charged particles interact more strongly and can cause more frequent collisions. Because in a plasma, the Debye length is small, meaning the electric fields screen out quickly, but I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path of the original gas molecules.

Alternatively, when ionized, the gas becomes a conductor, and the electric fields from the electron beam can cause the ions to move, perhaps leading to more collisions. So the mean free path would decrease.

Wait, but in reality, when you have a plasma, the mean free path can be much shorter because electrons and ions move quickly and collide more often. So in that case, λ would decrease, leading to λ2 < λ1.

But wait, another thought. The mean free path is also influenced by the presence of charged particles which can stick to the walls or other surfaces. So if the gas molecules are ionized and then stick to the walls or the sample, the number of gas particles in the chamber decreases. If the number of gas particles decreases, the pressure effectively decreases, which would increase the mean free path. So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But the question says that the vacuum pumps were creating an ultra-high vacuum. When the electron beam is on, it's possible that additional pumping occurs because the ionized gas is being removed more effectively. For example, in some systems, the ionized gas can be drawn towards the walls or pumped out through the vacuum system. So the effective pressure would decrease, making λ longer.

So, in this scenario, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So that would be option A, since 1.22 times is a factor that might come into play with some effect.

Wait, but why 1.22 times? That number is approximately the square root of 2 divided by π, which is part of the mean free path formula. But perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, I'm not certain about the exact mechanism, but I'm starting to think that the presence of the electron beam may cause the gas to have a lower effective pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but in the problem, Mike accurately determined the mean free path based on the vacuum state. So perhaps the presence of the beam changes the effective pressure because some gas is being removed, perhaps through sputtering or other mechanisms, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path.

So, if the beam is removing gas molecules, the pressure would effectively decrease, which would cause the mean free path to increase. That would mean λ2 > λ1. So looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Hmm.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought that in a plasma, the mean free path might be shorter. But maybe that's in a different context.

Another angle: When the electron beam is on, it can cause the gas to be more ionized, which could cause the gas to stick to the walls more, effectively removing it from the chamber. This would lower the pressure, thus increasing the mean free path, so λ2 > λ1.

So, that would suggest that λ2 is greater than λ1, possibly much greater. So the answer would be option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. The mean free path is determined by how often the gas molecules collide. If the beam is causing the gas to be more efficiently removed, then the number of gas molecules decreases, so the collision frequency decreases, thus the mean free path increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C or A.

Wait, but which one? If Mike's initial determination was λ1 under the vacuum state, but when the beam is on, the gas is being removed, causing the mean free path to become longer than λ1. So λ2 would be greater than λ1, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: when the beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are more likely to be scattered by the beam's electrons, leading to more collisions. But the mean free path is about the gas molecules' movement, not their interaction with the electrons. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas molecules' mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, which would increase the mean free path. But if the sample temperature is the same, perhaps the gas's temperature is higher, which would increase λ.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to think of it in terms of the options.

If the mean free path is λ1 when the beam is off, and λ2 when the beam is on. If the beam's presence causes the gas to be more ionized and the ions are removed, the pressure effectively goes down, so λ2 increases. So option A.

Alternatively, if the beam causes more scattering, maybe the mean free path doesn't change, which would be option B, but that seems unlikely.

I think I'm leaning towards option C, λ2 < λ1. Because when the gas is ionized, the charged particles might have more frequent collisions, thus a shorter mean free path. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, leading to a lower number of particles in the chamber, but that would increase the mean free path.

Wait no, if the number of gas particles decreases, that would lead to a lower pressure. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure, so lower pressure would mean higher λ.

If the gas is ionized and some ions are removed from the chamber, then the pressure decreases. So the mean free path would increase, meaning λ2 > λ1. So option A.

But why would the mean free path change if the actual pressure doesn't change? Because the initial determination was based on the vacuum state. So perhaps the presence of the beam doesn't change the pressure, but the effective collisions change.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, which makes the gas more viscous. In a more viscous gas, the mean free path would be shorter because molecules collide more frequently. So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Hmm, this is really tricky. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and reasoning.

If the electron beam's presence leads to more frequent collisions (perhaps through ionization), then the mean free path would be shorter. So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the beam removes gas molecules, the mean free path would be longer, λ2 > λ1.

But how does the presence of the beam affect the number of gas molecules? The pumps are already creating ultra-high vacuum. So when the beam is on, perhaps some gas is being removed due to the beam's effects, leading to even lower pressure. So λ2 = λ1 * (P1 / P2), since P2 is lower, λ2 increases.

In that case, option A would be correct.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about what happens in a real electron microscope. The presence of the electron beam can cause gas to be ionized and pumped out, which is why some microscopes have special vacuum systems to handle this. So the pressure in the chamber effectively decreases when the beam is on because the gas is removed. So the mean free path would increase.

So, if the pressure is lower, λ increases. So λ2 = (P1 / P2) * λ1, and since P2 < P1, λ2 > λ1.

So the correct answer would be option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1.

Wait, but the question says Mike determined λ1 based on factors like pressure, volume, and temperature. When the beam is on, the temperature is the same, but perhaps the effective pressure is lower because the gas is being ionized and removed.

Thus, the mean free path would be longer, so λ2 is greater than λ1.

Therefore, the answer should be option A.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. Despite this, some gas particles remained, and Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state to be λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained constant.

The mean free path, λ, is inversely proportional to the pressure and depends on factors such as temperature, gas density, and molecular diameter. Initially, λ1 was determined under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the electron beam was turned on, it likely caused ionization of the gas molecules. Ionization can lead to several effects:

1. **Ionization and Gas Removal**: The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, turning them into charged particles (ions). These ions may be removed from the chamber due to interactions with electric fields or pumping mechanisms, effectively lowering the pressure in the chamber. A lower pressure increases the mean free path, leading to λ2 > λ1.

2. **Increased Collision Frequency**: Ionization could also increase the likelihood of collisions between charged particles, potentially shortening the mean free path. However, this effect is less likely to dominate compared to the removal of gas molecules.

Given that the sample compartment temperature remained constant, the primary factor influencing the change in mean free path is the removal of gas molecules due to ionization and interaction with the electron beam. This reduction in gas density effectively lowers the pressure, leading to an increase in the mean free path. Therefore, λ2 is greater than λ1.

Among the options provided, the most consistent conclusion is that λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1, as the presence of the electron beam significantly alters the effective pressure and gas behavior in the chamber.

Answer: A
