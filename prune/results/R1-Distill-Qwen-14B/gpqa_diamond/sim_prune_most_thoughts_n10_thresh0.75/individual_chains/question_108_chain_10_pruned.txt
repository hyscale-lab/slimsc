Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to their electrons' spins, right? But wait, the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so maybe it's about the orbital contribution rather than the spin?

Wait, the question says m is small. Oh, right, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. So if m is small, maybe the value is close to zero. But I'm not sure how that ties in yet.

The magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. So the field is applied along the z-direction. The problem is about comparing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field (the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment is given by μ = -gμ_B m * something, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh right, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ_orbital = (e/(2m)) * l, where l is the angular momentum. But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which is related to the z
