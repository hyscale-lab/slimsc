Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a given quantum state. Hmm, right. Uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩², I remember that from my notes. Oh wait, no, actually, the formula is ΔP = sqrt⟨P²⟩ - (⟨P⟩)^2. Yeah, that's right.

So the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I think this is a three-component vector, so it's in a three-dimensional space. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is the operator we're interested in.

Wait, P_z has a matrix form given. Let me look again. The matrix for P_z is diagonal: first row has (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ℏ). So the eigenvectors of P_z are the standard basis vectors, right? Because the matrix is diagonal already, each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate. So the eigenvalues are ℏ for the first basis vector, 0 for the second, and -ℏ for the third.

But the state given is in the eigenstate of P_x. Oh, so the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. So the state is a vector in that eigenstate. I need to find the uncertainty in P_z for this state.

So first, I should calculate the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, and the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Then use those to find the uncertainty.

Wait, the state is already a column vector. Let me write it as ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Because P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Let's compute it.

P_z is:
[ ℏ   0        0     ]
[ 0
