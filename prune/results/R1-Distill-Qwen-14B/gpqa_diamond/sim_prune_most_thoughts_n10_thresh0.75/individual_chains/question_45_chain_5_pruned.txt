Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. The options are A to D, each providing different triplets of energies.

Hmm, first things first. I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (nÂ²)E, where E is that given constant. But wait, since the particles are identical and spin-1/2, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So no two fermions can have the same quantum state. That probably affects how they fill up the energy levels.

Wait, but wait, in a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n. Each state is characterized by a specific n. And since the particles are fermions, each n can hold a certain number of particles, considering their spin.

Wait, spin-1/2 means each particle has two possible spin states, up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So each n can hold a maximum of two particles.

So with four particles, let's think about how they would fill the energy levels.

The ground state would be when the system has the lowest possible energy. So the particles will fill the lowest available n levels as much as possible.

Let me list the possible n levels and their capacities:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles
n=3: 2 particles
n=4: 2 particles
And so on.

We have four particles. So let's see:

n=1: 2 particles (fill both spin states)
n=2: 2 particles (fill both spin states)
That's four particles in total.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the energies would be E1 and E2. Each contributes their energy, but wait, each state is an individual particle. Wait no, the total energy is
