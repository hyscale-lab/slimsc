Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, what does that mean? Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. But I'm not sure if it's talking about their actual position in space being uniform or just their apparent distribution. I think in this context, it refers to the density in space being uniform, so the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere.

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). Right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, it's about the number density in terms of parallax. Let me denote N(> p) as the number of stars with parallax greater than p. Or maybe I should think in terms of differential number—like how many stars are there in a small range of parallax around p.

Wait, the number per unit range of plx. So like, if I have a thin shell in parallax space, how does the number of stars in that shell depend on p?

Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher parallax means closer stars. So, higher p means closer, lower p means farther away.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant. So, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is 4π r² n dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4πr² dr, and you multiply by the number density.

But parallax p is related to r. Since p (in arcseconds) is 1/r (r in parsecs). So r = 1/p. Let me write that down: r = 1/(p), so dr = -1/(p²) dp. Hmm, but when I change variables from r to p, I need to express the number in terms of p.

So the number of stars in a shell at radius r is 4π r² n dr. Let me plug in r = 1/p, so r² is 1/p². The dr is -1/p² dp, but since we're integrating over p, maybe I can ignore the sign for now as I'm considering a differential.

So substituting, the number becomes 4π (1/p²) n * ( -1/p² dp ). Wait, but that's negative because dr is negative when p increases. But I think since we're talking about the number of stars per unit p, maybe I should take the absolute value. So the number is 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The differential number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is dN = 4π n r² dr. But r = 1/p, so dr = -1/p² dp. So substituting r and dr:

dN = 4π n (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp = 4π n (-1/p^4) dp.

Since we can't have negative number of stars, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So dN = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. But that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the number of stars in a range of parallaxes between p and p+dp. Since p is inversely proportional to r, a small change in p corresponds to a change in r. So the number of stars in that shell is 4π r² n dr. But since dr = (dr/dp) dp, and r = 1/p, dr/dp = -1/p². So dr = -1/p² dp. So the expression becomes 4π (1/p²) n ( -1/p² dp ) = 4π n ( -1/p^4 ) dp. Again, absolute value gives 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, the question is about how the number per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, the number per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So as plx increases (closer stars), the number per unit plx increases as 1/p^4. But wait, higher p (more parallax) corresponds to closer stars. So if plx is higher, the number per unit plx is higher.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1/p^4, option D is 1/p^3, etc. So according to this, the answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try another approach.

The number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dθ dφ dr. So integrating over all angles, it's 4π r² dr. So for each shell of radius r and thickness dr, the number is 4π r² n dr.

But r = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, dr = -1/p² dp. So the number in that shell is 4π (1/p²) n ( -1/p² dp ), which is 4π n (-1/p^4) dp. Again, the absolute value would give 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is 4π n /p^4.

So the number density in terms of p is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but what if the question is asking for the cumulative number beyond a certain plx? Like, the number of stars with parallax greater than p. That is, N(p) = number of stars with parallax >= p. Then, since N(p) is the integral of dN from p to infinity, which would be integrating 4π n (1/p^4) dp from p to ∞. The integral of 1/p^4 is 1/(3 p^3), so N(p) ~ 1/(3 p^3). But the question is about number per unit plx, which is the differential, so it's the derivative of N(p) with respect to p, which is dN/dp ~ 1/p^4. So the initial conclusion holds.

Wait, but I think the question is phrased as "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So for each unit of parallax, how many stars do you have? So that's dN/dp, which is 1/p^4.

So the answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we consider the following:

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{r} \) (where \( r \) is in parsecs). Thus, \( r = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \).

2. **Number of Stars in a Spherical Shell**: For a spherical shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \), the number of stars is given by \( dN = 4\pi r^2 n \, dr \), where \( n \) is the uniform number density of stars.

3. **Substituting \( r \) and \( dr \)**: Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the expression for \( dN \), we get:
   \[
   dN = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) n \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi n \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
   \]
   Taking the absolute value (since the number of stars cannot be negative), the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:
   \[
   \frac{dN}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \), meaning it is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
