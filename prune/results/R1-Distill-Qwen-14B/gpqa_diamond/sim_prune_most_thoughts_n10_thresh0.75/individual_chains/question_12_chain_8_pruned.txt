Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for the purpose of this problem, the neutrino's rest mass can be considered negligible compared to the muon's. Or maybe it's just treated as massless? I'm not sure. I'll have to keep that in mind.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Pion (Pi+) is at rest, so its momentum p = 0.
- The decay products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).
- The rest mass of Pi+ is m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c².
- The rest mass of mu+ is m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².
- The neutrino's mass is approximately zero, so m_nu ≈ 0.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final. So 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu.

But wait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum times c. And the muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Alternatively, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), right?

Also, because momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta of mu and neutrino must be equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, p_nu = p_mu = p.

So E_nu = p c.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

So substituting E_mu and E_nu into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, let's see. Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

So subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Then square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6 - x)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So putting it all together:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Oh wait, the x² terms on both sides cancel out.

So, (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me
