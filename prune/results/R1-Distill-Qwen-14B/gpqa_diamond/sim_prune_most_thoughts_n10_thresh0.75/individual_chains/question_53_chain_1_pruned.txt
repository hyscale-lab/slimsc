Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key point. Esters typically have absorption around 1740-1760 cm⁻¹ in IR, which matches the given data.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals. Breaking them down: two for aromatic-H. So the substituents on the benzene ring are probably such that there are two different types of aromatic protons. Maybe para substitution or some kind of ortho that splits them into two groups.

Then there are two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. A vinyl group could be attached to the ring. Maybe it's part of a substituent like an ester group. Wait, ester groups have an O and a carbonyl, but the vinyl would be part of another substituent.

Also, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. And no signals for –CH2 groups. That means all the carbons in the molecule that are CH2 are either not present or perhaps part of a structure that doesn't split into distinct signals. Wait, but since it's an ester, maybe the substituent has a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Like an OCH3 group? But wait, esters are usually something like OCOOR, where R is an alkyl group. So maybe one of the substituents is an ester.

Let me think about possible structures. A di-substituted benzene with two ester groups? Or maybe one ester and another group that contributes to the NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps there's a vinyl group attached, like a substituent with an alkene. For example, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group.

But wait, let me think about the molecular formula options. The options are C11H
