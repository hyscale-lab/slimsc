Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun, especially in the core. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Wait, I should clarify what the pp-III branch is.

From what I recall, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium by fusing two protons, and then there are other branches. Oh right, the pp-II and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher energy particles, maybe more energetic neutrinos because of the higher energy states involved.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the surface. Oh right, because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light travels that distance in about 8 minutes. So if the pp-III stops 8.5 minutes ago, the effects would start to be observed here on Earth now because the neutrinos from the core would take that time to reach us. But wait, neutrinos are not affected by the same speed constraints as photons since they have such tiny mass. Well, actually, they do move at nearly the speed of light, so maybe the delay isn't so relevant for the neutrinos. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the timing here.

Wait, the question is about the flux reaching Earth now. If the pp-III branch stopped, how does that affect the neutrino flux we receive? But the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands: band1 is 700-800 keV and band2 is 800-900 keV.

I think the pp-III branch produces specific neutrino energies. For example, the main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are the electron neutrinos from the fusion processes. The pp-III branch might contribute to higher energy neutrinos. Let me think: the main neutrinos are from the pp-I branch, which produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus decays, right? Or wait, the pp chain produces deuterium, and then fusions continue. The pp-III branch might involve reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos, like maybe the ones in the higher energy bands.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of higher neutrino energies would stop. Let's think about the energy distribution. If pp-III is responsible for producing neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band2 (800-900) more than in band1 (700-800).

Wait, or maybe pp-III produces a significant portion of the neutrinos in higher energy bands. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop more than in band1. So the flux ratio (band1 / band2) would increase. Because band2's flux is partly due to pp-III, which has stopped, so the flux in band2 would decrease more than band1.

Wait, but what's the usual contribution of
