Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They’re studied using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between them. Specifically, Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3, right? That means I can write T1 as 1.4*T2, and T2 is 2.3*T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3 = 3.22 * T3. Not sure if I'll need that though.

Next, the mass ratios. Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15, so M1/M2 is 1.15, meaning M1 is 15% more massive than M2. Similarly, M2/M3 is 1.35, so M2 is 35% more massive than M3, which makes M3 = M2 / 1.35.

The question is about the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. So I need to find P3 / P1, and they're asking by what factor P3 is larger than P1.

All three have the same albedo, 0.3, same as Earth. So albedo doesn’t come into play in the calculations, I think. Wait, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and albedo. The formula I remember is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4). Since albedo a is same for all, and assuming they orbit the same star, which I think we can assume here because it's a system of three exoplanets, same star. So L and a are same, so T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). Because T is proportional to sqrt(L/(d^2)), so d is the distance from the star.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is T = [ (L*(1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ) ]^(1/4 ). So if a is same, then T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), because L and σ are constants for the star. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).

So, if T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, and T2 of Planet2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1), because d1 is the distance of Planet1, and d2 of Planet2. Because sqrt(d1/d2) is the inverse of T1/T2. Wait, wait. Let's see. Let me write it as T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So T1 = k / sqrt(d1), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So yes, T_ratio = sqrt(d2 / d1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4, so d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, T2/T3 = sqrt(d3/d2), so sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3 → d3/d2 = 5.29 → d3 = 5.29 * d2.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because when the temperature is lower, the planet is farther away. So if T2 is less than T3? No, wait. Wait, T2 is the temperature of Planet2, and T2/T3 is given as 2.3. So T2 is bigger than T3. So Planet2 is closer than Planet3, because higher temperature. So using the same formula: T2 / T3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 ). So if T2 > T3, then d3 > d2. So the distance of Planet3 is larger than Planet2.

So, for T2 / T3 = 2.3, sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3 → d3 = (2.3)^2 * d2 = 5.29 * d2.

So now, let's express all distances in terms of d1.

We have d2 = 1.96 * d1.

d3 = 5.29 * d2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1.

Compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me calculate that. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96 is approximately 0.5684. So total is about 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.3684 * d1.

So the distance ratio d3/d1 is approximately 10.3684. So d3 is about ~10.37 times d1.

Now, the orbital period is given by Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M)) ) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star), M is the mass of the star. For a planet orbiting a star, the period squared is proportional to a cubed over the sum of the planet and star masses. But in most cases, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

But in this problem, the planets are orbiting the same star, so M_star is the same for all. So P² ∝ a³ → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So, the ratio of periods P3/P1 is (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. d is the distance, so a is the same as d in this context because the orbits are circular. So yes, a = d. So yes, P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Wait, no. Wait, the Kepler's law is in terms of the semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is the radius. So yes, a = d.

So, let me compute 10.3684^(3/2). Let me think about how to compute that.

10.3684 is approximately 10.37. Let's compute sqrt(10.37) first, which is about 3.22 because 3.22^2 is about 10.3684. Oh, wait! Wait a second. Because 3.22 squared is 10.3684, which is our d3/d1 ratio. So sqrt(d3/d1) is 3.22. Hmm, so sqrt(10.37) is 3.22.

Wait, but we need (d3/d1)^(3/2) = [sqrt(d3/d1)]^3 = (3.22)^3. So 3.22 cubed.

Calculating 3.22^3: 3.22 * 3.22 = approximately
