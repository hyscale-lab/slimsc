Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's, and also emit two E particles and two V particles. Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V's, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The question is about how the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles changes in this variant compared to the original decay.

Hmm, I remember that when particles are emitted in a decay, their energy distribution can affect the spectrum. For example, in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the Q value is shared among the electron and the antineutrino, and their energies vary.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. If those V particles are, say, like electrons or neutrinos, their emission would carry away energy. Now, in the original scenario, the E particles have a continuous spectrum because their total energy is shared with the V particles. The maximum energy endpoint Q would be determined by the total available energy, maybe the mass difference between A and B.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M particle. And M is massless. So M is like a photon or a neutrino, I guess, because it's massless. So the products are 2E and M.

Wait, but how does the number of particles emitted affect the spectrum? In the original case, there are two V's. Let's think about energy sharing. If the E particles are emitted along with V's, each E can have a certain energy depending on how the energy is split between E and V.

In the original setup, since there are two V's, each E and each V can take some energy. So the E particles' maximum energy would be when the V's take the least possible energy. But since V's are perhaps lighter or massless, the E's can go up to the maximum Q.

In the variant, instead of two V's, there's only one M. Since M is massless, it's like another particle that takes energy. But wait, the original decay had two E's and two V's, making four particles in total. Now, the variant has two E's and one M — three particles.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about energy and momentum conservation. When multiple particles are emitted, the energy can be shared in various ways. If the number of particles changes, the energy spectrum might change.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are produced. If E and V are charged particles that can be detected, their energies are measured. The E particles can have a range of energies because the energy is shared among them and the V's. The total energy released (Q value) is fixed, so the E particles can't have more than Q each, but they can vary.

But in the variant, the two E's and one M are emitted. Since M is massless, it's like having an additional energy carrier. How does this affect the E's spectrum?

Wait, maybe it's about whether the E's are the only charged particles and how their energy is determined. If in the original case, E and V are both charged, then the E's can't take all the energy because V's also carry energy. But in the variant, if M is massless and neutral, perhaps it takes away energy without being detected, changing the maximum energy available for the E's.

Wait, in the original decay, with more particles, the E's might have their maximum energy lower because more particles are sharing the energy. Alternatively, in the variant, with one fewer particle, perhaps the E's can have higher maximum energy.

Wait, but the question says the original E particles have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. In the variant, how does that change?

Let me think about another example. Like in beta decay: when a nucleus emits a beta
