Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I should probably write that down. So the state vector is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? Because probabilities have to add up to 1. Hmm, let me check the length of this vector.

The length would be the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. So that's 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but when you calculate probabilities, you might need to normalize it because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the components. So maybe I should normalize it first.

Wait, but the observable is given by matrix P. Let me look at the matrix P again. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. I think P is the matrix representation of the observable. In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I guess the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is an eigenvalue. Because if it is, then the probability would be the squared amplitude of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenvector's direction.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's try to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should model this properly. So P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(
