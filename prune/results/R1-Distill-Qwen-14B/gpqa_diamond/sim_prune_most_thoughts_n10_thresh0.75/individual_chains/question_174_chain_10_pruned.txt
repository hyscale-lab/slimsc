Okay, so I've got this physics problem about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' rest-masses sum up to 99% of M. Oh wait, so M_initial is 300 GeV, but the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99*M. Since M_initial is the rest mass, which includes the rest mass of the products, right?

Wait, but wait. The rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So that's 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial rest mass was 300, the sum is 297. So the mass difference is 3 GeV. Hmm, but that's the mass converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy or radiation.

Wait, but the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So each fragment has rest mass. The more massive one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the two masses as m1 and m2. Given m1 = 2 * m2. And m1
