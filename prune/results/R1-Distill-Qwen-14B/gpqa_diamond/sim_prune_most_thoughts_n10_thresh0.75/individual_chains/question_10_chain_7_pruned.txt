Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options a to d.

Hmm, wait, wait. The options are labeled a to d, but the choices are A to D. I have to be careful not to mix them up. Let me read the question again.

The question lists four options, each describing a planet with different mass and radius or density. I need to find out which one has the highest density.

Density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, volume depends on radius. The formula for density is density = mass / volume. And the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So for planets, if we know their mass and radius, we can calculate density.

Alternatively, maybe some options give the density directly. Let me look at each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg, and radius around 6.37e6 meters. Earth's density is roughly 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. No, no. Wait, the option says the planet has a density of 5.5, so that's the value. So this one is already given as 5.5 g/cm³.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, if the composition is the same as Earth, then the density should be the same, right? Because density is mass per unit volume, and if the composition is same, the material is same, so density same. But wait, if the mass increases by a factor, but the radius doesn't scale in a certain way, then the density could change. Wait, no. Same composition implies same density. Because density is intrinsic property. So if a planet has same composition as Earth, whether it's bigger or smaller, its density is same as Earth. So option c's density is same as Earth, 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose Earth's density is 5.5. If a planet is made of same materials but 5 times the mass, how does the radius change? Well, for Earth-like planets, mass scales with radius
