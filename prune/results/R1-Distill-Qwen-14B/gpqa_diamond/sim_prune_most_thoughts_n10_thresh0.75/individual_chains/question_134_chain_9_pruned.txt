Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The problem says that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when they're mixed.

Wait, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases.

But wait, here we have more than one acid and a base. So I need to figure out which ones are reacting. Oh right, the acids (HCl and H2SO4) will react with the base (Ba(OH)2).

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because moles will determine the amount of reaction possible.

HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Let me write the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O
Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has two OH groups. So each Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+ ions. So for HCl, which is H+ and Cl-, each mole gives one H+.

Similarly, H2SO4 is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-. So each mole gives two OH- ions, which can neutralize two H+ ions.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. So the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base will determine whether there's excess or not.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Equivalents are moles multiplied by the number of H+ or OH- per molecule
