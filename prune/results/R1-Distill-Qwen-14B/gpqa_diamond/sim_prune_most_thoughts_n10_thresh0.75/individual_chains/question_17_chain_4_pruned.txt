Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds to metal ions like calcium. So the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) represents the equilibrium between the metal (M), the ligand (L), and the complex (ML). The formula is Kf = [ML]/([M][L]). So when you have a complex, the concentration of the complex is related to the concentrations of the individual ions.

In this case, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I can assume that all the Ca²+ is bound by EDTA, but some might dissociate. But wait, the EDTA is in excess, right? Because usually, when you form a complex, you have more ligand than metal ions. But in stoichiometric conditions, the concentrations are just right, meaning the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex without excess. Wait, the question says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", so I think that means [Ca²+] is equal to [EDTA^4-], but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Stochiometric would mean that the moles are in the correct ratio. So for Ca-EDTA, which is a 1:1 complex, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So originally, without any dissociation, the concentration of Ca²+ would be 0.02 M, and EDTA would also be 0.02 M. But because the formation constant is so large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

So the setup is that the complex dissociates a little bit:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But since the initial concentrations are 0.02 M for the complex, and assuming that some x amount dissociates, then:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small due to the large Kf).

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So plug into Kf:

(0.02)/(x * x) = 5e10

So 0.02/(x²) =5e10 -> x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 /5e10 ? Wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.02 divided by (5e10) is 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e1
