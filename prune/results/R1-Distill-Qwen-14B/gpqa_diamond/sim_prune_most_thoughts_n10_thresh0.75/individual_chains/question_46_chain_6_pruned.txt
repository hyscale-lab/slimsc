Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, what's the question again? Oh right, how many possible products are there, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing metathesis and cross metathesis. So in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure to visualize better.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, that's six carbons. Oh wait, wait: pent-1-ene is five carbons with the double bond between 1 and 2. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, that's five carbons. So yes, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the formula is C5H10, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond at 1 and 2, and a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps I should just write the structure. So:

1    2    3    4    5
CH2-CH2-CH-CH2-CH3? No, no, the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait,
