Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions using mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. The products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions, especially for epoxidizing alkenes. So, the first step in each reaction is epoxidation. Then, after aqueous acid, something else happens.

Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The mechanism typically involves the protonation of the oxygen, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then water (or another nucleophile) attacks the less substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic. Wait, but in some cases, like symmetrical epoxides, maybe both carbons are equally substituted, so the ring opening could form a single product.

So let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait no, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So for (E) isomer, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, wait, let's get the structure right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, no. Let's correct that. Octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, structure would be:

The double bond is between C4 and C5.

So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps better to write as:

Carbon chain: 1 to 8.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps more accurately, (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right because the double bond would be between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So each side of the double bond is CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH2CH2CH3? Actually, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For mCPBA, which is a peracid, the epoxidation occurs with an electrophilic addition. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxides will have different stereochemistry.

Wait, I think that mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face, leading to an epoxide with a specific configuration. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, adding mCPBA would form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces? Or same faces? Wait, no, the addition is concerted, so the peracid attacks the double bond, leading to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, but mCPBA addition is stereospecific. So if the starting alkene is trans (E), then the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms across from each other. Similarly, for a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same side.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans-epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening.

In acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon is more stabilized when it bears the positive charge. Wait, but in oct-4-ene, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two CH2 groups. So in the epoxide, each carbon is connected to two CH2 groups. So when the ring opens, which carbon is more substituted? Let me think.

Wait, the epoxide structure from (E)-oct-4-ene: the two CH2 groups on each end. When epoxidized, each of the two carbons in the epoxide would have two CH2 groups attached. So when the ring opens, which position will have the nucleophilic attack?

Wait, in epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because the more substituted position is more stabilized when protonated. Wait, no — the nucleophile attacks the carbon that is more electrophilic. The more substituted carbon is more stabilized (less electrophilic?), so the attack is more likely on the less substituted. Or wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like the one formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, the ring-opening would result in a single product. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack on either side would give the same product.

Wait, no, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is not symmetric. Wait, let me think again. The starting alkene is (E), which is trans. So when mCPBA adds to it, the oxygen atoms will be on opposite sides, leading to a cis epoxide? Wait no, maybe it's opposite.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the stereochemistry here. Let me clarify.

The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene forms an epoxide. The peracid adds to the same face of the double bond, leading to a trans epoxide when the starting alkene is trans.

Wait, no. The addition of mCPBA is a syn addition because the peracid approaches the same face of the double bond. So for a trans (E) alkene, the oxygen atoms will be on opposite faces of the resulting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents (CH2CH2 on each end) are on opposite sides of the double bond. When mCPBA adds to the same face (syn addition), the oxygen atoms will end up on the same face? Or opposite?

Wait, no. Let me think of the double bond as being between C4 and C5. For (E), the groups on C4 and C5 are opposite. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, the two oxygen atoms come from the same face. So in (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each side are opposite, so the addition of mCPBA's oxygen would result in the epoxide oxygen atoms being on the same side?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the geometry. The starting alkene is E, so the two substituents on each carbon (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds from the same face, the oxygen atoms would be on the same face as each other, but their positions relative to the substituents would depend on the starting geometry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up how mCPBA affects E and Z alkenes. Or perhaps think about the outcome: for (E) and (Z) alkenes, mCPBA will form different epoxides.

Wait, another approach: the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene would produce a trans epoxide because the starting double bond is trans. Because the addition is syn, the two oxygen atoms end up on the same face, leading to a trans configuration. Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the peracid adds to the same face. So when the starting alkene is trans (E), the substituents on each end are opposite. So adding mCPBA's oxygen on the same face would make the two oxygen atoms on the same face, but on opposite sides of the ring. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of the resulting epoxide as a trans epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E) and (Z) alkenes would produce different epoxide structures. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be trans, and for (Z), it would be cis.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ring-opening next.

After epoxidation, each Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 (with E and Z alkenes) produces an epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a diol. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's structure.

In aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens with nucleophilic attack by water. The mechanism is that the epoxide oxygen is protonated, which makes it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbons become positively polarized, and the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when the positive charge is on a more substituted carbon.

Wait, no, I think the more substituted carbon is more stabilized, so when the epoxide oxygen is protonated, the adjacent carbons have partial positive charges. The more substituted (more stable) carbocation is formed when the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon, because that leaves the more substituted carbon to bear the positive charge, which is more stable.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. When the epoxide is protonated, the ring breaks, and a transition state forms where each oxygen is attached to a CH2 group. The nucleophile (water) attacks the carbon that is more electrophilic, which is the less substituted one because the more substituted one would have better carbocation stabilization if it were to form.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon would lead to a more stable carbocation, so it's less likely to form (since the transition state would have partial charges). Alternatively, perhaps the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic, even if it's less stable.

Hmm, maybe I should look up the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh wait, in the acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon. Because when the epoxide is protonated, the adjacent carbons become more electrophilic. The more substituted carbon is more stabilized when it bears the positive charge, so it's more likely to be attacked.

Wait, no. Let me think of a specific example. Take ethylene oxide. When it's treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon because, in ethylene oxide, both carbons are equally substituted. So, the attack can happen on either, leading to a racemic mixture if the epoxide was chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs at the less hindered position. For symmetric epoxides, it's the same, but for asymmetric ones, it's the more substituted carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct rule is that the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic due to adjacent substituents providing better stabilization.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs on the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon is less electrophilic. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the transition state.

In the ring-opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, leading to partial positive charges on the adjacent carbons. The attack happens at the more substituted carbon because the adjacent substituents can stabilize the transition state better. So the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but in our case, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene may have different structures, leading to different diols upon ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol.

Each reaction produces a diol, and when combined, these diols are analyzed by HPLC.

So, let's think about each diol.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, which adds across the double bond in a syn addition, leading to an epoxide. The starting alkene is E, so the substituents are opposite. So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a trans configuration. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is trans if the starting alkene is E.

Wait, perhaps the (E) configuration leads to a trans epoxide. Let me think: if the double bond is E (trans), then the substituents on each end are opposite. When mCPBA adds across, adding oxygen on the same face, the substituents on the epoxide would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide.

Wait, no. Because mCPBA adds from the same face. So for an E double bond, which has substituents opposite, adding the oxygen from the same face would make the epoxide's substituents on the same face? Or opposite?

Wait, perhaps I should visualize it. Imagine the double bond as CH2-CH2, with substituents on each CH2 being opposite for E. So when mCPBA adds to the same face, the oxygen atoms would end up on the same face of the resulting epoxide. But wait, the original substituents were opposite, so the epoxide's substituents would be on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis configuration in the epoxide. Wait, but that would make the epoxide cis, which would be different from the starting E geometry.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of an example: consider cyclohexene. If it's trans (E), when mCPBA adds, the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide. For (E) alkenes, the epoxide is trans, and for (Z), it's cis. So when mCPBA adds to an E-alkene, it forms a trans epoxide, and to a Z-alkene, a cis epoxide.

Assuming that, let's proceed.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid to form diols.

Now, what happens when each of these epoxides is opened in acid?

For a trans epoxide, the ring-opening would produce a specific diol. Similarly for a cis epoxide.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide structure is important. Let's think about the structure of the epoxide.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans configuration). So when it's opened in acid, the attack will happen on each carbon, leading to a diol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but would the diol from a trans epoxide be a single stereoisomer or a mixture?

Wait, when a trans epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens with nucleophilic attack on the more substituted carbon. Wait, but in this case, the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps? No, oct-4-ene is symmetric in terms of substituents on each end, so the epoxide would be symmetric.

Wait, no, because for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3, but perhaps in this case, each end is actually the same. Because oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule—each end of the double bond is CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric around the double bond. Because the substituents on each end are CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Oh, wait, that's not symmetric because the substituents are different on each end. So the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would not be symmetric.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule because the substituents on each end are the same. Because oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, maybe. Let me count the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: CH2
Double bond between C4 and C5.
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH2
Carbon 7: CH2
Carbon 8: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps another way: CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 is a 8-carbon chain with the double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond is CH2CH2CH2- and CH2CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps each end is CH2CH2CH2 and CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, because the double bond is between C4 and C5, so the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: CH2-
Double bond between C4 and C5: so C5 is CH2-
Carbon 6: CH2
Carbon 7: CH2
Carbon 8: CH3.

Wait, no, because that would make it 8 carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, the double bond is between C4 and C5, so:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's 8 carbons. So each end of the double bond is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- and CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents on each end are different. So the epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene would have different groups on each end.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would have substituents on the same side.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let's proceed to the diol formation.

When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the attack direction.

Assuming that the epoxide is trans (from E-alkene), when it opens, the attack occurs on each carbon. Because the nucleophile (water) attacks each carbon, leading to a diol with two new stereocenters.

Wait, but wait, the epoxide is not symmetric, so each attack could lead to different products. Alternatively, perhaps the attack leads to a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but if the epoxide is trans, then the attack on each carbon could lead to either retention or inversion of configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs from the opposite side, leading to trans stereochemistry in the diol.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that in the epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite face, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, no, perhaps the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's structure. For a trans epoxide, the diol would be cis, and for a cis epoxide, the diol would be trans? Or the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol would retain the stereochemistry of the epoxide. Or maybe it's the opposite.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about specific examples. For example, when trans-2,3-dimethyloxirane (epoxide) is treated with acid, the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides.

Wait, in the ring-opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite face. So if the epoxide is trans, the attack would lead to the diol having the OH groups on the same face?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol's configuration is anti to the epoxide's.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think that the diol formed from a trans epoxide would be a trans-diol, and from a cis epoxide, a cis-diol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol's stereochemistry is determined by the ring-opening mechanism.

Wait, another approach: during acid-catalyzed ring opening, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, leading to a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon from the opposite side due to the Bredt's rule or similar. Wait, no, perhaps it's the more substituted carbon that's attacked.

Wait, perhaps the attack is on the more substituted carbon, and the nucleophile comes from the opposite side, leading to trans stereochemistry in the diol.

Wait, but in our case, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and when it opens, the diol would have the two OH groups on opposite sides, making it a trans-diol.

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis, so the diol would have the OH groups on the same side, making it a cis-diol.

Wait, but let me think about the specifics. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans. So when ring-opening occurs, each OH group is added to the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or opposite faces?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol will have both OH groups on the same face if the epoxide was cis, and opposite faces if the epoxide was trans.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ring-opening mechanism. The epoxide is planar, and the proton is added to the oxygen. Then, the adjacent carbons become positively charged. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite face because the epoxide is a three-membered ring, which is strained, leading to attack from the opposite side.

So, in a trans epoxide, the attack on each carbon would be from the opposite face, leading to the diol having both OH groups on the same face, making it a cis diol. Or wait, that would lead to a trans diol.

Wait, perhaps an example would help. Consider trans-2,3-dimethyloxirane. When it opens, the attack on each carbon would be from the opposite face, leading to the diol having the OH groups on the same face. So the diol would be cis.

Similarly, for cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane, the attack would be on each carbon from the same face, leading to the diol being trans.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that reversed. Let me think again. In a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. When the epoxide is opened, the nucleophile attacks each carbon from the opposite side, leading to the diol's OH groups being on the same face—so a cis diol.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in a trans epoxide, the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. So when each OH attacks from the opposite face (due to the ring strain and the transition state), the diol would have both OHs on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Similarly, a cis epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same face. When each OH attacks from the opposite face, the diol would have the OHs on opposite faces, making a trans diol.

Wait, so the epoxide's configuration determines the diol's configuration.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → cis diol.

For Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → trans diol.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the epoxide is trans, the diol would be cis.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, let's think of it this way: the trans epoxide (from E-alkene) would form a diol where the two OH groups are on the same face (cis), and the cis epoxide (from Z-alkene) would form a diol where the OHs are on opposite faces (trans).

So Reaction 1 gives cis-diol, Reaction 2 gives trans-diol.

Wait, but then when both diols are combined, how many products do we have?

Wait, but wait, each diol is a single product. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction goes to 100% completion.

Wait, but the diols may have stereoisomers. Let's think: the diol from Reaction 1 (cis) would have two stereocenters. Are they the same or different?

Wait, the diol from Reaction 1 is a cis-diol, which would have two stereocenters. Let's say the diol has OH groups on the same face, so the two stereocenters are either both R and S or both S and R, or perhaps each has the same configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible stereoisomers.

For a 1,2-diol (from oct-4-ene), the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. So, each OH can be on either the same face (cis) or opposite (trans).

Wait, but the diol from Reaction 1 is cis, so the two OHs are on the same face. That would lead to two enantiomers—each with opposite configurations.

Wait, but in reality, when a diol is formed from a symmetrical epoxide, it would form a single diastereomer. Wait, but our epoxide is not symmetrical.

Wait, in Reaction 1, the epoxide is from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric molecule. So the epoxide would be symmetric, leading to a diol that is also symmetric.

Wait, wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So when mCPBA adds, the epoxide would also be symmetric. Thus, the diol formed would be a single product, not a mixture.

So, in Reaction 1, the product is a single stereoisomer—perhaps a meso compound.

Similarly, Reaction 2's epoxide is from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Since the starting material is symmetric, the epoxide would be symmetric, leading to a diol that is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but wait: (Z)-oct-4-ene is also symmetric. Because the substituents on each end are the same. So the epoxide would be symmetric, leading to a diol that is a single product.

Wait, but in the case of the (Z) epoxide, the diol would have the OHs on opposite faces, making it a trans-diol, but since the molecule is symmetric, it would be a single product.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → symmetric trans epoxide → diol is a meso compound (cis diol, but symmetric, so no net chirality).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → symmetric cis epoxide → diol is a meso compound (trans diol, but symmetric).

Wait, but wait, in Reaction 1, the diol would have two OH groups on the same face, but due to symmetry, the molecule would be meso, not chiral. Similarly, Reaction 2 would produce a diol with OH groups on opposite faces, but again, due to symmetry, it would be meso.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the actual structure. The diol from Reaction 1 would have both OHs on the same face, with the molecule being symmetric. So the two stereocenters would have opposite configurations, making it a meso compound.

Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 would have both OHs on opposite faces, but again, the molecule would be symmetric, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, but then both diols would be meso compounds, which are achiral. So when combined, the mixture would contain two different meso compounds.

Wait, but are these two meso compounds different?

Wait, Reaction 1 gives a cis diol, which is a meso compound. Reaction 2 gives a trans diol, which is another meso compound.

Are these two diols the same? No, because their diol configurations are different.

Wait, but wait: no. Because the diol from Reaction 1 is a cis diol, and from Reaction 2 is a trans diol. So they are different products.

So, in total, when the products are combined, there would be two different diols: one cis (from E) and one trans (from Z), each being a meso compound and thus achiral.

So, when run on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, which doesn't separate enantiomers, each diol would elute as a single peak. So two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, which can separate enantiomers, each diol is achiral (meso), so each would still be a single peak. So again, two peaks.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

Wait, according to my previous reasoning, both diols are achiral, so on both columns, each would produce one peak. But since there are two diols, the standard HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

So that would correspond to option C: 2 peaks in both.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two stereoisomers. Let me re-examine.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide. When opened, the diol would have two stereocenters. If the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the diol is a single product.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have two stereocenters but be a meso compound. So, no chiral centers, hence achiral.

Similarly, in Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide. Upon ring-opening, the diol would have two stereocenters. If the epoxide is symmetric, the diol is a meso compound, hence achiral.

So the products are two different diols: one cis (meso) and one trans (meso). Both are achiral.

So, when run on an achiral HPLC, each would elute as a single peak. So two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, but since both diols are achiral (meso), each would still be a single peak. So again, two peaks.

So that would make option C correct: 2 peaks in both.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the diols from both reactions are different. The product from Reaction 1 is a cis-diol (meso), and the product from Reaction 2 is a trans-diol (meso). So they are two distinct compounds, each being achiral. Thus, when combined, the mixture has two compounds.

So, on the standard HPLC, which can't distinguish enantiomers, each compound would be a single peak. So two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since each is achiral, each would still be a single peak. So again, two peaks.

So, the correct answer is C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 2 in both. So the answer would be C.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each diol has multiple stereoisomers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. For the diol from Reaction 1: when the epoxide is symmetric, the ring-opening would produce a single product. Similarly for Reaction 2.

So, the products are two different diols, each achiral. So on any HPLC, each would be a single peak.

Thus, the standard HPLC (achiral) would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks. So the correct option is C.


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are combined and analyzed using both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - **Reaction 1**: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a trans epoxide. Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide produces a cis-diol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the diol is a meso compound (achiral).
   - **Reaction 2**: (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a cis epoxide. Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide produces a trans-diol. Similarly, the symmetry of the starting material ensures the diol is a meso compound (achiral).

2. **Products**:
   - Reaction 1 yields a cis-diol (meso compound).
   - Reaction 2 yields a trans-diol (meso compound).
   - Both diols are achiral because they are meso compounds.

3. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: This column does not separate enantiomers. Since both diols are achiral and distinct compounds, each will elute as a single peak. Therefore, two peaks are observed.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: This column separates enantiomers. However, since both diols are achiral (meso compounds), they will each elute as a single peak. Therefore, two peaks are observed.

### Conclusion:
The standard HPLC and chiral HPLC each show two peaks, corresponding to the two distinct achiral diols formed in the reactions.
