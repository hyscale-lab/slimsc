Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, first, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The complexes probably increase in the number of SCN- ligands attached. So, the complexes might be [Co(SCN)]^n- where n increases.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^n-. But wait, looking at the stability constants, β1 is 9, which I think is for the first formation step. So each β represents the formation of the next complex.

Wait, the stability constant β for each step. The first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+ (assuming Co²+ plus SCN- gives CoSCN^+). Then β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) = 9.

Similarly, β2 would be the formation of the next complex from the first. So [Co(SCN)₂]^n- divided by ([CoSCN+][SCN-]) )= β2 =40.

Wait, but maybe the β values are given as cumulative stability constants. No, wait, in some cases, β is given for each step, meaning β1 is K1 for the first step, β2 is K2 for the second, etc. Or sometimes they are given as overall constants, but I think in this problem, β1 is the first formation step, β2 is the second, etc. So each β is the stepwise formation constant.

So, the complexes will form in the order: Co²+ + SCN- ⇌ CoSCN+ (β1=9), then CoSCN+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂ (β2=40), then Co(SCN)₂ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)3 (β3=63), and then the next step β4=16.

Wait, but wait β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's a bit confusing. Because usually, each step's β might decrease, but not necessarily. If β4 is 16 for the fourth step, then the fourth complex would be [Co(SCN)4]^something.

Wait, but the problem is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex. So I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] relative to all other cobalt species.

So,
