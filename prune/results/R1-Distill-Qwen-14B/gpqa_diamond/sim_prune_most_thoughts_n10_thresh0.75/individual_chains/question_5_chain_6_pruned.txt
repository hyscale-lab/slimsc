Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to make sense of it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by matrices, and eigenvectors correspond to states with definite values when measured. So, the operator here is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me write down the given matrices. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). That matrix looks like [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Oh right, the operator P is a vector, so the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane can be written as a linear combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, the direction doesn't have a y-component, so the angle phi (azimuthal angle) is zero. So the direction can be parameterized by theta, the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So it's P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2, maybe I can express P·n in terms of the Pauli matrices and then find its eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are well-known.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of the spin operator in direction n would be |+> and |->, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector we're looking for is the |+> state along direction n.

The general form for the |+> state can be written in terms of the spherical basis. The spin-up state in direction (theta, phi) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓> 

But wait, in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, because the x-z plane corresponds to phi=0 or pi, depending on the direction. So phi is zero. So the state becomes:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Expressed as a column vector, this would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. Because the |↑> state is [1; 0], and |↓> is [0;1], right?

Wait, no. Wait, in the standard basis, the |↑> state is (1, 0) and |↓> is (0,1). So if the state is cos(theta/2)|↑> + sin(theta/2)|↓>, the vector would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But wait, actually, the state is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T. But phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1. So the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, the problem is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Well, since cos^2 + sin^2 =1, it's
