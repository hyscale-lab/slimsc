Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, an antiproton and a proton annihilating into two pairs of particles, A⁺ and A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. The mass of particle A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's think about their masses. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton has the same mass since it's the antimatter counterpart. So each has a rest energy of about 938 MeV.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. Or maybe it's just that its velocity is low, so we can approximate it as non-relativistic? Or perhaps, since it's moving slowly, we can consider it's non-relativistic, meaning v << c, so we can use non-relativistic equations for its motion.

Wait, but in the annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial system is the proton and the slow-moving antiproton. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low velocity relative to the lab frame.

So, in that case, the initial total energy would be the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has energy γ m_p c², but since it's moving slowly, γ is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but maybe we can approximate it as m_p c² plus its kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, maybe KE is much less than m_p c², so we can approximate the antiproton's energy as its rest mass plus a small kinetic energy.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, the rest mass is usually the dominant term. So perhaps the initial total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Because the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is approximately m_p c² as well, since it's moving slowly.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving, but it's slow. So perhaps we need to take into account its velocity. So, the initial momentum is due to the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. So initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton.

After annihilation, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. But how do they move? Well, the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, which could be either A⁺ or A⁻. Since the reaction is symmetric, perhaps all four particles are moving together as a system. Or maybe they're moving in pairs.

Wait, but the problem is probably assuming that the products (the two A⁺ and A⁻ each) are moving together in some symmetric way. Maybe all four particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up.

But wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So four particles. If the initial system is the proton and antiproton, which are colliding, the total momentum should be conserved. So initial momentum is the momentum of the moving antiproton (since the proton is at rest). After annihilation, the total momentum should be the sum of the momenta of the four particles.

Assuming that in the center of mass frame, but wait,
