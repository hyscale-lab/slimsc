Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about annihilation processes, which I remember from my studies. Hmm, the question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two A⁺ particles and two A⁻ particles. Oh right, so the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, so if it's moving slowly, does that mean its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy? Or maybe just that its speed is much less than the speed of light, so we can use non-relativistic approximations? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. And we need to find the velocity of the particles A. The options are various fractions of c, so the answer is definitely a relativistic speed.

First, I should figure out what's conserved in this process. Since the proton and antiproton are annihilating, I think that in the center of mass frame, the total energy and momentum should be considered. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, does that mean in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, protons and antiprotons are matter and antimatter, so their rest masses are the same. The proton is at rest? Or is the antiproton at rest? The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps in the lab frame, the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. But wait, in reality, when a proton and antiproton collide, they annihilate into other particles. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's a non-relativistic scenario. Hmm.

Wait, but the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. That's four particles. So I need to think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial momentum is only from the moving antiproton (assuming the proton is at rest), the total initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton.

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero because the incoming particles are moving towards each other. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the lab frame is the same
