Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's see... The options are A, B, C, D. Let me break down each piece of data and see what they tell me.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and a peak at 158 with 32%. Wait, molecular ion usually corresponds to the molecular weight. So, the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. The 158 peak is probably an isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35.5, so maybe there's Cl in the molecule because Cl has a significant natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope, and 25% for 37Cl. So, the molecular ion at 156 and the 158 peak would correspond to the two isotopic peaks. So 156 would be the most abundant (35Cl), and 158 would be the 37Cl isotope. That suggests the molecule has one Cl atom. So the molecular weight is 156, with a Cl in it.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But looking more closely, the broad peak here is in that range. O-H stretch is usually around 3200-3600. But wait, the peak is broad, which could be an -OH group. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. Wait, the broad peak is from 3500-2700. Hmm, maybe it's a carbonyl group but I don't think so. Another thought: maybe it's an alcohol? No, because the IR also shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, what kinds of carbonyls are there? Carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 but can be lower. An ester or a ketone? Hmm, but what's the broad peak? If the peak is broad, perhaps it's an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. So maybe a carboxylic acid?

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's look at the signals:

- 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. That's a very high chemical shift, which is typically for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but can go up to around 10.5. Wait, 11 is very high. Alternatively, it could be an exchangeable proton like -OH in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they can be broad. Wait, but in
