Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles produced in a decay process. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think this through step by step.

The problem states that a Pi+ (pion) at rest decays into a muon+ (mu) and a neutrino (nu). The given rest masses are Pi+ at 139.6 MeV and muon+ at 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values, probably for the muon and the neutrino.

First, I remember that in particle decay problems, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. This implies that the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass (I think they're considered massless in many problems, or at least their mass is negligible compared to other particles here). But in this case, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6 MeV. So the neutrino's energy and momentum can't be completely ignored, but maybe in this case, the problem assumes it's massless or we can calculate using relativistic equations.

The key here is to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me outline what I know:

1. The rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. So the total energy before decay is 139.6 MeV.

2. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

3. From momentum conservation, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Let's denote this common magnitude as p.

4. For the muon, its energy is given by the relativistic formula: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no. Wait, the units here are all in MeV. Oh wait, actually, since we're dealing in natural units where c=1, the formula simplifies. So E_mu^2 = p^2 + (m_mu)^2. So E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2).

5. For the neutrino, if it's massless, E_nu = p. But if it has a mass, E_nu would be sqrt(p^2 + m_nu^2). But I think in most problems, especially at this level, neutrinos are treated as massless. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So E_nu = p.

So now, the two equations are:

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV,

and

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )

E_nu = p.

Substituting E_nu into the first equation:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

This looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let me denote x = p.

So sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, to solve for x, I can rearrange the equation:

sqrt(x^2 + a^2) = b - x, where a is 105.7 and b is 139.6.

Square both sides:

x^2 + a² = (b - x)^2 = b² - 2bx + x².

Cancel x² from both sides:

a² = b² - 2bx.

Then, 2bx = b² -a².

So x = (b² - a²)/(2b).

Plugging in the numbers:

b = 139.6, a = 105.7.

b² is (139.6)^2. Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 is approximately (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a² is (105.7)^2. 100² is 10000, 5.7² is about 32.49, and 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So b² - a² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then, 2b = 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2 =8096.8. That's more than 8315.67. So maybe 29 is too high.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 ≈ 8096.8 as above. 8315.67 - 8096.8=218.87.

So 29 + 218.87 / 279.2.

218.87/279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV.

Wait, wait, but our equation was x = (b² -a²)/(2b) → so x ≈ (8315.67) / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So E_nu = x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu = sqrt( x² + a² ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculating 29.78^2: 30^2 is 900, so 29.78^2 is about (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.85.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait—this can't be right because E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass. The rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy would be E_mu - m_mu.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is E_nu = 29.78 MeV, which is all kinetic because it's massless (or negligible mass). So the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are each giving two KE values. So looking at the options:

Option B: 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV.

Wait, no. Let me look:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Yes, because 4.12 is close to 4.11, and 29.8 is close to 29.78.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic.

Let me recompute x = (b² -a²)/(2b).

b is 139.6 MeV, so b² is (139.6)^2 = let me compute more accurately.

139.6 *139.6: Let's compute this.

Let me compute 139 * 139 = 19321, then 0.6 * 139.6 = 83.76. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it as (140 -0.4)^2.

(140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So that's correct.

a =105.7 MeV, a²=11172.49.

So x = (19488.16 -11172.49) / (2 *139.6 )

Which is (8315.67) / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

But 8315.67 is larger than 8096.8, so 29 is too low.

Wait, 279.2 *29 =8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 /279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So x ≈29 +0.783 =29.783 MeV.

So E_nu =29.783 MeV → KE is same as E since it's massless.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.783^2: 29.783 *29.783. Let me compute
