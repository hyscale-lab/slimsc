Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because optical activity isn't my strongest topic. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and I need to check each one for chirality, which is what causes optical activity. Chirality, if I remember right, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, a molecule can be chiral without a chiral center, like in allenes or some other structures, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

Let me list out the compounds again and analyze each one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Structure: The molecule is a butene with a double bond starting at C1. At C1, there's a Cl and a CH2CH2 group (since it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2). The substituents on each carbon of the double bond (C1 and C2) would be Cl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but wait, for a double bond, the geometry is Z or E. But what about the substituents?

Optical activity: For the molecule to be optically active, it must have a chiral center. Let me look at each carbon. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)2? Or wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So C1 is Cl, CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is the same carbon as the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CHCH3? Wait, not sure. Let me think: The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2CH2, so maybe more accurately, it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So structure is ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, because it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but that would be 1-chloro-2-methylpropene, but it's but-1-ene, so perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, making it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? But that's a single bond. But this is but-1-ene, with a double bond. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl: Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? But that's without the double bond. Wait, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Oh, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C1 has Cl, C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3. Wait, that can't be because but-1-ene is four carbons: C1, C2, C3, C4. So but-1-ene is C1-C2 double bond, C2 is connected to C3 and C4. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So would C1 have Cl, double bond to C2 (CH(CH3)), and two other substituents? Wait, C1 is CH2Cl? No, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, and is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

But regardless, the main point is whether any of the carbons in this molecule have four different substituents. Let's look at each carbon. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, two Hs (if it's CH2Cl?), and a double bond. Wait, but for a double bond, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2CH3, but again I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's single bonds.

Wait, maybe this structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-1-ene is four carbons, CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's without the double bond. Oh wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1: Cl, double bond (so two substituents), and two CH3 groups? No, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe it's better to think about whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

If the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3, then the C1 is Cl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C3 or C4 have four substituents. Wait, but I'm not seeing any chiral centers here. Because if the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3, then C2 is CH3, and C3 is CH2CH3. Maybe no chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Then C2 is CH2, which doesn't have four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's best to tentatively say that this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical activity. Alternatively, maybe there's a possibility of a double bond configuration leading to different structures, but not chirality. So I'll mark this as no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So benzofuran is a fused ring system, and here it's methano, meaning a methylene bridge connecting positions 4 and 7. Hexahydro suggests that some of the rings are hydrogenated. The substituent is chloromethylene at position 8, in the E configuration.

The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). So the molecule has rings with specific substituents. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The E configuration on the methylene group (Cl-CH2-) attached to the ring. The positions 3a and 7a have R and S configurations, respectively. So they are chiral centers. Thus, this molecule has chiral centers, so it should be optically active. So yes, this compound exhibits optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the two central carbons each have a methyl group. Now, checking for chiral centers. The C2 has groups: two CH3, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, no. Let's see, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two methyl groups, a COOH, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, succinic acid is four carbons, so positions 2 and 3 are the middle two. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with two methyl groups on C2 and C3. So when you add a methyl to each, the structure becomes:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3), the substituents are: COOH, CH3, CH(CH3), and another CH(CH3)? Wait, no, each carbon in the chain:

C1: COOH, CH2.

Wait, perhaps better to think of the structure as:

OOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COO^- (but in acid form, so OOH groups).

Wait, each of the C2 and C3 in the acid. For C2: substituents are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) on C3,
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have the following groups:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Each of C2 and C3 is a carbon connected to:

- C1 (COOH), no, because C1 is the first carbon, and C2 is the second.

Wait, for C2: groups are:

- A COOH group (from C1, but actually, C1 is the first carbon so C2 is the second, so it's attached to C1, which is COOH, C3, which is CH(CH3), and two methyl groups? Wait, no, because it's 2,3-dimethyl, so C2 has a methyl, and C3 has a methyl. So C2's substituents are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- two methyl groups? No, because C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list the substituents for each carbon. Let's consider C2: it's attached to:

- Carbon 1: which is COOH,
- Carbon 3: which is CH(CH3),
- and two other groups: a CH3 (since it's 2-methyl) and another group? Wait, no, because each carbon in a chain has four bonds. So, for C2:

Groups attached:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- CH3 (from the methyl),
- and another H?

Wait, but wait, that would make four substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So, four different groups? Let me see: COOH is a carboxylic acid group, CH(CH3) is a CH with a methyl, CH3 is another methyl, and H. Wait, no, because the CH3 (methyl) is a substituent, but the H is another. So C2 has COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. Are these all different? COOH is a group, CH(CH3) is a CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, COOH is a substituent, CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to C3, which has another methyl. But wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so the groups are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- CH3 (the methyl substituent),
- and another H.

So the substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. Are these four different? COOH is a group, CH(CH3) is a substituent, CH3 is another, and H is another. So yes, four different substituents. So C2 is a chiral center.

Similarly, C3: It's connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (COOH), and two substituents. Wait, no, C3 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have groups:

- C2 (CH(CH3)),
- C4 (COOH),
- CH3 (from the methyl),
- and another H.

So substituents: CH(CH3), COOH, CH3, and H. Again, four different groups. So C3 is also a chiral center. But wait, this molecule is (2R,3S), so both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers, making it chiral. Therefore, it is optically active. So this compound counts.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Same structure as the previous compound but with (2R,3R) configuration. So the same analysis applies. Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. So the molecule is chiral. So this compound is also optically active.

Wait, but wait, in the previous case, the configuration was (2R,3S). Here, both R. So the molecule is chiral because each center is chiral, regardless of their configuration. So yes, this compound is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
The structure is a cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4?), with an OH group on C1 and the configuration R. Now, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (so numbering starts with the OH on C1). So the ring is cyclohexene, and the OH is on C1. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

C1 has the OH group. Let's see the substituents on C1. In a cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (since it's a six-membered ring). Additionally, it has the OH group. So substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- C6 (which is CH2),
- and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, no, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C1's substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- and the ring's double bond doesn't directly affect C1's substituents. Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring's structure affects the substituents. So C1 is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
- OH,
- and the ring's other bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure more clearly. The cyclohexene has double bond C3-C4. The OH is on C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- and the ring's other two bonds, which are connected to adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two other ring carbons and two substituents. For C1, the substituents are OH and three other groups? No, wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon has two ring bonds (to adjacent carbons) and two substituents. For C1, substituents are OH and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6?), but wait, that can't be right because C2 is part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again. In a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So for C1:

- Two bonds to ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- One bond to OH,
- And the fourth bond would be to a hydrogen if it's a chair conformation. But wait, in cyclohexene, some positions may have double bonds, but C1 is single-bonded to C2 and C6.

Wait, but if C1 is attached to two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), an OH, and a hydrogen, then the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. Are these four different groups?

Wait, C1's substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2- (from C2),
- CH2- (from C6),
- H.

Are the two CH2 groups the same? Because C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups in the ring. So the substituents would be OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. So the substituents are not all different; two are the same. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active. Wait, but wait, what about the double bond in cyclohexene?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that creates a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is such that the ring is not flat, but for the sake of substituents on C1, I think the analysis holds. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol doesn't have a chiral center because two substituents are the same. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The molecule has the OH on C1. The substituents are:

- OH,
- Ring to C2,
- Ring to C6,
- And another substituent, which is a hydrogen.

But wait, no, in a cyclohexene, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds. So the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6, which are each CH2 because the double bond is elsewhere),
- And a hydrogen.

So four substituents, but two are CH2 groups. So they are the same. Hence, C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have optical activity.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is (R) configuration. That implies that the carbon is chiral. But if it's not a chiral center, then how can it have R configuration? I must be making a mistake here.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the substituents. Let me try again. The structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1.

So the ring is six-membered. Let me visualize the chair conformation. C1 is axial or equatorial, but perhaps that's not relevant. The substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but C2 and C6 are each connected to C1 via single bonds. So C2 is connected to C1, C3, and perhaps a CH2 group. But in the ring, each of C2 and C6 would have two ring bonds and two substituents. But for C1, substituents are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- C6 (which is CH2),
- and H.

So yes, two substituents are CH2 groups, making them identical. So C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical activity. Wait, but the question says (R) configuration. So perhaps I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is in a position that creates a different environment. Let me think: Could the double bond lead to some sort of E/Z isomerism, but that's about geometry, not chirality. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the OH is on a carbon that's part of a ring, making it a chiral center when considering the ring structure.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is a cyclohexene with an OH group on C1. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is such that C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (both CH2 groups), OH, and H. So substituents are OH, CH2, CH2, H. Not four distinct groups. So no chiral center, so no optical activity.

Hmm, but the question states (R) configuration. That suggests that there's a chiral center. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Maybe the substituents are different.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, C1 is connected to:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- and a CH group from the double bond.

No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between C3 and C4, not involving C1 or C2.

Another possibility: perhaps the cyclohexene ring is substituted in such a way that C1 is connected to two different substituents. Let me think about the structure again. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is such that C1 has two different substituents: for example, one CH2 and another group that is part of the double bond. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. I'll tentatively say that this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical activity.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is (1s,3s,5s). Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers?

Each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) has how many different substituents?

For C1: substituents are OH, C2 (CH2), C6 (CH2), and another H or substituent. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. For C1, substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- and a hydrogen.

So substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), so C1 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would have the same substituents. Therefore, none of the OH-bearing carbons are chiral centers. So the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement creates a chiral center elsewhere. But each of the OH-bearing carbons has two identical substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups), so no, they're not chiral.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a butanone (four carbons, ketone on C1) with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl group on C3.

Structure: 

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-(cyclopentyl) ?

Wait, no. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C5H9 (cyclopentyl group as substituent on C1?), no, wait, but the substituents would be on C1 and C3. Wait, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So the ketone is on C1, which also has a cyclopentyl group. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 ?

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (which is the carbonyl carbon), then C2, C3, and C4.

Wait, more accurately:

The molecule is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, because butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So:

Butan-1-one: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

In this case, substituents are at C1 and C3. So:

At C1 (the carbonyl carbon), it's attached to a cyclopentyl group and the ketone O. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, the substituent is on C1. Let me think again.

Butan-1-one structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So:

- At C1 (the carbonyl carbon), there's a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, no. Let's parse the substituents.

Butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone on C1. The substituents are:

At C1: cyclopentyl and the ketone O (since it's a carbonyl, so C=O).

At C3: a methyl group.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, that can't be because butan-1-one has four carbons. So, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But with substituents on C1 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Cyclopentyl group on C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3).

Wait, no, because that would be three carbons after the carbonyl. Let me count. The carbonyl is C1, then C2, C3, C4. So the structure is:

C1: O=C-

C2: connected to C1 and C3.

C3: connected to C2, C4, and a methyl group.

C4: connected to C3 and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, but the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, so:

The substituents are:

- On C1 (carbonyl carbon): cyclopentyl group.

- On C3: methyl group.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but that would make it a five-carbon chain, which doesn't fit the butanone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of butan-1-one as a four-carbon chain with the ketone on C1. So:

C1: O=C-

C2: CH2-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2- attached to cyclopentyl.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on C4, which is the fourth carbon. But the name says 1-cyclopentyl, so it's on C1.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH3.

But that would be a five-carbon chain, but butanone is four carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should focus on whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at each carbon:

C1: O=C-, connected to C2 and the cyclopentyl group. Since it's a carbonyl, it's double-bonded, so no chiral center.

C2: connected to O=C-, C3, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's connected to C1, C3, and two CH2 groups. So substituents: O=C- (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two H's. Wait, no, perhaps C2 is CH2, so substituents would be O=C-, CH2, H, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure can be written as:

O=C(C5H9)CH2CH(CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, but I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. Let's imagine the molecule is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9 (cyclopentyl). So:

C1: O=C, connected to C2 and cyclopentyl.

C2: CH2, connected to C1, C3, and two H's.

C3: CH(CH3), connected to C2, C4, and two substituents (methyl and another).

C4: CH2, connected to C3 and C5H9.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So:

- The carbonyl is on C1.

- C1 is also attached to cyclopentyl.

- C3 has a methyl group.

So the structure is:

O=C(C5H9) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons: C1 (O=C(C5H9)), C2 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), and C4 (CH3). So yes, four carbons in the butanone.

So the substituents on each carbon:

C1: O=C, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, so it can't have four substituents. Wait, that's a mistake. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it has two substituents: one from the ring (cyclopentyl) and one from the C2. So C1 is connected to cyclopentyl, C2, and O. Therefore, no chiral center here.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3, two H's. So substituents: O=C-, CH(CH3), two H's. So substituents are O=C-, CH(CH3), H, H. That's three substituents, so not four, so no chiral center.

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group, and a H. So substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and H. So substituents are CH2, CH3, CH3, H. So two substituents are the same (CH3), so C3 is not a chiral center.

C4: connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), and three H's. So substituents: CH(CH3), H, H, H. So no chiral center.

Wait, but wait, C3 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- C2 (CH2),
- C4 (CH3),
- methyl (CH3),
- and a H.

So substituents: CH2, CH3, CH3, H. So two CH3 groups, so not four different. Hence, no chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps I've made an error. Let me check again. C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), a methyl group (CH3), and a H. So substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- CH3 (substituent),
- H.

So two substituents are CH3, so C3 is not a chiral center.

Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the cyclopentyl group is on a different carbon, but from the name, it's on C1. So no, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, to recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes, has chiral centers. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers. Optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: No chiral centers. Not active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No chiral centers. Not active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. Not active.

So which compounds are optically active? Compounds 2, 3, and 4. That's three.

Wait, but let me double-check compound 5. I thought it didn't have a chiral center, but the question says (R) configuration. Could I have made a mistake there?

Compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So two substituents are the same (CH2 groups), making C1 not a chiral center. So no, it's not active. So that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 3: compounds 2, 3, and 4.

Wait, but looking back, I think compound 2 is (3aR,7aS,E)... which has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), so it's chiral. So that's correct.

So, the answer is 3 compounds exhibit optical activity. Looking at the options, option B is 3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits chirality through other means, such as planar chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with no chiral centers. The substituents on the carbons of the double bond are not all different, and no carbon in the molecule has four distinct groups.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains a fused ring system with specific stereochemistry. The positions 3a and 7a are chiral centers, as they are bonded to four different groups. The molecule is chiral due to these chiral centers.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has four carbons, with carboxylic acid groups at positions 1 and 4. The central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and are bonded to four different groups: COOH, CH3, H, and the adjacent carbon. Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers.  
   **Optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is structurally identical to the previous one, with the same chiral centers at C2 and C3. The specific stereochemistry does not affect the presence of chirality.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1. The substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. Since two substituents are identical (CH2 groups), C1 is not a chiral center.  
   **Not optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each OH-bearing carbon is bonded to two identical CH2 groups, making them non-chiral. The molecule lacks any chiral centers.  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound is a butanone with a cyclopentyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 3. None of the carbons in the molecule have four different substituents. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center.  
   **Not optically active.**

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **2, 3, and 4**, for a total of **3** optically active compounds.
