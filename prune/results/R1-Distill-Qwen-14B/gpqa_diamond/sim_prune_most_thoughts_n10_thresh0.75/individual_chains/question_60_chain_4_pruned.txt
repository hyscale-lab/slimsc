Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The aliens are from the Large Magellanic Cloud, which I remember is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Their spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before reaching, or how many years they'll live during the trip.

Wait, the question is about time dilation, right? Because when you travel at such high speeds, time passes differently for the traveler compared to someone stationary relative to Earth. Oh right, that's the theory of relativity, specifically special relativity. So the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) will be less than the time observed from Earth or another frame.

First, I need to find out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact distance. Do I remember the distance to the LMC? I think it's about 160,000 light-years away. Yeah, I've heard that before. So the distance D is roughly 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let's compute the time from Earth's frame of reference first. From Earth's perspective, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So time t_earth = D / v. Let me plug in the numbers.

D is 160,000 light-years. The speed v is 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, dividing by c (which is 1 light-year/year) would give time in years.

So t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute that. 160,000 divided by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is almost 1). Wait, but 0.99999987 is just a tiny bit less than 1. Let me see: 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So it's 13e-8 less than 1.

So 160,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013), because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. So that's about 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013). Let's calculate that second term: 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 0.0208. So t_earth ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years from Earth's frame.

But wait, that's a really long time. The astronaut is 22 years old. Their average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, that's way beyond their lifespan. But wait, that's from Earth's frame. From the astronaut's frame, the time would be less because of time dilation.

So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the traveling frame. The formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or more accurately, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so t' = t / gamma.

Wait, let me get the formula correct. Proper time (tau) is the time in the moving frame, so tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

But v is 0.99999987c. So v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately (since it's very close to 1). Let me compute it:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000
