Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the operator, right? Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives the spin state as (3i, 4). Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually written as column vectors. So (3i, 4) would be a vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. So ψ is a two-component vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

The operator for spin in the y-direction is given as σ_y. The matrix for σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli matrix for y. So S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y because spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2)*σ_y.

The expectation value is the bra-ket ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I need to compute this.

Wait, so let's break it down step by step. First, I should write the vector ψ. Since it's a column vector, I can write it as:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Wait, but wait—wait a second, perhaps the order is different? Because sometimes the spin states are written as (up, down), but I'm not sure. But the exact order probably doesn't matter for the calculation; I just need to proceed.

So to compute ⟨S_y⟩, which is expectation value of S_y, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, no, wait—actually, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. But I have to be careful with the order because the dagger represents the conjugate transpose.

Wait, let's correct that. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So first, I need to compute S_y multiplied by |ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

Alternatively, another way is to compute ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

But wait, since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, I can factor that out. So:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩
