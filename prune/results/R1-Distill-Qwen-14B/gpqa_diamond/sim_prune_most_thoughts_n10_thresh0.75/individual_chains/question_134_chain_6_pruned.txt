Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy change. The options are given in kcal and kJ, which is a bit confusing because I thought enthalpy is usually in kJ in my studies. But maybe it's just the way the question is presented.

Wait, first, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, usually measured in kJ/mol. For strong acids and bases, it's around -57 kJ/mol per mole of H+ or OH- ions, I think.

But wait, the problem mixes three solutions. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are present, but also consider the stoichiometry of the reaction because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base with two OH- ions per formula unit.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each reactant.

Starting with HCl: it's a monoprotic acid. Moles = Molarity × Volume(L). So, 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So HCl has 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then Ba(OH)2: each mole gives 2 OH- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, when acid and base react, the H+ and OH- combine 1:1. So the reaction will proceed until one runs out. Let's see which one is in excess.

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.08 left.

The neutralization reaction between H2SO4, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but these are all in solution, so perhaps the reaction is between the H+ ions and OH- ions, regardless of their source.

So the reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change per mole is around -57 kJ (but wait, I think the value is typically -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized). So for each mole of H+ that reacts with OH-, it releases 57 kJ.

So how much H+ reacts? Well, since OH- is 0.2 moles, all of it will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So the total H+ is 0.28, but only 0.2 reacts. The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ will remain in solution.

But wait, the
