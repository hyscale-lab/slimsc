Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out which system is more massive. Let's see... The problem gives me some data about their periods and radial velocities.

Alright, so the two systems are system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period here is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh, and the radial velocity (RV) variations in system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity changes are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the ratio of the velocities is inverse to the mass ratio. Like, if one star is more massive, it doesn't move as much.

The mass function comes into play here. The formula I think is something like (v1^3 + v2^3) divided by the total velocity (v1 + v2) to the first power, all multiplied by (1/(2πG)) and something with the period. Wait, maybe I should think about the mass function formula.

Wait, Newton's form for binary stars: the mass function f(M) = (v1^3 * P) / (2πG), where P is the orbital period. But since both stars are orbiting the same center, the mass function for each star depends on the mass of the other and the mass ratio. But maybe a better approach is to consider the mass ratio.

Wait, another approach. The masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. Because the center of mass requires m1*v1 = m2*v2. So m1/m2 = v2/v1. Oh right, because m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, but a is proportional to velocity over period or something. Wait, no. Wait, the center of mass condition is m1*r1 = m2*r2, where r is the radius of orbit. And velocity is v = 2πr / P. So, v1 = (2
