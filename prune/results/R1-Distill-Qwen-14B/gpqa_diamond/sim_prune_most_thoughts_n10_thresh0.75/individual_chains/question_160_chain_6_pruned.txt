Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem talks about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and in the far field, it creates intensity maxima and minima. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. We can use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) ≈ theta.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with diffraction patterns, the shape of the aperture affects the resulting pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but in this case, it's a polygon with a very large number of sides, N. So as N becomes infinitely large, the polygon would approximate a circle, but I think the diffraction pattern might be similar to that of a single slit or perhaps a circular aperture. Wait, no, for a single slit, the pattern is different. Or maybe it's more about the number of sides leading to multiple slits?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says all apothems are the same length a. So each side of the polygon is at a distance a from the center. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So the shape is regular.

But when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides would be a smooth circle. So maybe the problem is approximating the circular aperture case. But wait, for a circular aperture, the pattern is the familiar Airy disk, where the first minimum is at a certain angle. But wait, the options given don't seem to match the standard formula for a circular aperture. Wait, the standard formula for the first minimum in a single-slit (rectangular) diffraction is sin(theta) = λ/(a), but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at sin(theta) ≈ 1.22 λ / (diameter). Hmm.

Wait, but this is about a polygon with N sides, so maybe it's not a single slit but a multi-slit scenario? Or perhaps it's similar to a circular aperture but with a different number of points
