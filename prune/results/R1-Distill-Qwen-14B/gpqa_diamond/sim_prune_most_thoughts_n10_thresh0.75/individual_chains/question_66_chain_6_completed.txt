Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are numbered 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these.

Hmm. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These operators are classified by their dimension, with each operator being a product of SM fields, Lorentz-invariant tensors, and derivatives. 

Wait, the symmetries. The question is about which symmetries are respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, which symmetries are necessarily upheld by the theory as a whole, meaning any operator included must preserve them.

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. So operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. That means Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it should also respect Poincaré. SMEFT includes terms like derivatives, which are part of the Poincaré generators. So Poincaré symmetry must be preserved as well.

3. CP symmetry: CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. I'm not so sure about this one. In the Standard Model, some interactions do violate CP, like in the electroweak sector. But when adding operators to SMEFT, do they have to respect CP? I think CP isn't necessarily a symmetry that SMEFT operators have to preserve. Because SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP if the underlying physics does. For example, certain higher-dimension operators could break CP. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 might not be a must.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the theory's S-matrix is unitary and Lorentz-invariant, leading to CPT symmetry. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Putting it together: The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. CP (3) is not necessarily required.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian, which must respect certain symmetries. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is fundamental and must be preserved.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and incorporates derivatives (which are part of the Poincaré generators), Poincaré symmetry is also preserved.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation and parity. While CP is respected in some contexts, SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily required to be preserved by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not universally required. The correct answer is:

Answer: C
