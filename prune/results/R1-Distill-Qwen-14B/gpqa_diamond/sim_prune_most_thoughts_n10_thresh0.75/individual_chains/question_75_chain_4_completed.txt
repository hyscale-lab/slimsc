Okay, so I have this question about a failed experiment with transgenic mice and GADD45G protein overexpression. Hmm, let me try to break this down. So the researcher is trying to create a mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. They modified the gene's coding sequence to add an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are using antibiotic resistance to select the colonies. But the problem is they can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The question gives the sequence of the plus strand of their construct. Let me look at that. Oh wait, the sequence is a long string of nucleotides. I'm a bit rusty on reading DNA sequences, but I know that the start codon is ATG. Let me scan for that. Looking through the sequence, I see 'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'. 

Wait, I need to find if there's a start codon and then look for any possible issues. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. Now, looking for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) because that would stop translation early.

Let me scan the sequence for these. The entire sequence is in the plus strand, so I'll read it as the coding (non-template) strand. Let me go through it.

Looking at the sequence:

...ATG TAC CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Hmm, let's look for the stop codons. I'll scan each triplet.

Starting from the beginning after ATG:

TAC is Tyr (no stop). Next, CC A etc. Let me pick every three letters:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, this is getting too long. Maybe I should look for any of the stop codons in the sequence.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the triplets, let me see:

- Any TAG? I see at position 23: TAG, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, position 23 is TAG.

Let me check that again. The triplets start at position 1 as ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), etc.

Wait, position 23 would be triplet 8: let me recount. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in numbering. Let me think.

Wait, the triplet positions are 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, etc.

Looking for any TAG, TAA, TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

- The 10th triplet (positions 28-30): TAC GAT GCT? No.

Wait, looking at the initial parts:

...ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, I see the sequence has "TGA" near the end. Let me look: "...CGAGTGA". So that's the last part. So that's a TGA at the very end, which is a stop codon. So the last triplet is TGA.

But wait, in a gene construct, the stop codon is usually after the coding region. So if the construct has a TGA stop codon in the middle, that would cause the translation to terminate early.

Looking through the sequence again, let's see if any triplet is TAA, TAG, or TGA before the intended stop.

Looking at the first half:

Looking for TGA, I see that early on at position 13-15: GAT (no), later on, another TGA appears. Let me see.

Wait, in the sequence, after ATG, I see TAC, then CCC, then TAC, GAT, GTT, etc. Oh, wait, looking further, I see "TGA" in the middle. Let me find where.

Looking from the start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTT GGA AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, here at the 12th triplet: positions 34-36: "TGA". So triplet 12 is TGA. Because:

positions 32-34: AAA, then 35-37: TGA.

Yes! So the 12th triplet is TGA. Which is a stop codon. So that's a problem because the ribosome would stop translating at that point.

So the construct has an in-frame stop codon in the middle, which causes the premature termination of translation. Therefore, the protein isn't expressed because the ribosome stops early.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That might affect the protein function but not necessarily prevent expression. But in the given data, the sequence doesn't show any frameshift or extra stop before the HA. So maybe not.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That's exactly what I think is happening because of the TGA stop codon.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If the protein is not made, proteolysis wouldn't matter. So probably not the issue here.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, but the stop codon here is TGA, which is recognized by release factors. So that's not the issue.

So the problem is that the coding sequence includes a TGA stop codon, causing early termination. So option B is the reason why the protein isn't expressed.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the TGA is in the middle, so the mRNA would have a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, not overexpression. But the question says the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So if the protein is not made, it's possible that the construct has a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the start codon is missing, but the sequence starts with ATG, so that's fine.

Another possibility: maybe the reading frame is shifted, but the question says they introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the frame should be correct.

So the main issue is the presence of a stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to premature termination. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an HA tag in a transgenic mouse model but fails to do so. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence contains an in-frame stop codon, specifically **TGA**, located at positions 35â€“37. This stop codon appears prematurely in the sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. As a result, the full-length protein is not expressed, which explains the failure to overexpress the protein.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence could affect protein function, but it would not prevent protein expression entirely. The sequence does not indicate any such mutation that would cause premature termination.
- **Option B:** The presence of the **TGA** stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence is the root cause. This stop codon halts translation prematurely, preventing the production of the full-length protein.
- **Option C:** The lack of a linker sequence might lead to proteolysis, but proteolysis would not prevent the expression of the protein entirely. The issue here is the absence of the protein due to premature termination.
- **Option D:** The tRNA for the **UAA** codon is not relevant because the premature stop codon in the sequence is **TGA**, not **TAA** or **TAG**. Additionally, the presence of a stop codon is the primary issue, not the availability of tRNA.

The key issue is the premature stop codon (**TGA**) in the coding sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the failure of GADD45G protein overexpression.

**Answer: B**
