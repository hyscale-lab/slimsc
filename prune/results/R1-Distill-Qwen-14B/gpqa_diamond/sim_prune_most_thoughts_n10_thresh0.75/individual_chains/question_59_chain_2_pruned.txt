Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the key is to figure out the excess after they neutralize each other. So first, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let me start with each solution.

First, CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. Then, HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they'll neutralize each other. But here, we have two acids and one base. So I need to see how much acid and base there is in total.

Wait, no, wait. The total volume is the sum of all three solutions. But the moles of H+ from the acids and OH- from the base will determine the excess. Because when you mix them all, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base, and whatever is in excess will determine the pH.

So, let's find the moles of each.

Moles of CH3COOH: volume (L) multiplied by concentration. 500 mL is 0.5 L. So 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, but when mixed with a base, perhaps it will contribute H+ ions? Or wait, in this case, are we considering each acid separately contributing H+?

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from both CH3COOH and HCl will be in the same solution, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will be in the same solution. So all H+ and OH- will react.

So the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH
