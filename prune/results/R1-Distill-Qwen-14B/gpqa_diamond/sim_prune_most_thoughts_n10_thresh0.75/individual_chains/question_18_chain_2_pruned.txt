Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. Using the EW method under LTE, their elemental abundances are given. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photosphere composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

I think I need to find [Si/H] for both stars and then find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2, which would be [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which I believe is [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2. Or wait, maybe [Si/H] in terms of their abundance compared to the Sun. Hmm.

Let me think about how to compute [X/H] for each star. The notation [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) relative to the Sun, I think. Or wait, no—wait, [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) − log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log_sun(nX/nY) = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) ) = log( (nX / nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) )

So for example, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_star1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → which would mean that nFe/nH is same as in Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe/nH for Star_1 is equal to solar value.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg/nH for Star_2 is same as solar.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0 by definition, so that's consistent.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe/nH = solar. So nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 as per Sun's data.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe/nH is solar.

Compute nSi/nFe for Star_1.

Let me write the formula: [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_star1 / nFe_star1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So (nSi1 / nFe1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But for Star_1, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1/nH_sun).

Wait, but [
