Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. And there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be solved using separation of variables, especially in polar coordinates since the problem is two-dimensional. So maybe I should consider the form of the potential and see if it can be broken down into radial and angular parts.

Looking at the potential, V(r,θ) has two terms: (1/2)kr² is just a radial term, right? Because it depends only on r. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Oh yeah, cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, combining the first and second terms, which are the constant terms in r². So 1/2 +3/4 is 5/4, so V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Hmm, but maybe I should factor out kr². So V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the potential as a sum of harmonic oscillator potentials. Because the harmonic oscillator in 2D can have radial and angular components. Oh wait, but wait. Let me think about this.

In two dimensions, the potential could be expressed in terms of polar coordinates. The solution for the energy levels in a 2D harmonic oscillator might be relevant here. For a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator (where the potential is (1/2) m ω² r²), the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω, where n_x and n_y are quantum
