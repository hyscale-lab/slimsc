Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, so a positively charged pion is decaying into a positive muon and a neutrino. And importantly, the pion is at rest. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A through D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they're neutral and super light. I think their rest mass is considered negligible in these kinds of problems. So when calculating, I can just ignore the neutrino's rest mass. That's probably going to simplify things.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. Which means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Now, the energy and momentum are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since we're dealing in units where c is 1 (because MeV is energy, and we're using units where c=1 for simplicity), the equation simplifies to E² = p² + m².

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but since they have opposite directions, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, I can just take their magnitudes as equal.

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The pion's rest energy is its mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So, the total energy of the products must be equal to this, because energy is conserved.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu is sqrt(p² + m_nu²). But wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, so m_nu is approximately zero. So E_nu is approximately p. Because sqrt(p² + 0) is p. So E_nu ≈ p.

So putting that into the energy equation: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = 139.6 MeV.

We know the muon's mass is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu = 105.7. Let me write that down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now I
