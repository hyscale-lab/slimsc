Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, the question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the question. Each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled a to d, and the answer choices are A to D, each corresponding to one option. The question is about density, so I remember that density is mass divided by volume.

Wait, but how do mass and radius relate to density? Oh right, because for a planet, the volume depends on its radius. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if two planets have the same mass, the one with a smaller radius would be denser because volume is smaller, making density higher (density = mass/volume).

But looking at the options, each is described in different ways. Let's go through them one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So option a would have that density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So if a planet has 2 Earth masses but same density, then its volume (and hence radius) would be larger. Because density is mass/volume, so if density is same as Earth, mass is double, volume must be double too. Since volume scales with radius cubed, so the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But the main point is that its density is 5.5, same as a. So option b's density is same as a's.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm, same composition implies same density, right? Because the composition affects the overall density. For example, if it's made of the same materials as Earth, the density would be similar. So if Earth has a density of 5.5, this planet would have the same. But wait, this planet is more massive. So how does mass affect density when composition is same? Since density is based on mass and volume, and mass is scaling, but if the composition is same, the density remains the same. So this planet's density is 5.5 as well.

Wait wait, but wait, if the planet is more massive but made of same stuff, the density remains same. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Similar to option c, same composition, so same density. So 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but that can't be right because all options a, b, c, d would have the same density. But the question says which has the highest. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, so density 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5. So same density as Earth.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times Earth mass. So same density as
