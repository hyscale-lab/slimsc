Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question involves two reactions and analyzing the products using chromatography. Let's break it down.

First, let's look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, this should become a secondary alcohol. But wait, the molecule is (S) configured. So the starting material is a chiral ketone.

When LAH is used to reduce a ketone, it typically gives a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the configuration after reduction—does LAH cause racemization? I think LAH is a strong reducing agent and it's a bulky hydride source. So when it reduces a ketone, the resulting alcohol might retain the configuration or maybe not. Wait, no, usually LAH is not known for causing racemization. Wait, no: when a ketone is reduced, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is a planar sp² hybridized carbon. So the attack can come from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, wait—wait, wait, wait. The starting material is a chiral ketone. So the starting molecule is (S)-configured at which carbon? Let me draw the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at position 3, so the structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so positions 1-6. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be heptan-3-one. Wait, hexan-3-one would have 6 carbons
