Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm supposed to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one's correct.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, particles in a 1D infinite potential well have quantized energy levels. The energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula for the energy is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? Oh wait, in the question, E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, the particles here are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers, including spin. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum numbers n, and spin.

Since we have four spin-1/2 particles, each can have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each energy level (each n), we can have two particles with the same n but different spins.

Now, the system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well, so the possible states are determined by the quantum number n and spin.

The problem is about finding the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. Wait, what defines the energy of the system as a whole? The energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each particle.

So, to find the ground state, we need to arrange the four particles in the lowest possible energy states, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think. Each energy level n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the lowest energy would have two particles in n=1, and two in n=2, since n=1 can't hold more than two.

Wait no, wait. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the energies would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the system's total energy is calculated.

Wait, no, each particle contributes its own energy. So each of the two in n=1 contributes E, so 2*E. The two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2*4E=8E. Total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, looking at the options. Option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. Option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. Option A is 30E, 39E, 50E. Option
