Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because each |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors for the basis states. So, let me write them out.

The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together, I get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. I think the qubit space is represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere. Oh wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. But wait, the density matrix is a more general representation, including mixed states. So how does that translate?

I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write the Pauli matrices. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, when I compute r·σ, it's rx σx + ry σy + rz σz. Then, I + r·σ would be [[1+rz, rx - i ry],[rx + i ry, 1 - rz]]. Dividing by 2 gives the density matrix.

Our ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's equate this to (I + r·σ)/2. So,

(1/2) I + (1/2)(r·σ) = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So in our case,

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 = [[1/2 (1 + rz), 1/2 (rx - i ry)], [1/2 (rx + i ry), 1/2 (1 - rz)]]

But our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1
