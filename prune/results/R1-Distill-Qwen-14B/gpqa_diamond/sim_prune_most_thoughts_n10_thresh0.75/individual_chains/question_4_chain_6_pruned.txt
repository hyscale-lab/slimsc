Alright, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a alternate universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.

In our real world, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. That's why when you break a magnet into pieces, each piece is still a magnet with both poles. This is due to the principle of magnetic duality or something like that. But in this question, they're saying in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, that must change some fundamental things about how we understand magnetism.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. Let me recall the four equations:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

So, in our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles), so the sources of B (like magnetic charges) don't exist. So ∇·B = 0.

But in this alternate universe, they can have isolated north or south poles. That implies that magnetic monopoles exist. So the equation for the divergence of B would change. Because if you have monopoles, then divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's law for E has the electric charge.

So, in this scenario, equation 2 would no longer be ∇·B = 0. Instead, it would be something like ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

Which Maxwell equations are affected because of this? Well, equation 2 is about the divergence of B. So that one changes.

Wait, but the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different in this universe. So the second equation is definitely different.

What about the others? Let me think. The other equations involve the curl of E and B. Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. In our universe, Faraday's Law says the curl of E is the negative rate of change of B. If there's a changing B, you get a circulating E field. But if there are magnetic monopoles, does that affect Faraday's Law?

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, there would also be a divergence for the electric field, or perhaps another term. Wait, let's think about the other equations.

In our current understanding, Gauss's law for magnetism is the one that's different. But what about the other equations? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law involve curls. I don't think the existence of magnetic monopoles affects Faraday's Law directly, unless we're considering a different formulation.

Wait, but the whole point is that Maxwell's equations are modified when magnetic monopoles exist. There's a symmetry between electric and magnetic fields when monopoles exist. So in that case, both the divergence of E and B would have sources. Because normally, only E has divergence (Gauss's law) because of electric charges, and B's divergence is zero because no magnetic charges. But with monopoles, B's divergence isn't zero anymore.

Wait, maybe both Gauss's laws are modified. Wait, no, Gauss's law for E is about electric charges (which exist as monopoles), and Gauss's law for B would be about magnetic charges. So in this universe, the second equation would change, but the first would remain the same.

But the question is about which equations are different. So equation 2 is different. Are there any others?

Wait, another thought: when magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So previously, only the divergence of B was zero, but if B has divergence, then maybe the curl of E would have an additional term, like the time derivative of some B-like term.

Wait, let me think about how Maxwell's equations change when magnetic monopoles exist. In our universe, there's a symmetry between E and B in the curl terms. For example, the curl of E is -dB/dt, and the curl of B is μ₀ J + something with dE/dt. If monopoles exist, then the divergence of B isn't zero. Also, perhaps the divergence of E would be something else? Or not?

Wait, no. Wait, Gauss's law for E is ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, which is because of electric charge. So if we have magnetic monopoles, does that change the other equations? Let's see.

In the standard equations, the divergence of E is due to electric charge, and the divergence of B is zero. But with monopoles, the divergence
