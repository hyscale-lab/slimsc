Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by the process γγ → e+ e−. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is pretty high energy.

I remember that when high-energy photons interact with the CMB, their mean free path is determined by the probability of such annihilations. If the photon's energy is high enough, the probability becomes significant enough that the photon can't travel too far without annihilating, which limits its lifetime.

So the process in question is pair production via CMB photons. I think the cross-section for this process increases as the photon energy increases. There's a threshold energy involved where the interaction becomes possible.

Wait, the energy required for creating an electron-positron pair from two photons. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But since we have two electrons (e+ and e-), maybe I should think about the combined energy.

Wait, no, the pair production happens when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron rest mass. So each photon needs to have enough energy. But wait, the CMB photons are low energy, so perhaps the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy to, when combined with a CMB photon, provide the necessary energy for pair production.

So the threshold condition is that the sum of the energies of the two photons must be at least 2*m_e*c². But since the CMB photon energy is much smaller than the gamma-ray's energy, the condition is approximated by the gamma-ray photon's energy being on the order of 2*m_e c², but adjusted for the CMB photon's contribution.

Wait, more accurately, the center-of-mass energy squared s must be greater than or equal to (2 m_e c²)^2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since one photon is high energy and the other is low (CMB), the directions are opposite. Wait, in the lab frame, the gamma is moving in, say, the +x direction, and the CMB photon is in the -x direction because of the cosmic expansion or something. So their momenta are opposite.

Wait, but for the threshold condition, the center of mass energy must reach at least 2m_e c². Let me think about the frame where their momenta are opposite. So, the energy in the center-of-mass frame comes from adding the energies and subtracting the dot product of their momenta, since their directions are opposite.

Wait, the energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, but since E is much larger for the gamma, E2 is small. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate the invariant s.

Alternatively, I recall that the threshold condition for γγ → e+e- occurs when the two photons have sufficient combined energy. So each photon must have at least the energy such that when their energies are added, it's equal to twice the electron rest mass energy.

Wait, but in the CMB frame, the CMB photon has energy ε ~ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma has energy E. For the process to happen, the sum of their energies in the center of mass frame should be at least 2 m_e c².

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the pair production threshold. The condition is E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c²)^2, but I'm not too sure. Another approach: The cross-section for γγ→e+e− peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around 2 m_e c². So when the combined energy is just enough.

But in this case, the photons are moving in opposite directions. So the invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since photons
