Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but for the s states (like l=0), the selection rules might be a bit different. Because s states have angular momentum zero, so when they transition, l has to change by ±1. So from l=0, it can only go to l=1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It decays to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. So that's a transition from n=3 to n=1, but wait, that's a two-step process because in each dipole transition, the energy change is only Δn=±1, right? Or can it change by more?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, dipole transitions have specific selection rules. Let me think. The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1. So from l=0 (s orbital), the electron can only go to l=1 (p orbital). Similarly, from l=1, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But in this case, the initial state is l=0, so the first transition must be to l=1. Then, how does it get to l=0 again? Oh, wait, but the final state is l=0. So perhaps the decay has two steps: 3s → 2p → 1s.

Wait, but the question says via two dipole transitions. So the process goes from 3s to something, then to 1s. So the first transition must be from 3s (n=3, l=0) to a state with l=1. So that would be 3s → 2p? Or 3s → 3p? Wait, no, n can change as long
