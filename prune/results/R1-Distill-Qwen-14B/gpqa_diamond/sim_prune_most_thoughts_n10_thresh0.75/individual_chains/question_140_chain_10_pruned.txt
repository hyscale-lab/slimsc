Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. 

Additionally, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with Substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Alright, let's start by figuring out what Substance X could be. I remember that in organic chemistry, common reagents include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, H2O2, etc. But considering the reaction with a liquid Y. Oh, wait, maybe X is something like H2O2 because it's a common oxidizing agent and reacts with other substances.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of X with Y produces a gas W. Gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about gases. Common gases are H2, O2, N2, CO2, NH3, etc. For a molecule where protons equal neutrons: Let's see, H2 has 1 proton and 1 neutron each, so total 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But wait, the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. For example, CO2: carbon has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (assuming the isotope is 12C, but wait, 12C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Oh, wait, 12 is 6+6. So CO2: each molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. But the question says the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me calculate:

Take H2O as another option. H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 8. So 10 vs 8, not equal. Not a match.

What about O2? Each O is 8p,8n. So per molecule, 16p and 16n. So yes, same number. So W could be O2?

Wait, but if X is H2O2, reacting with something else. Let me think: H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent. It can decompose when heated to produce O2. For example, H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. So in that case, gas W would be O2.

So, yes, if X is H2O2, it reacts with maybe an acid or a base. Wait, the problem says it reacts with liquid Y. So let's say it's a decomposition reaction. But H2O2 can also react with other substances. Alternatively, perhaps X is another peroxide.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Let me think about reactions that form precipitates. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt, and X is a reagent that causes precipitation. Alternatively, Y could be a base. Hmm.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think about substances that melt around that temperature. 277 K is about 4°C. What compounds have that melting point? Maybe something like water ice, but that's melting at 273 K (0°C). Wait, but 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, could B be some other substance, like maybe something that crystallizes at that temperature.

Wait, but B is a product when G is heated. So G is perhaps a hydrate that loses water of crystallization upon heating, releasing B. For example, if G is a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would remove water, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, if B is a metal, its melting point is around 277 K. Let me think of metals: Mercury has a melting point around 234 K, which is -40°C. So no. How about lead? It's higher. Maybe B is not a metal but a non-metal. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like NH3's melting point? No, ammonia is a gas at room temp. Wait, maybe B is a salt that crystallizes upon cooling. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, stepping back. Let's think about the product of a keto acid reacting with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid would react with an oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents include KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, and H2O2.

Wait, in the case of H2O2, when a keto acid like a ketone (like acetone) is oxidized, what happens? Typically, ketones are oxidized to carboxylic acids. Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe it's the dihydrogen monoxide (H2O) scenario, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle.

Substance X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and its analog is also used. H2O2 is commonly used as an oxidizing agent. Another possibility is ozone (O3), but that's a gas, so probably not.

Wait, the initial part of the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is H2O2, the heavier isotope could be deuterium (D2O2?), but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's something like H2O is H and O with a heavier isotope. Wait, but H2O2 is H-O-O-H. So maybe one of the oxygens is a heavier isotope, like O-18 instead of O-16.

Hmm, maybe X is not H2O2. Another oxidizing agent could be KMnO4. But KMnO4 is a solid, not a liquid. So Y is a liquid, so perhaps Y is an acid or another liquid.

Wait, the reaction is violent. Maybe a decomposition reaction? Or a reaction with a strong acid causing it to decompose?

Let me try to think of the gas W again. If W is O2, then perhaps X is H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2. So the reaction is 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. In that case, the precipitate G might be H2O, but H2O is a liquid, not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is another component that when mixed with X, causes a precipitate.

Another angle: the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B. So perhaps G is some kind of carbonate or hydroxide that upon heating loses CO2 or H2O, leaving behind a metal oxide.

Wait, but if X is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe it's reacting with Y, which is a metal sulfide or something. For example, KMnO4 reacting with a metal sulfide could produce a precipitate.

Wait, maybe I should think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the melting point of ice. What substance melts at that temperature? Maybe something like a hydrate? For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 277 K, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: if B is a solid that forms when G is heated, maybe G is a hydrate. For instance, copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·
