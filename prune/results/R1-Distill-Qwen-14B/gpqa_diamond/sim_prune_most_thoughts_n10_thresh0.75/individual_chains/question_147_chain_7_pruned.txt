Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait, let me think about the setup. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is low. But I'm not sure yet. Oh, wait, in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. So I'll probably need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me consider the initial and final states. Initially, there's a proton and an antiproton. The proton is at rest, I think, because it's not mentioned, but wait, no—the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving.

So, initial setup: proton (p) is at rest, and the antiproton (p̄) is moving with some velocity. So the initial total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (rest plus kinetic). But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. But I don't know if that's helpful yet.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So it has low kinetic energy, meaning its velocity is much less than the speed of light. So I might be able to approximate using non-relativistic mechanics for the antiproton. But wait, the final particles A could be moving at relativistic speeds, so I can't ignore relativity there.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of the A particles. So perhaps I should calculate their velocity based on conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial energy and momentum.
2. Set up the equations for the final energy and momentum, considering the products.
3. Use conservation laws to solve for the velocity of A.

But wait, the initial momentum comes from the antiproton
