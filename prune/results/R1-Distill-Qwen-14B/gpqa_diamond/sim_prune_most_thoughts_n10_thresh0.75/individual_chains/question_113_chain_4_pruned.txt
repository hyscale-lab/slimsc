Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The problem describes an unknown compound that's been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine its chemical formula from the data given, choosing between four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's broad and around 3000, it's more likely an -OH group. Because if it were a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually even broader and maybe a bit lower, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide. Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide.

Wait, but 1700 is a strong peak. So maybe it's an ester or ketone. But then another peak at 1650. What does that indicate? Could it be conjugated carbonyls, like in a conjugated system, or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents? Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring (like benzene) with substituents causing a peak around 1650. Wait, benzene's C=C peaks are usually around 1600 or so, but substituents can shift that. Or perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group â€” like a conjugated system between a carbonyl and a double bond. That would cause a peak around 1650 maybe.

So combining the IR data: broad peak at 3000 (probably -OH),
