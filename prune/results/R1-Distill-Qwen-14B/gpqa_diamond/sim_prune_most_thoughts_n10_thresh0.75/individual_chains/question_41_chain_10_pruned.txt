Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a light beam going through glass that's moving. The glass has a refractive index n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. And the question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect things?

Oh, right, this must involve some sort of relativity or relative velocity. Because the glass is moving, the frame of reference is different. So maybe I should think about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Or wait, is this a non-relativistic scenario? The problem says v is constant, but doesn't specify. Hmm, but since n is involved, maybe it's using the refractive index approach.

Wait, let me think. The speed of light in the medium is always c/n, regardless of the medium's motion, right? Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Oh wait, no, that's only in a vacuum. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium can be slower, but the refractive index is a material property
