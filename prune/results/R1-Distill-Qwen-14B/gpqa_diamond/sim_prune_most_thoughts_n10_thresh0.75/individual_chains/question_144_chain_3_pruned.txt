Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. They've given me some parameters: production energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons, which are bosons, can decay, and their mean decay length depends on their lifetime and their velocity. So, the mean decay distance (L) should be the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (βc), right? Or wait, maybe just β times c times τ. Let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is L = β c τ. Because velocity is βc, so when you multiply by time, you get distance.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is around ħ. So Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let's be precise. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is approximately the inverse of the lifetime, but considering the natural units. So, τ is roughly ħ divided by Γ. But I should check the exact relation.

Wait, actually, the width Γ is the total decay rate, which is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. I think that's correct. So I can compute τ using that formula.

But wait, I also need to find the velocity β. How do I get that? Oh, from the energy and mass. Because the total energy E is given. For a relativistic particle, the energy is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²). From that, we can find γ, then β.

Wait, let's make sure about the units. The given E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so E and m are in GeV. But c is in m/s, but perhaps we can work in natural units
