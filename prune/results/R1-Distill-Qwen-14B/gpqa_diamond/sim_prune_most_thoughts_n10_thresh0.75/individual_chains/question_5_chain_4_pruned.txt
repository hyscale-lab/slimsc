Alright, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Okay, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin angular momentum can be represented using Pauli matrices or similar 2x2 matrices.

First, let me parse the given information. The operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

So, given that the direction is in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the operator P along n, which I'll denote as P_n, should be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Wait, no, the operator along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction unit vector. So P_n = P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but in this case, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. So P_n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue of P_n is ħ/2, the eigenvector must be an eigenstate of P_n with that eigenvalue.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, putting it together, P_n is (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. Multiplying each term:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now, we're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [v1; v2] = (ħ/2) [v1; v2]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * v1 + sinθ * v2 = v1 ]
[ sinθ * v1 - cosθ * v2 = v2 ]

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: cosθ * v1 + sinθ * v2 = v1
Equation 2: sinθ * v1 - cosθ * v2 = v2

Let me rearrange Equation 1:
cosθ * v1 + sinθ * v2 - v1 = 0
v1 (cosθ - 1) + v2 sinθ = 0.

Equation 2:
sinθ * v1 - cosθ * v2 - v2 = 0
v1 sinθ - v2 (cosθ + 1) = 0.

So we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
2) sinθ v1 - (cosθ + 1) v2 = 0

We can solve this system for v1 and v2. Let's treat these as two equations in variables v1 and v2. Let me write the equations as:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ      ] [v1]   = [0]
[   sinθ     -(cosθ +1) ] [v2]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. Let me compute the determinant.

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(- (cosθ +1)) ) - (sinθ)(sinθ)
= -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) - sin²θ
= -(cos²θ -1) - sin²θ [since (a-b)(a+b)=a² -b²]
= -(cos²θ -1) - sin²θ
= (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ
But 1 = sin²θ + cos²θ, so:
= [ sin²θ + cos²θ - cos²θ ] - sin²θ
= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So determinant is zero, so there's a non-trivial solution.

Let me pick one equation to solve. Let's take equation 1:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
Solving for v2:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Alternatively, equation 2:

sinθ v1 = (cosθ +1) v2
v2 = [ sinθ / (cosθ +1) ] v1

Wait, let me check both equations. Are these expressions equivalent?

Let me compute (1 - cosθ)/sinθ and sinθ/(1+cosθ).

We know that (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = (2 sin²(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) = tan(theta/2)

Similarly, sinθ/(1+cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] ) = tan(theta/2).

So both expressions for v2 in terms of v1 are equal. So we can express v2 as tan(theta/2) * v1.

So let's let v1 = a, then v2 = a tan(theta/2).

The eigenvector is then proportional to [1; tan(theta/2)].

Wait, let me write it as [1; tan(theta/2)] or [a; a tan(theta/2)].

But we need to normalize the eigenvector. So the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)]^T. Wait, but wait, the actual components are v1 and v2, so the vector is [v1, v2] = [a, a tan(theta/2)].

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

Compute |a|^2 [1 + tan^2(theta/2)] = 1.

1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2) = 1 / cos^2(theta/2).

So |a|^2 * (1 / cos²(theta/2)) ) = 1 → |a|^2 = cos²(theta/2).

So a = cos(theta/2), since we can take positive real for simplicity. Alternatively, a could be a complex number, but in this case, perhaps the eigenvectors are real since the matrix is Hermitian.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the matrix P_n. Since P is an angular momentum operator, it should be Hermitian, so its eigenvectors should be real.

So, the normalized eigenvector would be:

v1 = cos(theta/2) * e^{i phi} ?

Wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. Because when the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle phi is zero. So the state doesn't have any phase factor in the y direction. So phi is zero, and the eigenvector is real.

Wait, but the given options have some with exponential terms, like option B and others. Hmm, but in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1.

So the components are:

v1 = cos(theta/2)
v2 = sin(theta/2)

Wait, let me check:

Because earlier, we had v2 = a tan(theta/2), and a = cos(theta/2). So v2 = cos(theta/2) * tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So [v1, v2] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, let's verify:

If [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is the vector, then the normalization is cos^2 + sin^2 = 1, which holds.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But let me look at the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is
