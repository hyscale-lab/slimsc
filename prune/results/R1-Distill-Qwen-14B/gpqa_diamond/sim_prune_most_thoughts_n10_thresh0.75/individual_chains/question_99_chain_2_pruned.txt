Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of the unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by going through the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. That's a region where O-H or N-H stretching typically occurs. But given the options, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because all the options end with COOH. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding. So that makes sense.

Next, the FTIR also shows a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That area is usually indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). Since the compound has a COOH group, that 1700 peak likely corresponds to the carbonyl stretch of the carboxylic acid. The exact position can vary, but 1700 is in the right ballpark for a carboxylic acid.

Now moving on to the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense since all the options are branched alkanes with a COOH group. So, no alkenes, so no vinyl Hs.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each split indicates coupling with neighboring protons. The more splits, the more neighboring groups with which the proton is coupling.

So first, the doublet of triplets of quartets. Breaking it down: a doublet means splitting into two peaks, which comes from coupling with one neighbor. Then, each of those splits into triplets, so each of the two peaks is further split by two neighboring environments (maybe two sets of protons). Then each triplet splits into quartets, which is four peaks—so another neighboring group that's coupling with three equivalent protons (quartet arises from coupling with 3 Hs).

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me try to determine how many neighboring groups it's coupling with. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where each coupling leads to a splitting into n+1 peaks, where n is the number of neighboring protons.

Let me think of this as a series of couplings. So, starting with a quartet: that's a splitting into four peaks, which would mean coupling with a group of three equivalent protons. Then, each of those splits into a triplet, meaning each peak is coupling with two protons. And then each of those splits into a doublet, which is coupling with one proton.

Wait, wait. Let me reverse. The initial splitting is a quartet. That means the proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons. Then, each line of the quartet is split into a triplet—so each of those is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Then each of the triplet lines is split into a doublet, which would be adjacent to one proton.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. The order of splits matters because each split is due to a different set of neighboring protons. So, first, the quartet: coupled to 3 H's. Then, each of those splits into a triplet (coupled to 2 H's). Then each of those splits into a doublet (coupled to 1 H). So the overall splitting would be a (3+1) × (2+1) × (1+1) = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24 lines? That seems complicated, but maybe in reality, some of the couplings are with equivalent protons, so it's not that bad.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to vicinal (adjacent) coupling in a chain. Let's think about the structure. The options are all substituted pentanoic acids? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2(C2H5)... Wait, no, perhaps it's more like:

Looking at each option:

Option A: CH3-C(H)-(C2H5) - C(H)-(C2H5) - CH2-COOH.

So the backbone is CH2CH2CH2... Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2... No, let me write it as:

The structure is CH3-C(H)(CH2CH3) - C(H)(CH2CH3) - CH2-COOH. So the central two CH groups are each attached to ethyl groups.

Wait
