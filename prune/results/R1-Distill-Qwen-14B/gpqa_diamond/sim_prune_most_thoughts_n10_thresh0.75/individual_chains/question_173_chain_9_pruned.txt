Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved when we're dealing with the uncertainty in an electron's position and momentum. 

The problem states that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. They're asking for the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are from 10^-18 J up to 10^-16 J. 

Hmm, I think I need to use the Uncertainty Principle here. The principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So mathematically, Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). 

Wait, but since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I guess I should take the equality: Δx * Δp = h/(4π). From that, I can solve for Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. 

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty, ΔE. How does momentum relate to energy? Oh right, the kinetic energy is p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. 

But wait a second, isn't energy related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula? So if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be (Δp)^2/(2m). But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in momentum. Since energy is a function of momentum, the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of energy with respect to momentum multiplied by Δp. 

Wait, let me think. The energy E for a non-relativistic particle is E = (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in E, ΔE, can be found by taking the derivative of E with respect to p, which is dE/dp = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But wait, since p is an average value here, perhaps we can approximate it as p ≈ mv, given that the electron's speed is v. 

Wait, but
