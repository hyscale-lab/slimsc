Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is, given some IR and NMR data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I should look at the spectral data to determine what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can figure out what reaction it undergoes when treated with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or maybe N-H stretching. But more likely, it's an -OH group because amine N-H tends to be around 3300-3500, but maybe a broad range. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data next. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. A proton that's exchanging? Maybe an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have protons that are usually around 10-12 ppm, and they can be broad due to hydrogen bonding.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring. If the substituents are on the para position, the aromatic protons would couple with each other. Like in a para-substituted benzene, each pair of protons would be a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, another doublet. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each having two protons as doublets. Wait, no, two doublets with 2H each would mean four protons on the ring. So maybe the ring is 1,4-disubstituted.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet. This could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a carbonyl group. Maybe a CH near a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester, or perhaps an -OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe a CH group in a secondary alcohol or something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, two protons. This might be a CH2 group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl or an oxygen. Or maybe part of a larger chain, like a CH2 between two substituents.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of three protons. This is likely a CH3 group attached to a CH that's next to another group, perhaps a carbonyl. For example, in an acetylation, like CH3-C(O)-R, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling with a neighboring CH. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group, like an isopropyl or similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet of three protons. That's a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think: the aromatic protons are two doublets each with 2H. So maybe the ring is 1,4-disubstituted, and each substituent is on the para positions. Let's imagine substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Looking at the substituents:

One substituent may be an ethyl group. Because the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH3 at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group attached to the ring. But wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 in the ethyl chain. Let's think: the triplet (0.9) is the CH3 of an ethyl group, and the CH2 would be at around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet because it's next to another CH2 or something else. Wait, but in an ethyl group, the CH2 would usually be around 1.3-1.5 ppm as a quartet. Hmm, maybe it's not an ethyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a longer chain.

Wait, let me think. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. So, maybe a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. For example, maybe a CH(CH3) group. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH(CH3)CH2- something. Or maybe a CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's think about a ketone. If there's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the adjacent CH would have a peak around 2.5-3 ppm. So, perhaps a structure like CH3-C(O)-CH2-Ar, where Ar is the aromatic ring. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks for the carbonyl oxygen, but the IR does show a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes typically show peaks around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but in the NMR, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which might be more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which fits the 3400–2500 cm-1 range. The 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl, which in a carboxylic acid would be around 1700 cm-1, but maybe a bit higher if it's an ester or ketone. Wait, but wait: carboxylic acids typically have broad O-H stretches in the IR, and their carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. So the 1720 might be more like an ester or maybe a ketone.

Hmm, alternative approach. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aromatic ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted. Let's say substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 4. Each substituent may have certain groups.

Looking at the substituents:

- The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. So maybe substituent B is an ethyl group attached to the ring, like -CH2CH3.

Wait, but then the peak at 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be the CH2 next to the ring. So substituent B could be a propyl group? Or maybe it's part of a larger substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another group. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be the CH next to the carbonyl, like in a ketone. So perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group, like -CO-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe it's a propanoyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3. No, let me think again. Let's consider the substituent being a carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzoyl group with a substituent. Let me think of the structure as, maybe, benzophenone derivative. No, but let's look at the NMR.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. If it's a ketone, the NMR would show the adjacent CH. So in a structure like Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH(CH3)2. But I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should list the possible substituents.

Looking at the NMR again:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably an -OH, maybe a carboxylic acid, so maybe the substituent is a COOH group. Or, alternatively, an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but the IR would show a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 for aldehyde C-H stretch. The given IR has 3400–2500, which is a broader range, more like an O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if that's the case, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a COOH group. But let's see the other substituents.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each as doublets. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, each with two protons.

Wait, if the ring is 1,4-disubstituted and each substituent is a group that leaves two protons as doublets, that would make sense. For example, if one substituent is a COOH group in position 1 and another substituent in position 4.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents in 1 and 4 positions. If substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B in position 4.

Substituent A: Let's say COOH. Then, substituent B would have to account for the rest of the NMR signals.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH3 connected to a CH which is connected to something else. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is another CH, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe substituent B is a group like CH(CH3)COOH? No, not quite.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a propyl group or something with branching.

Wait, let me consider the possible substituents:

The substituent in position 4 could be something like CH2CH2CH3 (but that's an ethyl group). Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a CH3 connected to a CH2. So perhaps substituent B is a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the ring.

Wait, but if substituent B is an ethyl group (CH2CH3), then the aromatic protons would be in the positions ortho and para to the substituent. Wait, but that would make the ring have substituents at 1 and 4, so the substituents would be para to each other.

So substituent A is at 1, maybe a carbonyl group, and substituent B at 4, maybe an ethyl group.

Wait, but substituent A being a carbonyl group would make the ring para-substituted with a carbonyl. Alternatively, substituent A could be a COOH group.

Wait, but if substituent A is a COOH group, then the ring would have a COOH at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4. Then, looking at the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm would be the COOH proton, the aromatic protons would be in the regions given. The substituent at 4 is an ethyl group, so the CH2CH3 would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), and the CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

But wait, the 1.7 ppm is m (2H). So perhaps a CH2 group attached to the ring. Then the substituent is -CH2- something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, maybe it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a CH2CH2 group attached to something else. Hmm, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think of the structure as something like 4-(something)benzoic acid. So maybe substituent at position 4 is a chain, and position 1 is a COOH group.

But then, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as doublets. Let me think about the benzene ring. If the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (CH2CH2CH3), then the ring would have H in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents at 1 and 4 would cause the adjacent protons (ortho and para) to split into specific patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but in such a way that each has two adjacent protons as doublets.

Wait, but maybe the structure is more like a propyl group attached to the ring. Let me try to imagine substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, another approach. The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone. But then, the NMR would have a CH next to the carbonyl.

Wait, the substituent could be a group like CH2-CO-R. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another group.

So, substituent B is perhaps a CH(CH3)2 group. But where?

Wait, maybe substituent B is a CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2CH2CH3. Then, the NMR would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (CH2), and a triplet around 2.9 ppm (CH2). But the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. No, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH(CH3)2 group. Then, the carbonyl would be at 1720 cm-1, and the adjacent CH would have a peak around 2.9 ppm. Let me check:

The substituent would be -COCH(CH3)2. The CH(CH3)2 would have a CH peak around 2.9 ppm (since it's next to the carbonyl), which fits the NMR. The CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at around 1.4 ppm as a doublet (since each CH3 is attached to the CH, and the splitting comes from coupling with the CH). But wait, the 1.4 ppm has 3H as a doublet, which would suggest a single CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps substituent B is a CH(CH3) group attached to the ring via a carbonyl.

So, the structure would be:

Phenyl group with substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Substituent at 1: COOH (since the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, possibly a carboxylic acid).

Substituent at 4: CO-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, if substituent at 4 is a CH(CH3) group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, such as Ar-CO-CH(CH3)2. But then, the CH(CH3)2 group would have a peak for the CH at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H each). So each CH3 would split the signal, but in this case, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH that's split by another group. So, that fits.

So putting it all together, the structure is benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and a COCH(CH3)2 group at position 4. Wait, but that would make it a 4-substituted benzoyl group. Hmm, maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

Let me think about the reaction part. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hiyama reaction, but more commonly, they're used to reduce certain groups, like in the case of the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but red phosphorus and HI might be for a different reduction.

Wait, another reaction: the reduction of esters. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. Wait, but typically, to reduce a ketone to an alcohol, you might use something like NaBH4, but red phosphorus and HI could be involved in a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reduction of nitriles to amines, but that's with different reagents. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is of an ester to an alcohol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's the reduction of a nitrile group to an amine, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl group and treat with red phosphorus and HI, that's the Clemmensen-like reduction. Clemmensen typically reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, no, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes (like R2C=O becomes R2CH2), but I think in some cases, it can reduce esters as well.

Wait, but wait, the classic Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but other methods with red phosphorus and HI might do similar things. So, if Compound X has a carbonyl group, say a ketone, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a methylene group (CH2).

Wait, but let me make sure. The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes by removing the oxygen. So, R-CO-R' becomes R-CH2-R'. So, in our case, if Compound X is a ketone, the reaction would convert it into an alkane.

But looking at the options, the possible products are benzoic acid derivatives, but some are alkanes.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, a propanoic acid attached to ethylphenyl.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's cumene, perhaps.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what the starting material is. Let's say the starting material is a ketone attached to an aromatic ring. When reduced, it would become a methylene group.

Alternatively, if the starting material is an aldehyde, it would be reduced to a primary alcohol. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction. Wait, but carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions, as they're quite stable. So maybe the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be an ester carbonyl. Because esters have carbonyl around 1720-1750 cm-1. If it's an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might be saponification, but that usually requires a base. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution or elimination. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out the structure of Compound X first.

So, going back to the NMR:

The broad peak at 10.5 ppm is likely a carboxylic acid proton. So, substituent A is a COOH group. Substituent B is a group that gives the other NMR signals.

The aromatic protons are two doublets (each 2H). So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted, with substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (another group). The substituent at 4 must account for the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) signals.

So substituent B is probably a chain that has a CH connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH3 group and a longer chain.

Let me try to build substituent B:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain, connected via a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to something. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group, perhaps connected to a carbonyl.

So the substituent could be a propyl group attached to a CH that's linked to another group. Wait, perhaps it's a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me see:

The substituent would be -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but that would give:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

- The CH2 next to it (the middle CH2) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But then, where is the carbonyl group? Oh, wait. The substituent could be a -CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group? Or perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a peak around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2 next to it (the one closer to the ring) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The terminal CH3 from the ethyl group would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).
- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent B would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring.

So the structure would be 4-(2-ethylpropyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but let's check:

Wait, the substituent is at position 4. It's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. So the structure is:

Phenyl group with COOH at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, but let me count the carbons:

- The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So from the ring, it's CH2 connected to CH, which is connected to CH2CH3.

So the substituent is a pentyl group? No, wait, it's a -CH2-CH(Et)- group. So it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a 3-methylbutyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, no, let me think again. The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which can be written as -CH2CH(CH2CH3). So it's a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to an ethyl group.

Wait, that would make substituent B a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the chain is:

Ring - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Thus, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, but that would make substituent B a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a 3-methylpentyl group? No, maybe it's a 4-ethylbutyl group or something.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to a ring. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3)2 would have a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH3 groups on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H each, but in the NMR, it's 3H as a doublet).
Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a single CH3 attached to a CH, which is then connected to another group.

So substituent B would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's a propyl group. Wait, but the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests a CH3 connected to a CH2. So substituent B could be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a 3-ethylpropyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group with a branch. Let me think about how this would look in the NMR.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a 3-ethylpropyl group.

So, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 next to the ring would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH attached to CH2CH3 would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2CH3 group would have the CH2 at around 1.7 ppm (but that's already accounted for), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would give:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The next CH2 would be perhaps around 1.4 ppm, but that's not matching the NMR.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should consider the structure differently.

Let me try to draw it out mentally. The ring has a COOH group at position 1. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a chain.

The substituent's NMR data:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 at the end of a chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2 next to something.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 attached to a CH.

So, the substituent could be a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that's a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of the substituent being a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would be:

Ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, but that would be a 3-methylbutyl group.

Wait, let's count:

- The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, from the ring: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group, which is also known as a neopentyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

In this case, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group:

The structure would be:

Ph-COOH (position 1) and Ph-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (position 4).

But wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would be the terminal CH3. The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which could be a CH2 adjacent to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So, from the ring:

Ring - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3).

In this case, the substituent is a 3-ethylpropyl group.

The NMR would then show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2 next to the ring would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH2CH3 group would have the CH2 at around 1.7 ppm (but that's already accounted for?), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).
- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would correspond to the CH3 attached to the CH in the substituent.

Wait, in this case, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH3 group attached to it, which would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

Ah, that makes sense. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, substituent B is a 3-ethylpropyl group.

Therefore, the structure of Compound X is 4-(3-ethylpropyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me write that correctly. The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring. So, it's a 3-ethylpropyl group, which is also known as a pentyl group with a branch.

But wait, 3-ethylpropyl is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-?

No, wait, propyl is three carbons, but adding ethyl would make it longer. Maybe it's a butyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Then, it's a 3-ethylbutyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. Then, the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group.

Wait, but let's think again about the NMR:

- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to something else.

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH adjacent to the carbonyl (if it's a ketone) or adjacent to the ring.

Wait, if Compound X is a benzoyl derivative with a substituent that includes a CH(CH3) group, then perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring.

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, making it a 3-methylbutyl group.

Thus, the substituent would be:

Ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - ?

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring.

So, in the substituent, the -CH(CH3) is connected to the ring via a CH2 group. So, substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's only two carbons beyond the ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would require the substituent to be longer.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this, so perhaps I should proceed to the reaction part.

Assuming that Compound X has a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1), and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reduction.

If the carbonyl is a ketone, then the reduction would convert it into a methylene group.

So, if Compound X is a ketone attached to an aromatic ring, the reaction would produce a CH2 group in place of the CO.

Wait, but let's imagine that the substituent at position 4 is a -CO-R group, and upon reduction, it becomes -CH2-R.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a -COOR (ester), the reduction would produce -CH2OR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, upon reduction, it would become -CH2CH(CH3)2.

But let's think about that. The substituent in Compound X is a -COCH(CH3)2 group. So, when reduced, it becomes -CH2CH(CH3)2.

But then, the product would be 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

If substituent B is a -COCH(CH3)2 group in Compound X, then when reduced, it becomes -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me check:

If Compound X is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid (or 4-isopropylbenzoic acid), but wait, no, because in that case, the substituent would be a -COCH(CH3)2 group, which upon reduction becomes -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the substituent structure. If substituent B in Compound X is a propionyl group (COCH2CH2CH3), then upon reduction, it would become CH2CH2CH3, but that's a propyl group, not a sec-butyl.

But in our earlier analysis, substituent B has a branch, as indicated by the NMR signals.

In the NMR of Compound X, substituent B has a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 and a terminal CH3. So substituent B is a -COCH(CH3)2 group in Compound X.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -COCH(CH3)2 group. Then, upon reduction, it becomes -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Let me check the options again. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that should be the correct answer.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, possibly a ketone or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
From the spectral data, Compound X is deduced to be **4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid** (a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a -COCH(CH₃)₂ group at position 4). The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl group in the ketone, and the NMR data matches the expected signals for this structure.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones) to methylene groups (-CH₂). In this case, the ketone group (-COCH(CH₃)₂) in Compound X is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂), forming a **sec-butyl group**. The carboxylic acid group remains unaffected during the reaction.

### Final Product:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
