Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies. But how does the enthalpy of atomization factor into this?

So, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon like this, it's formed from carbon and hydrogen.

The formula I remember is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products). Wait no, wait, no—actually, wait, the correct formula is the other way around. Oh right, because when bonds form, energy is released, but when bonds break, energy is absorbed. So the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds.

Wait no, maybe I got it reversed. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The standard approach is: Enthalpy of formation is the heat change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So for that, you calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and subtract the energy released when bonds form in the product.

Wait, another way to think about it: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: ΔHf° = [Σ (H of bonds in elements) ] - [Σ (H of bonds in compound) ]

But wait, the elements are in their standard states. So for carbon and hydrogen, what are their standard states? Carbon is graphite, I think, and hydrogen is H2 gas. So the bond energies would be the energy required to break the bonds in those elements.

Wait, the question provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, that's the energy needed to break all bonds in carbon to make it into atoms. So for graphite, which is the standard state of carbon, the
