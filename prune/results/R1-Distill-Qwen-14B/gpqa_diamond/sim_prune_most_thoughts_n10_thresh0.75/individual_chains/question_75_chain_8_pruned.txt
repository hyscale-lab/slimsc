Okay, so I've got this question here about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein. The researcher is trying to overexpress this protein using a plasmid, but it's not working. They've introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus, and they're using Lipofectamine to transfect it into Chinese hamster ovary cells. But the overexpression isn't happening as expected.

The question is why. The given options are A to D. Let me think about each possible issue.

First, looking at the construct's DNA sequence. The sequence provided is the plus strand, so that's the sense strand. Let me see if there are any obvious issues here. The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes some nucleotides. Let's see, I can scan through the coding sequence.

Wait, the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence should be before the GADD45G coding sequence. But looking at the sequence, the first part is ATG, which is methionine, the start. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, wait, HA is a specific peptide usually from the influenza virus. The HA tag is a small peptide sequence, like YPYDVPDYA or something similar. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence before the GADD45G starts.

Looking at the given construct, the sequence starts with ATG TAC... So the first codon is methionine, the next is tyrosine. If the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, that means the HA coding should be before the ATG start of GADD45G. Wait, but in the given sequence, the ATG is the start, so maybe the HA isn't present? Or perhaps it's part of the ATG? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the HA is a separate peptide.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is added at the beginning, so the construct's coding sequence should be: HA coding sequence followed by ATG and then GADD45G. But looking at this plasmid's coding sequence, the first thing is ATG, which is the start codon. So the HA tag is not present? That can't be right because the question says they introduced the HA sequence. Or am I misunderstanding the setup?

Wait, no, the question says: "modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein." So the HA should be before the start of GADD45G.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon of GADD45G. So the HA tag must be included in the sequence before the ATG. Wait, perhaps I can check the sequence.

Looking at the first part: 5' ATG TAC ... So the first codon is ATG (start), second is TAC (tyrosine), third is CAT (His?), etc. But wait, perhaps the HA tag coding is before the ATG? Let me think. If the HA is added at the N-terminus, the coding sequence would have the HA's DNA sequence, then a start codon, then the GADD45G sequence.

So the construct's coding sequence should be HA-tag DNA followed by ATG and GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the first thing is ATG, so the HA tag's coding sequence is missing. Alternatively, maybe the HA is part of the start sequence. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is being added via a linker or a fusion. So in the construct, the HA should be at the N-terminus, meaning before the ATG of GADD45G. But the given sequence starts with ATG,
