Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of reactions in the Sun's core stops. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, wait, the Sun is about 8 light minutes away from Earth, so that makes sense. So, the neutrinos from the Sun would take 8.5 minutes to reach us. So any changes in the Sun's core would be noticeable to us after that time.

The pp-III branchâ€”what's that? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing boron-8, which then goes into the CNO cycle or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions where two protons combine with a boron-8 nucleus to produce lithium-7 and then eventually helium-4.

Neutrinos are produced in several processes in the Sun. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the dominant pp chain, but also the CNO cycle produces some. The pp-III branch is probably a minor contributor, but if it stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop.

The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2).

Wait, I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have lower energies compared to those from the CNO cycle. Let me think. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, while the pp chain produces lower-energy ones. The pep reaction is part of the pp chain and emits lower-energy neutrinos, like around 1-2 MeV, but wait, no, maybe it's higher. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, actually, the dominant neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the pp chain, which are lower energy, around a few hundred keV. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, like up to a few MeV. So the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a certain energy range, and if it stops, that part of the flux would drop.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that process would no longer be emitted. So for the neutrino fluxes, the energies affected would be those produced by the pp-III reactions.

So what energies are we talking about here? The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a certain range. Let me think about the typical energies. The main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) produces neutrinos via the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus captures an electron proton, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is about 0.385 MeV, which is 385 keV. Wait, no, no, wait. Boron-8 has a mass, and when it captures a proton, it emits a neutrino. The neutrino energy is about 0.385 MeV, so 385 keV. But wait, that's the main neutrino from the pp chain.

Wait, but the CNO cycle emits higher energy neutrinos. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch might be in the same lower energy range as the main pp chain. Or wait, maybe the pp-III is a side reaction that produces a different kind of neutrino. Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino emission from the pp chain (the Beryllium-7 + proton reaction) gives off about 0.385 MeV, which is around 385 keV. So that neutrino is in the 300-400 keV range.

The question is about bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So higher than the main pp neutrinos. So these higher energy bands are probably dominated by the CNO cycle.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, what's the effect on the neutrino flux? The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, so if it stops, the production of some of the neutrinos from that branch would stop. But I thought the majority of solar neutrinos come from the main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) and the CNO cycle.

Wait, perhaps I should look at what each neutrino source contributes. The main neutrino source is the pp chain, which produces the 385 keV neutrinos. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, up to maybe a few MeV. The pep reaction, a part of the pp chain, produces about 1.4 MeV neutrinos, but that's a small
