Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, I need to figure out what the NMR signals indicate about the structures. Let me start with the aromatic region. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound contributes a singlet. In aromatic NMR, singlets usually mean that the protons are equivalent and have no neighboring protons. So, each compound must have aromatic protons that are all equivalent and not splitting into multiple peaks.

Wait, but wait. If the two compounds each give a singlet, that would mean each has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps each has multiple equivalent protons but each set is a singlet. Hmm. Let me think. For example, if a benzene ring has all six positions substituted such that only one set of equivalent protons remains. Or maybe it has two sets but in a way that each set integrates as a singlet.

Wait, but each compound contributes a singlet at the same region. So each has only one type of aromatic proton. Because the question says two signals (singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. So each at 6.7 ppm, but their integration is 1:1. So each compound contributes a singlet.

So each compound must have a single set of equivalent aromatic protons. That suggests that each aromatic ring is highly substituted, perhaps with symmetry leading to equivalent protons.

Let me think about the tetramethylbenzenes. The molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, because each compound is C10H14. Let's see, benzene has 6 C, so the substituents must add up to 4 C, but wait, each substituent may have more. Wait,
