Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying the product of a specific bicyclic compound undergoing Cope rearrangement.

First, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene. The structure has to be a 1,5-diene, right? So the starting material should have two double bonds separated by three single bonds, making a conjugated diene.

Looking at the compound given: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, okay. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the compound is a bicyclic system with a bridge. The substituents are a vinyl group (which is a CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-) attached at position 2, and there's an azabicyclo part, which means there's a nitrogen in the ring, probably part of the bridge.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo part is heptane, with two bridges of two carbons and one bridge of one carbon. The 2-azabicyclo suggests that the nitrogen is at position 2. So the structure has a bridge where one of the bridgeheads is nitrogen.

So the molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, meaning there's a double bond at position 5. The 2-vinyl is a substituent; that is, a vinyl group attached to the second carbon, which is also where the nitrogen is located. So the structure is a norbornene with a vinyl group attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen.

Wait, but norbornene has a double bond in the bridge. Let me imagine norbornene: it's bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. But in this case, the double bond is at position 5. So, the structure would have the double bond between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

The bicyclo structure: imagine three bridges. The main bridge is from C1 to C4, which is a two-carbon bridge. Then another bridge from C4 to C5 is a two-carbon bridge, and another from C5 to C1 is a one-carbon bridge, but wait no, I might be getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have a bridge structure where the bridge lengths are 2, 2, and 1. So, the three bridges are: between C1 and C4 (two carbons), C4 and C5 (two carbons), and C5 and C1 (one carbon). So the structure would have a double bond at position 5, which is part of one of the bridges.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the norbornene structure. The parent structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bond is between C5 and C6? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has the double bond between C5 and C6, but I'm not entirely certain.

But regardless, the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene. So, the molecule must have two double bonds with three single bonds in between. Wait, no, the Cope rearrangement is specifically for 1,5-dienes. So the molecule needs to have a conjugated diene that's in a 1,5 arrangement. So, let me see: the starting molecule must have a 1,5-diene system. But wait, the given molecule is a bicyclo compound with a vinyl group. Let me think about the structure.

The compound is 2
