Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

We have an atom that has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, wait. I think radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? So the probability isn't just a simple percentage that adds up over time. Or does it? Wait, no, it's more about the half-life and the decay constant.

Wait, the given probability is 32% over 100 minutes. So the probability that the atom decays in time t is given by 1 minus the exponential function. Let me recall the formula. The probability P that a nucleus decays by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, the question says the probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that would mean P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). I can solve for λ from this equation.

Let me rearrange that. e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -λ * 100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5. Let me approximate it. Maybe around -0.4? Wait, wait, better to calculate it exactly. Wait, I can't compute it exactly right now, but perhaps I can proceed symbolically first.

Wait, the question is after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. So the next 150 minutes from now, or the next 150 including the 50?

Wait, the question says, "What is the probability it will
