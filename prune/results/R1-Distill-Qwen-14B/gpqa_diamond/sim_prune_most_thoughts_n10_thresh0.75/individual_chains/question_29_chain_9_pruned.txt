Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some mutants. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about eliminating an anti-nutritional compound in a drought-resistant barley cultivar. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and looked at the gene sequences in the mutants.

The goal is to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that means we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided. The intact gene's first part is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ and the mutants have changes in this area.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene. Let's see. The original starts with ATGTTTCTC. Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACG. So position 4-8: original is TTTCT, mutant is TCTAC. So maybe a substitution. Let me write the first few codons.

Original: ATG TTT CTG TGG TAC TT...
Wait, wait, I need to look at the actual DNA sequences, not the protein. Because DNA is read in triplets, but the exons are coding regions.

Wait, the gene is the DNA sequence, so I have to see where the mutations are. The question says the mutations are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area.

So let's compare each mutant.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part: Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC G... Mutant 1 is ATG TCT AC G... So, the first change is from TTT to TCT, which is a substitution of the third T to C.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides:

Intact:
Positions 1-24: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG C...

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are. Let's see:

Mutant 1: The fourth nucleotide in the original is the start of the second codon. So the original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1 is AT
