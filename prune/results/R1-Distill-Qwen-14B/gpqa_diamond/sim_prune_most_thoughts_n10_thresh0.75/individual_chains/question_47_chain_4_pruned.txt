Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the IR data. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 usually indicate N-H stretching, maybe from an amide or amine group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Since the molecular formula has an oxygen count that's a bit high, maybe two oxygen-containing groups, like an ester and an amide, or an ester and an ether.

Looking at the NMR data next. There's a triplet at 1.20 ppm integrating for 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to something, probably an ethyl group because the triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So maybe an ethyl group, like -OCH2CH3 or maybe an ester's ethyl group.

Then, a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Broad signals often come from NH groups or from protons near an electronegative atom. Since the IR suggests N-H, maybe these 2H are part of an amide or amine. But wait, the molecular formula has only one N, so it must be a secondary amine or an amide. Hmm.

At 4.5 ppm, there's a quartet (q) integrating for 2H. Quartet usually means two neighboring groups with two protons each. So maybe this is the CH2 group from an esterâ€”like in ethyl ester where OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet because the neighboring CH3 is a triplet, but wait, the 1.20 ppm is the triplet for CH3. So that would fit with an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3.

Then, the aromatic protons. At 7.0 ppm, a doublet for 2H, and at 8.0 ppm another doublet for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring because the two doublets are each for two protons, and the coupling between the two sets would create that pattern. So the substituents are on opposite positions of the ring.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Let's think about the options given.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. But the substituents would be at the 3 and maybe another position? Wait, benzamide's CONH2 is typically at position 1, and ethoxy at 3. But that would make the substituents meta, not para. So the NMR would show more complex splitting, perhaps, but the aromatic protons might not come out as two doublets each of two protons. Because in para substitution, each pair of protons are equivalent, so they'd show as two doublets. 

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would be a formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The formamide would have an NH which might explain the IR peaks. The ethoxy would be at para position. The NMR would have the ethoxy as OCH2CH3, which would show up as the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The amide NH might be the broad peak at 4.0, but wait, formamide's NH is usually a broad peak, and maybe it's split if coupled. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each two H, as the substituents are para, which fits the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionyl group attached to the benzene, with an amino group at para. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COO- attached to benzene, and NH2. Let me think about the NMR. The ethyl group (from propionate) would be perhaps a triplet for the CH2CH3, but wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Or maybe it's CH2CH2-O-CO-NH2? Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene with NH2 in para? Wait, no, the structure is more likely O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O- attached? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the propionate ester would have an ethyl group, but perhaps the NMR would show
