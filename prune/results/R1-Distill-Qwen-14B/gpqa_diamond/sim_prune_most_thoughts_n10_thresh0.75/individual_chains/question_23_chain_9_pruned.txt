Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure in my mind. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- group, right? But wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure would be something like (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait. Let me break down the substituents.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, perhaps I should write it properly.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4 (since but has four carbons). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-
