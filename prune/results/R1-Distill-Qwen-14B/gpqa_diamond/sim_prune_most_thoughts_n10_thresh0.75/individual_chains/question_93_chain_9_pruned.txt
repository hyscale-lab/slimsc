Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The scenario is that a scientist is setting up a calibration curve for qPCR. He's using a positive control with known copy numbers, and he's run serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, right. 

So looking at the data, the Ct values for each concentration are as follows:

- 100,000 copies/µl: Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
- 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
- 1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

He wants to know why there are discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D.

First, I need to understand what each part means. The efficiency being 100% implies that each cycle perfectly doubles the target amount, right? So the PCR is working perfectly in terms of efficiency. R² of 1 means the data fits the curve perfectly, so the calibration curve is a good fit. The slope is -3.3. I remember that the slope of a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is ln(E)/ln(10), where E is efficiency. Wait, E is expressed as a decimal. Since efficiency is 100%, E is 1, so ln(1) is 0. Wait, that would make the slope 0. But wait, the slope here is -3.3, which doesn't make sense if E is 100%. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, actually, when you have a standard curve, the equation used is Ct = slope * log(concentration) + intercept. But wait, the slope is actually negative because as concentration increases, Ct decreases (since more copies mean it reaches threshold sooner). Oh right, right, so the slope is negative. 

Wait, the formula for slope in a standard curve when efficiency E is 100% (so E=1), the slope is -3.3219... because ln(10)/ln(2) ≈ 3.3219. Wait, no, the slope is calculated as (log10(E)) / (cycle efficiency). Wait, perhaps I should recall the standard formula. The standard curve is based on the formula: Ct = - (1/ slope) * log10(initial target amount) + intercept. Or wait, sometimes it's expressed as Ct = (log10(N0) * slope) + intercept. Hmm,
