Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the setup is about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So the question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then, when they do in vivo imaging, they see some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. That makes sense because the stomach has a lot of acid, which could break down proteins, including the GFP-tagged ones.

But some of the proteins make it through the stomach and get to the intestinal mucus. Then, they reach the secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and they look at the variable heavy chain gene in the proliferating cells. They see high variability there.

Hmm. So what's happening here? I think Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're sites where immune responses are initiated, especially against pathogens that enter through the gut. So when the rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, they're likely being processed by the immune system in the gut.

The proteins that aren't destroyed by stomach acid might be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like M cells in the Peyer patches. These cells capture the antigens and present them to B cells. Once the B cells are activated, they start proliferating and differentiating.

Now, the question mentions high variability in the variable heavy chain gene. I remember that during the immune response, especially in B cells, there's a process called somatic hypermutation. This process introduces mutations in the genes encoding the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing the diversity of antibodies produced. So each B cell clone can have a slightly different antigen-binding site, which helps in a more effective immune response.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This fits because it's about introducing mutations in the variable regions of antibodies, leading to diversity. Since the B cells are proliferating, they would undergo this process to generate more diverse receptors.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the immune response, especially in the classical pathway, but it's more about marking pathogens for destruction by phagocytes. It doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the antigen-binding site. It's about changing the function of the antibody rather than its specificity.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during the development of B cells and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It's the process that initially creates the diversity of the variable regions by recombining different gene segments. But this happens during the maturation of the immune cells, not during the response to an antigen. So in this case, the B cells are already mature and are responding, so VDJ isn't happening here.

So the process that's happening during the immune response, leading to high variability in the variable regions after antigen exposure, must be somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while the remaining proteins navigate the intestinal mucus and reach secondary lymphoid organs, including Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells are sequenced, revealing high variability.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and serve as sites for initiating immune responses to gut pathogens. Antigen-presenting cells, such as M cells, capture the rotavirus proteins and present them to B cells. Upon activation, B cells proliferate and differentiate, leading to changes in their variable heavy chain genes. The observed high variability in these genes suggests a process that increases diversity in the antigen-binding regions of B cell receptors.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors during the immune response, increasing diversity. It aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves marking pathogens for destruction but does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase the antigen-binding diversity.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not during the antigen-specific immune response observed in this experiment.

The process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the immune response to generate diverse antigen-binding sites. 

Answer: A
