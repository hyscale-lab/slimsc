Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a scientific experiment gone wrong. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're studying their developmental fate by using a bicistronic vector. So, I remember bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames), meaning two genes are in the same vector but expressed separately.

The vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. Wait, IRES is a Internal Ribosome Entry Site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF without the need for a second promoter, right? So the two proteins should be expressed from the same mRNA but under different regulatory elements.

Looking at the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, these are stop cassettes that use different loxP sites. So when Cre is present, it can excise these stops, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which makes sense as a loading control. So the expression is working, but when they breed the mice, and cross with SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show a green signal under the microscope. eGFP is the green fluorescent protein, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or is not fluorescent.

So why isn't the green signal showing up?

The options are A to D. Let's think through each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If they're expressed in different cells, the ligand would signal to the receptor in another cell. But the question is about the expression in the mouse. The construct is in the same cells, I think. So maybe the Cre is causing something... I'm not sure. But the issue here is about the expression of the construct, not the function of the ligand-receptor.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the protein isn't getting transported to the cell membrane. eGFP is usually used as a reporter for proper protein trafficking. If it's stuck in the Golgi, you wouldn't see fluorescence. But why would that happen? The IRES should allow expression. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, so the receptor isn't made. But wait, the construct uses loxP and lox2272, which are different sites. Cre would excise each, right?

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. Wait, noâ€”if the IRES is upstream, then the receptor would rely on the promoter of the ligand's mRNA. So if the promoter isn't driving the receptor's expression, maybe that's an issue. Or perhaps the enhancer is missing, so the promoter isn't active. But then why would the Western blot detect expression? They used the antibodies and saw signals, so perhaps the expression is working in vitro. But in the mice, maybe the Cre isn't properly activating the expression.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing the ORFs to be expressed. SOX10-Cre mice are crossed with the homozygous construct mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be active in those cells, excising the stops. So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the offspring, they don't see green. So why? Because the eGFP isn't expressed or isn't fluorescent.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh! If the receptor ORF is not in frame with the eGFP, then when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein but only if the reading frames match. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be properly expressed because the frameshift would lead to a premature stop codon. So the eGFP wouldn't be translated correctly.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 is excised, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single ORF. If the frames don't match, the eGFP won't be synthesized correctly. So on Western blot, would the antibody against the receptor detect it? Because the receptor should still be expressed, but the eGFP might not be. But in the question, the Western blot tested the expression after transfection. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the eGFP was expressed, but in the mice, the eGFP isn't. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins on the Western blot after transfecting into primary astrocytes
