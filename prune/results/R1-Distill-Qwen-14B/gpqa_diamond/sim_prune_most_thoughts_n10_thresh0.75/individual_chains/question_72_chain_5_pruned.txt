Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis problems can get pretty tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta is a norbornene structure, right? So it's like a bridge structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So that's the starting material.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. So I think this is a substitution reaction, perhaps an SN2? But wait, the structure has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene. So maybe it's a diels-alder reaction? Oh wait, no, because Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the tert-butoxy group is acting as a base. Wait, but wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Let me think. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So when these react with a strong base, maybe the dibromomethyl groups (which are good leaving groups) leave, and the cyclohexene would form a diene. Wait, but what's the other reactant? The starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. So tert-butoxy is a bulky base, maybe deprotonating something.

Alternatively, the reaction might be a substitution. The starting material has an oxygen, perhaps acting as a leaving group? Wait no, it's an ether. Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo... So the oxygen is connected
