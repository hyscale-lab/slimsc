Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to pick the correct sequence that leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a bromo group in the 3 position and a nitro group in the 5 position, and the ketone is attached in the 1 position. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone with the structure (R)C(O)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone. Structure: (CH3)2CO. But in this case, it's 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one, which would be the ketone connected directly to the benzene ring. So benzene with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, and the rest of the substituents are at the meta and para positions?

Wait, no, let me think again. 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the phenyl group. The phenyl group has bromo in position 3 and nitro in position 5. So wait, benzene ring: positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, the numbering here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to number the benzene ring. The phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). So the substituents on the benzene are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (which would be position 1). So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). Wait, but that would imply a 1,3,5 substitution pattern. But wait, the molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the phenyl has the ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, no. Actually, the numbering starts from the ketone. So the ketone is position 1. Then the next substituents are at 3 and 5. So the ring has a ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: at positions 1 (C=O), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

Now, how to get there from benzene. The starting material is benzene. So I need to perform a series of reactions that will add these groups in the correct positions.

Let me think about the possible reactions
