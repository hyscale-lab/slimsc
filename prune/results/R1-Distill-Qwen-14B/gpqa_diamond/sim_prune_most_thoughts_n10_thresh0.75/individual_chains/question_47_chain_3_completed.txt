Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound is correct. The question gives me a molecular formula, IR data, and 1H NMR data, and I have to choose between four options. Let me break this down step by step.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, and O is 2. Assuming no halogens (X=0), so plug in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees. That could be five rings, but more likely a combination—probably a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees: three double bonds or one ring plus two double bonds), plus maybe an amide or ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad, which usually indicates N-H or O-H stretches. But since the options don't have hydroxyl groups, maybe these are N-H stretches. So the compound has an amide group perhaps. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a good clue. That's typically a carbonyl stretch. Could be ester, amide, or ketone. But in this case, the options likely involve either an amide or ester.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something deshielded.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 or NCH2 group. Or possibly an NH group, but NH protons usually show up much broader and sometimes even in different regions, but in this case, maybe it's adjacent to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2. So maybe something like OCH2CH3, but wait, the triplet at 1.2 is probably the CH3 of an ethyl group. So the quartet at 4.5 would be the adjacent CH2. So that makes sense—if it's an ethyl ester, for example, like OCH2CH3, but wait the quartet is on the CH2 attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, but looking at the options, some are amides, some are esters. Let's see.

The aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets. That usually suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, you have two protons on one ring and two on the other, each as doublets. So the benzene ring has substituents in the para positions.

So putting that together, the compound has a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think about the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But benzamide is CONH2, but wait, no: benzamide is Ph-C(=O)-NH2. But in this case, the substituents would be ethoxy at position 3, which is meta to the amide. The NMR would show a triplet for the ethoxy CH3, which is what we have at 1.2 ppm. The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2. But then what about the NH2 protons? They would show as broad peaks, but in the NMR, I don't see any peaks around 2-3 ppm that are broad. Hmm. Also, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could be the amide carbonyl. But wait, the amide's carbonyl is typically around 1680-1650 cm-1, but maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So structure is O=CH-NR-Ph-OEt. Wait, formamide would have a carbonyl next to NH. So the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which matches the IR. The ethoxy group would have triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NMR would have the ethoxy CH3 as triplet, which is present. The OCH2 as quartet at 4.5, which would be correct. Now, the formamide has an NH group. The IR shows NH stretches at 3420 and 3325, which would fit. The NMR: the NH protons would typically show up broad, perhaps as a singlet around 8-9 ppm? Or maybe if it's an amide, the NH could be exchanging and not show up clearly. Wait, in the NMR given, I don't see any peaks in the 8-9 ppm range. The highest is 8.0, which is a doublet. So maybe the NH isn't part of the aromatic region. Alternatively, since it's an N-substituted amide, maybe the NH is somewhere else.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that's CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph, but wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-; so the structure would be Ph-NH-COO-(CH2)2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so attached to the amino group. So it's NHPh connected to a propionate ester? Alternatively, maybe it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But looking at the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2 are indicating an ethyl group. So for a propionate, I'd expect a triplet for the CH2CH2COO, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ethyl ester. But the molecular formula would have more carbons if it's a propionate.

Wait, let me check the molecular formula for each option.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Because benzamide is C6H5CONH2 → C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C7+2=9, H7 +5=12? Wait, that's getting a bit confused. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2 (Ph-C(=O)-NH2). If we have an ethoxy group attached to the benzene in the 3 position, that would add C2H5O. So the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9. H: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. The ethoxy is O-C2H5. So the H count would be 7 (from benzamide) + 5 (from ethoxy) = 12. But wait, the benzamide has 7 H including the NH2. So when we add ethoxy, we replace a H on benzene. So the total H would be 6 (from benzene, 5 H in benzamide minus one H replaced by OEt, which has 5 H in ethoxy? Wait, no, the benzene in benzamide is C6H5, so after substitution, it's C6H4-OEt. So the ethoxy group is O-C2H5, which has 5 H. So the total H would be 5 (from C6H5) – 1 (replaced by OEt) = 4 +5 (from OEt) = 9? Plus the benzamide has NH2 which is 2 H. So total H: 9 +2 = 11. Oh wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O. So option A is C7 (benzamide) + C2 (ethoxy) = C9. H: Benzamide (C7H7NO2) has 7 H. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) replaces a H on benzene with OEt, which has 5 H. So the H count would be 7 (C7H7) -1 (H replaced) +5 (OEt) = 11? No, wait: the benzamide is C7H7NO2, which is C6H5-CONH2. So the benzene has 5 H (since the substituent is at position 3, which is one substituent). Adding OEt to the benzene would replace one H, so benzene becomes C6H4-OEt, which has 4 H (since two substituents: CONH2 and OEt in positions 3 and 1? No, wait, benzamide is para? Wait, no: 3-ethoxy would be meta to the amide. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is OEt attached to benzene, and amide group. So formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see: benzene is 6 C. CONH2 is 3 C (C=O, NH2). OEt is O and C2H5. So total C: 6 +3 +2=11? No, wait: wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2 (C6H5-CONH2). If we add an ethoxy group, that's O-C2H5. So the formula becomes C7 (from benzamide) + C2 (from ethoxy) = C9. H: Benzamide is C7H7NO2 → 7 H. The ethoxy group contributes 5 H. But since it's replacing a H on the benzene, so total H is 7 (benzamide) -1 (replaced H) +5 (OEt) = 11. So yes, C9H11NO2. So molecular formula matches.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONR2) where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So formamide is HCONR2. So the formula would be C8H9NO3? Wait, let's see: phenyl group is C6H5. 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H4-O-C2H5. So that's 6 + 2 = 8 C. Formamide adds C=O and NH. So the formula would be C8 (from phenyl) + 2 C (from formamide: HCONR2?), wait no. Let me recount. Formamide is HCONR2. So R is C6H4-OEt. So the formula is: 

HCONR2 → H-C(=O)-N-R2.

R is C6H4-O-C2H5.

So the molecule is HCON(C6H4OCH2CH3)2? No, wait, formamide is HCONH2. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2, but for N-substituted formamide, like HCONR2, where R is aryl.

So for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: structure is HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)C6H4.

Wait, no, the structure should be H-C(=O)-N-(4-OCH2CH3-phenyl). So the formula: C (from HCO) is 1, O from CO is 1, N is 1, then the phenyl is 6 C, O from ethoxy is 1, and ethoxy has 2 C. So total C: 1 (HCO) +6 (phenyl) +2 (ethoxy) = 9 C. H: Let's see:

HCO: 1 H.

Phenyl: 4 H (since in para position substituted by OEt and the HCO group?), wait no, the phenyl is at position 4, so substitution is in para. So the substituents are OEt and HCONH- on the benzene ring. So the benzene would have 4 H. Ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3), but wait, the substituent is OEt, which is O-C2H5, so 5 H.

Then, the formamide group: HCONH-... So the HCONH- part contributes 2 H (the NH). So total H: 4 (from benzene) +5 (from OEt) +2 (NH) +1 (from HCO) = 12 H? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So this doesn't add up. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me recount.

Formamide part: HCON-.

The N is attached to the phenyl group (C6H4-OEt). The phenyl is C6, OEt is C2. So the total C is 6 (phenyl) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (CO) +1 (from H) → 10? Wait, no, the CO is part of the formamide. Let's see: the entire molecule is HCON-(C6H4-OEt). So the carbons: 1 (from HCO) +6 (phenyl) +2 (ethoxy) → 9 C. So 9 C. That matches. Now, H: 

HCON- group: 2 H (H and NH).

Phenyl group, which is para-substituted with OEt and HCON-: so the benzene has 4 H.

OEt group: 5 H.

Total H: 2 (from formamide) +4 (benzene) +5 (OEt) = 11 H. So that's correct.

So molecular formula for option B is C9H11NO2. So yes, it matches.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH-COO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be an amino acid maybe. Let's check the formula. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H13N O2. Let me calculate:

Phenyl (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

NH group: adds 1 N.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO- → 3 C, 5 H (CH2CH2COO- has 3 C and O's).

So total C: 6 +3 +1 (from NH?) No, the structure is Ph-NH-COO-(CH2)2CH3. So the molecule is Ph-NH-COO-(CH2)2CH3. So:

Ph: 6 C.

NH: 1 N.

COO: 2 O.

(CH2)2CH3: 3 C.

So total C: 6 +3 =9. That's correct.

H count: Ph has 5 H (since substituent is NH-COOEt... wait, no, substituent is NH attached to COO. So the benzene has 4 H (since it's para substituted: one substituent is NH-COO... So 4 H on benzene. Then the NH contributes 1 H. The propionate group: the COO is connected to (CH2)2CH3. So the ethyl part would have 2*2 +3 =7 H? Wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is CH2CH2COO-: that's 2 carbons in the chain. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- (propanoic acid). So the ester would be OCOO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ethyl part is CH2CH2CH3. So the H's in the propionate: the CH2CH2CH3 group has 2+2+3=7 H. Wait, no: CH2CH2CH3 is CH2CH2CH3, so each CH2 is 2 H, and the CH3 is 3 H. So 2+2+3=7 H. But in the ester, the O is connected to CH2CH2CH3, so the OCH2CH2CH3. So that group has 7 H.

But let's sum up all H: 

Ph group: 4 H.

NH: 1 H.

Propionate OCH2CH2CH3: 7 H.

Total: 4 +1 +7 = 12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's 4-aminobenzoic acid propyl ester? No, the options say 4-aminophenyl propionate. So maybe the propionate is attached to the amino group. So structure is PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let me recalculate.

Ph: 6 C.

NH: 1 N.

COO: 2 O.

CH2CH2CH3: 3 C.

So total C: 6 +3 =9 → correct.

H count: Ph group has 4 H (para substituted). NH: 1 H. COOCH2CH2CH3: the CH2CH2CH3 has 2+2+3=7 H. Wait, but in the ester group, the O is connected to CH2CH2CH3, which is (CH2)2CH3. So that group has 2+2+3=7 H. But the carbonyl is connected to the NH, so maybe the structure is O=C(O-)–O–CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, propionate ester is R-O-CO-PhNH-. So the O is connected to CH2CH2CH3. So the propionate group contributes 7 H.

So total H: 4 (Ph) +1 (NH) +7 (propionate) =12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So this doesn't match. Therefore, option C is not correct.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is CH2CH3O-CO-PhNH2. So the ester group is OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl, and the benzene has an amino group in para position. Let's check the molecular formula.

Benzoate is C7H5NO2 (PhCOO-), but with ethyl ester (OCH2CH3), so:

PhCOOCH2CH3 → C7 (Ph) + C3 (COOCH2CH3) = 10 C? Wait, no. Wait, benzoate is C6H5COO-. So for ethyl benzoate, it's C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2. But in this case, the benzoate has an amino group in para position. So the structure is PhNH2-COOCH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. So PhNH2 attached to the carbonyl which is attached to OCH2CH3. So molecular formula: Ph (C6H5) has 5 H. Then, COOCH2CH3 contributes 3 C (COO is part of the benzoate, but the ethyl is 2 C). Wait:

4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester → C6H4(NH2)COOCH2CH3. So C: 6 (Ph) +2 (COO) +2 (ethyl) =10 C? Wait, no. Wait, the benzoate is C7H6O2, but with the ethyl ester, it's C7 +2=9 C. Let me recount:

Ph (C6) + COO (2 C) + ethyl (2 C) → 6+4=10 C? No, wait: Ph is C6, COO is 2 C (from COO), and ethyl is 2 C. So 6 +2 +2=10 C. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So 10 C doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, 4-aminobenzoate is C7H7NO3? No, let me think again. Benzoate is C6H5COO-. So 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H4(NH2)COO-. So molecular formula is C7H7NO3. Then, when it's the ethyl ester, it's C7H7NO3 + C2H5O → C9H12NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C9H11NO3. Because the parent acid is C7H6O3 (benzoic acid with NH2). So ester would add the ethyl group, making C9H11O3? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. So option D might not be correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but let me go back to the NMR data.

The NMR has a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), which suggests an ethyl group (CH2CH3). The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is likely the adjacent CH2. So that's typical of an ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3), but also possibly an ethyl ether or amine.

Looking at the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the substituents are para to each other on the benzene ring. So perhaps there's a carbonyl group and an ethoxy group in para positions, or a carbonyl and an amino group.

Wait, looking at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So the molecule has a carbonyl group, which could be an ester, amide, or ketone. But given the options, it's likely an ester or amide.

Looking back at the options, option D is an ester. So it would have the carbonyl as an ester. So in the NMR, the ethyl ester would show triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5, which matches. Then, the aromatic region would have substituents in para positions.

Wait, but in option D, the substituents are the amino group and the ester. So the benzene would have NH2 and COOEt in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each 2H. That fits the NMR.

So, the NMR for option D would have:

- triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3).

- quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).

What about the NH2 group? The IR has strong bands at 3420 and 3325, which are probably the N-H stretches. So the NH2 would absorb in the IR. But in the NMR, NH protons are usually broad, but in this case, the NMR doesn't have any signals that look like they could be NH. However, sometimes in the case of amines, especially if they are de-shielded or in certain environments, the NH may not show up in the NMR or could be a singlet elsewhere. Or perhaps the amine is in a different environment, such as being an aromatic amine, which can be broad or not show up.

Wait, the NMR data provided doesn't have any peaks beyond 8.0 ppm. If there's an NH2 group, it would typically appear around 1-5 ppm or so, but more likely as a broad peak. However, in the NMR data given, the only broad signal is at 4.0 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That doesn't fit with an NH2 group because NH2 protons are usually not singlets and would be split. So perhaps the NH is part of an amide or something else.

Wait, let's think about all the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is PhNH2-COOEt. So, the benzene has NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The COOEt group would have the OCH2CH3, which would give triplet and quartet in NMR. The NH2 protons would appear as a broad signal, perhaps as a singlet, but in the NMR, the only broad is at 4.0 ppm, which is 2H. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine, perhaps it's exchanging and not showing in the NMR. But in the IR, the strong peaks at 3420 and 3325 would correspond to the N-H stretches, which are present in option D.

So, the NMR for option D would have:

- triplet at 1.2 for CH2CH3.

- quartet at 4.5 for OCH2.

- the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

The NH2 would have protons, but maybe they're not showing up in the NMR for some reason, or perhaps they're integrated into another peak.

But looking at the options again:

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-(4-OEtPh). The formamide's carbonyl would appear as a strong IR peak around 1700, which matches. The ethoxy group would give the triplet and quartet. The NH would be part of the formamide, which is a secondary amide. The NH protons in an amide typically appear as a broad peak around 7-8 ppm. But in the NMR data, the highest peak is at 8.0 ppm, which is a doublet for aromatic protons. So maybe the NH is not showing up, or perhaps it's split or integrated elsewhere.

Alternatively, the formamide's NH could be in the range of 8 ppm. But in the NMR data provided, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet for 2H, which is part of the aromatic ring. So perhaps the NH is not appearing in the data. Or maybe it's a different structure.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OEt and CONH2 in meta positions. So the benzene would have OEt and CONH2. So the aromatic protons would be a triplet and a quartet? Wait, no. Benzamide with substituents in meta would cause the aromatic protons to split differently. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

Wait, the aromatic region for option A would have more complex splitting. If the substituents are in meta, the aromatic protons would be a doublet of doublets or something else. But the NMR shows two doublets, which is more characteristic of para substituents. So option A might not fit the NMR data.

So, putting this all together, let's think about each option's fit with the data.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

IR: Strong carbonyl at 1720 (matches amide or ester). The N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 would fit the formamide's NH.

NMR: triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). The aromatic doublets fit para substitution.

But what about the formamide's NH in the NMR? It's a secondary amide, so the NH would be a broad peak around 7-8 ppm. But the NMR data doesn't show a peak beyond 8.0 ppm except for the aromatic doublet. Hmm, maybe the NH is not shown due to exchange broadening and the peaks are integrated into the aromatic signals, or perhaps it's a different structure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

IR: strong carbonyl at 1720 (ester).

NMR: triplet and quartet from ethyl ester. Aromatic protons as two doublets (para substitution). The NH2 would show a broad peak, but in the NMR data, the only broad peak is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't match, as the NH2 would be 2H and show as a broad signal elsewhere.

So, this might not fit.

Option B: So the NMR would have the ethyl group as triplet and quartet, which matches. The aromatic protons are two doublets, which fits para substitution. The IR has the carbonyl and the NH stretches. The only issue is the missing NH in the NMR.

But wait, the NMR given has 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). If the substituents are OEt and formamide group (HCO-NHR), then the aromatic protons would be in the vicinity of 7 and 8 ppm. For example, in para substitution, the protons ortho to the substituents would be downfield. So if one substituent is electron-withdrawing (like OEt is slightly electron-withdrawing), and the other is HCONH- (formamide), which is also electron-withdrawing, the protons ortho to these substituents would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide group is in the para position, causing the adjacent protons to be downfield. So the 8.0 ppm would be the protons adjacent to the formamide group, and 7.0 ppm adjacent to the ethoxy group.

So, the NMR for option B would have:

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): protons next to OEt.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): protons next to formamide.

The formamide's NH would be in the NMR data as a broad peak, but perhaps it's integrated into another peak or not shown. Alternatively, the formamide's NH is at around 8 ppm but as a broad peak. But the data shows a doublet at 8.0 ppm, which is 2H. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the formamide's NH isn't showing up because it's exchanging and broad, but in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, what about option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In this structure, the substituents on benzene are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. The COOEt group would have the ethyl signals. The NH2 would have protons that are broad, but in the NMR, the only broad is at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which doesn't fit.

So that's a problem. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR of option D. The ester group OCH2CH3 would give a quartet at around 4.2-4.3 ppm and triplet at 1.2 ppm. So in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield, but that's possible. The aromatic protons would be in the 7.0-8.0 range as two doublets.

What about the NH2 group? The NH2 in para position would be H2N-Ph-COOEt. The NH2 protons are likely to be broad and possibly around 1-5 ppm. But in the given NMR, the only broad signal is at 4.0 ppm. That's 2H. So it's not matching the expected 2H from NH2.

So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Going back to option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is HCONH-(4-OEt)Ph. So the NH is part of the formamide, which is a secondary amide. The NH would have protons, but in the NMR, no peaks are indicating that. However, perhaps the NH is not visible because it's broad and maybe integrated into the aromatic region, which is already showing two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is with the aromatic protons, but in the given data, there's no indication.

Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's NH is de-shielded and appears as a singlet around 8.0 ppm, but that's a doublet in the data. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the splitting in the aromatic region. The two doublets in NMR suggest that each set of two protons is coupled with one neighboring proton. That's typical in a para-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are strong enough to cause the splitting. So each proton is next to one substituent and adjacent to another proton. Wait, no: in para substitution, each proton is adjacent to another proton on the same ring, which causes coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would each have one neighboring proton, leading to doublets. So yes, two doublets in the NMR, each integrating for 2H.

So the substituents are in para position, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So the substituents could be an electron-withdrawing group (like ester or amide) and an ethoxy group.

In option B, the substituents are OEt and HCONH- (formamide). Both are meta directors, but in para positions here. The formamide is more electron-withdrawing than the ethoxy, which is slightly electron-donating. So the protons adjacent to formamide would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those adjacent to ethoxy.

In the NMR data, the higher ppm peak is at 8.0, which would be adjacent to the formamide group, and the lower at 7.0, adjacent to OEt.

So, this fits.

Now, the issue remains with the NH in the NMR. But perhaps the formamide's NH is de-shielded and appears as a peak that's not visible in the given data, or perhaps it's an exchange broadened peak that's not resolved.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH is part of the aromatic region, but that doesn't make sense because it's a secondary amide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the NH is split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), which is for the OCH2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure doesn't have an NH that's visible in the NMR for some reason. But in the IR, the NH is clearly there.

So, putting it all together:

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which fits a formamide. The ethoxy group gives the triplet and quartet in NMR. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, which fits para substitution. So the best fit would be option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the formamide's NH would have a peak in the NMR, but none is present. Unless it's an NH that's not splitting and is a singlet, but in the data, the only singlet is at 4.0 ppm. Hmm.

Another angle: looking at the NMR's 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). What could that be? It's a broad singlet, 2H. Perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. If the NH is adjacent to an oxygen or something else. Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group attached to an oxygen, but that usually gives a quartet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to an amide.

Wait, in option B, the structure is HCONH-(4-OEt)Ph. The NH is attached to the carbonyl. So the NH would be part of the amide. The adjacent group is the phenyl. So the NH wouldn't have any neighboring protons except potentially the aromatic protons. But aromatic protons are usually not coupled with NH protons due to the distance.

So the NH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, the only singlet is the triplet at 1.2. The other signals are q, d, or bs. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, which could be something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the structure. Alternatively, perhaps option D is more plausible.

Wait, for option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The ethoxy group gives the triplet and quartet. The NH2 would be present as a broad peak, but perhaps it's not visible in the NMR data provided.

Wait, the NMR data doesn't show any peaks beyond 8.0 ppm except the aromatic. So, if the NH2 is present, but not shown, then perhaps option D is the correct one.

But the IR has strong NH stretches, which are present in option D. The IR would show NH stretches for an amine.

Wait, option D is an ester, so the carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1, which fits. The ester group would have the ethyl triplet and quartet.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits.

The NH2 would have protons, but in the NMR, the only broad signal is at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which is a singlet. That doesn't fit the NH2.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here.

Another approach: let's look at the integration.

The 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → possibly an NH2 group, but it's a singlet, which is unusual. NH2 is usually a broad peak but not a singlet unless in a very symmetric environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → ethyl CH2.

The aromatic protons are 4 H in total (two doublets, each 2H).

So, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) is the CH2 adjacent to O or N. For example, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be at around 4.2-4.3 as a quartet. But the data has it at 4.5, which is a bit upfield, but possible. Or if it's attached to N, like in an amide.

Wait, in amides, the adjacent CH2 would be deshielded and appear downfield. So if the structure is something like OCH2 or NCH2, perhaps.

Looking at option B: HCONH-(4-OEt)Ph. So the NH is attached to the carbonyl. The only CH2 groups are in the ethoxy. So the 4.0 ppm (2H) can't be part of the ethoxy, because the quartet is at 4.5. So perhaps this 4.0 ppm is from another group, but I'm not seeing where that would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an NH2 group, but as a singlet. That doesn't make sense because NH2 protons are usually not singlets.

Wait, another thought. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D), the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be part of the amino group. But amino groups are NH2, which would show as a broad peak, not as a singlet. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2, but in that case, it would be a quartet.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should compare the options again.

Option B's structure has an ethoxy and formamide group. The NMR has the ethoxy signals, the formamide's carbonyl, and the aromatic signals. The only missing part is the formamide's NH, but perhaps it's not visible in the given NMR data.

Option D has an ethoxy (from ester) and amino group. The NMR would have the ethoxy signals, the aromatic signals, and the amino group. But the amino group's protons aren't visible in the given data.

Given all this, perhaps option B is the correct one because it fits the IR and NMR except for the missing NH, but this could be due to the limitations of the NMR data provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) is from the NH2 group. Wait, NH2 protons are usually broad and in a different region. If they're in a different environment, perhaps they're showing up as a broad singlet elsewhere. But in the given data, the only possible spot is 4.0 ppm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or nitrogen, such as in an ether or amine. For example, in option D, the ester group has OCH2CH3, which is quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2. So the remaining 2H at 4.0 could be from something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt.

So, the ester group OCH2CH3 is accounted for in the NMR (quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2).

The amino group is NH2. So the NH2 would have protons that are broad, but maybe in the NMR data, they're not visible or perhaps the integration is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group is part of the structure but not showing up in the NMR, which is possible if it's exchanging rapidly or not split.

But given that the IR has strong NH stretches, that's expected in option D.

So, putting it all together, which option fits the data?

The IR has carbonyl at 1720, which is more consistent with an ester (option D) or an amide (option B). The NMR has the ethyl group, which fits both B and D. The aromatic protons fit both.

The NH stretches in the IR are present in both B and D.

So, how to decide between B and D.

Looking back at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Molecular formula: HCON-(4-OEtPh) → C= O, N, and the rest.

Ph is C6H5, OEt is C2H5O. So the formula is C6 (Ph) + C2 (OEt) + C1 (HCO) + N → C9 H? Let's calculate:

Ph: C6H5 →5 H.

OEt: C2H5O →5 H.

HCO: 1 H.

NH: 1 H.

Total H: 5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +1 (HCO) +1 (NH) =12. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, the structure is HCONH-(4-OEtPh). So for the molecular formula:

Ph is C6H5 →6 C,5 H.

OEt is C2H5O →2 C,5 H.

HCO is 1 C,1 H.

N is 1.

Total C:6+2+1=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +1 (HCO) +1 (NH) =12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So option B has 12 H, which doesn't match. So option B is incorrect.

Ah, so this is a key point. So option B's molecular formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2. So option B is out.

That leaves option D as a possibility.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt → C7H7NO3 (benzoate) + C2H5 → C9H12O3. Wait, that would make C9H12O3? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. Let me recount.

Ph is C6H5: 6 C,5 H.

COOEt is O-CO-OEt? No, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the COOEt group is:

COOEt: 2 O, and the ethyl group is C2H5.

So the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:

Ph (C6H5) → C6, H5.

NH2 → N, H2.

COOEt → COO-C2H5 → C3 (COO is 2 C, ethyl is 1 C?), wait:

COOEt is O=C-O-OEt (No, COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3).

So the COOEt group has 3 O and 3 C (COO is 2 C, ethyl is 1 C). So:

Ph: C6, H5.

COOEt: C3, H5 (OCH2CH3 has 5 H).

NH2: N, H2.

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +2 (NH2) =12.

O:3 (from COOEt) +1 (from COO-) → no, wait, the formula for benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt. So it's C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2. But with an NH2 group in para position, it's C6H4(NH2)COOCH2CH3. So molecular formula: C6 (Ph) + C3 (COOEt) + N → C9H? Let's calculate.

Ph: C6H5 →6 C,5 H.

COOEt: C3O2.

NH2: adds N and 2 H.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:5 (Ph) + (from COOEt: OCH2CH3 →5 H) +2 (NH2) →5+5+2=12.

O: from COOEt, which is O2. So O=2.

N:1.

So the formula is C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substituents.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C7H6O2 + C2H5 → C9H11O2. But with the NH2 group, that adds 2 H and 1 N. So the formula becomes C9H13NO2. Which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2.

Wait, perhaps it's not ethyl benzoate but another ester. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me try calculating option C.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNHCOO(CH2)2CH3.

Molecular formula:

PhNHCOO: C7H7NO3.

Plus CH2CH2CH3: C3H7.

So total C:7 +3=10 → doesn't match the given C9.

So option C is out.

So, back to the options, only option D has the correct degree of unsaturation and molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate option D.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5.

COOEt is C3H5O2.

So, molecular formula is C6 + C3 =9 C.

H: Ph has 5 H.

COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3).

NH2 has 2 H.

Total H:5 +5 +2=12.

O:2 (from COOEt).

N:1.

So formula is C9H12NO2.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H too many. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not an ester but an amide. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester. So it should have formula C9H12NO2. Which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2.

So perhaps none of the options fit, but that's unlikely. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial molecular formula analysis.

The given formula is C9H11NO2.

Which totals: 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Formula is C9H11NO2 → matches.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Earlier calculation suggested it would have 12 H, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, formamide is HCONH-R. So the formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) →6 C,5 H.

OEt →2 C,5 H.

HCONH →1 C, 1 H, 1 N, 1 H (from NH).

So, C:6 +2 +1=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +1 (HCO) +1 (NH) =12 → but given formula is 11 H.

So option B is incorrect.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: formula is C9H12NO2 → doesn't match.

So only option A has the correct molecular formula.

Wait, option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: Ph-OEt and CONH2 in meta positions.

Ph-OEt: C6H4-OEt.

CONH2: adds 2 O and 1 N.

So molecular formula:

Ph-OEt is C6 + C2 =8 C.

CONH2: adds 2 C (C=O and NH2).

So total C:8 +2=10. Wait, that can't be right because the given formula is C9.

Wait, no: benzamide is C7H7NO2 (Ph-CONH2). Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO2.

So option A's formula matches.

So, let me check the NMR for option A.

Structure: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

So the substituents are OEt and CONH2 in meta positions on the benzene. The NMR would show splitting in the aromatic region. But in the given NMR, there are two doublets, each 2 H, which suggests para substitution, not meta. So the substituents are in para, which option A doesn't have.

Thus, the NMR data doesn't fit option A.

Wait, but the substituents are in meta, so the aromatic protons would be more complex. For example, the ortho and para positions to the substituents would have different shifts.

But the given NMR shows two doublets, which is more consistent with para substitution. So option A is less likely.

So, the only option that fits the molecular formula is option A, but the NMR doesn't fit. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): could be NH or OCH2.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2.

Aromatic protons: two doublets, 2H each.

If the structure is an ethyl ester (option D), then the OCH2 would be at 4.5 (quartet), and the ethyl CH3 at 1.2 (t).

The aromatic protons would be two doublets in para positions.

The NH2 would have protons, but perhaps they're not visible in the NMR provided.

The IR would have a strong carbonyl at 1720 (ester) and NH stretches at 3420 and 3325.

So option D fits the IR and NMR, except for the NH2 not showing up in the given data. But the molecular formula for option D seems to have one more H than given.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is C9H11NO2.

How?

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5.

COOEt is C3H5O2.

NH2 is CN.

So molecular formula: C6 + C3 =9 C.

H: Ph (5) + COOEt (5) + NH2 (2) →12 H.

But given formula is 11 H. So that's a problem.

Hmm, unless it's not an ester. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituents. Maybe the structure is Ph-O-CO-NH2.

No, that's a urethane, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Ph-NH-COOEt. Which is an amide, not an ester.

But that would change the formula.

So the structure would be Ph-NH-COOEt.

Ph (C6H5) →6 C,5 H.

NH-COOEt → C4H5O2N.

So total C:6 +4=10 → no, given formula is C9.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CONH-Et.

But that's not one of the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another angle.

The NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H). So the ethyl group is likely connected to an oxygen, making it an ether or ester.

If it's an ester, then the structure would have R-O-CO-R'.

Looking at the options, option D is an ester (ethyl benzoate derivative). Option B is a formamide with ethoxy.

The IR for the ester would have a carbonyl at ~1720 cm-1, which matches.

The aromatic protons in para substitution would appear as two doublets, which matches.

The NH2 in option D would have to account for 2 H, but it's not appearing in the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the NH2 is part of an aniline group, where the protons are exchanging rapidly and not visible as a separate peak. So, the NMR might not show the NH2, but the IR would show the N-H stretches.

So, considering that, option D would fit the data except for the NH2 not showing up in the NMR.

But the molecular formula for option D would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think about option C.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH-COO-(CH2)2CH3.

So the propionate is attached to the amino group.

The molecular formula would be:

PhNH: C6H5NH → C7H7N.

COO(CH2)2CH3: C4H7O2.

Total C:7 +4=11 → but given formula is C9. So option C is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, despite the molecular formula discrepancy. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for option D is C9H11NO2.

Wait, PhNH2-COOEt:

Ph: C6H5 →6 C,5 H.

COOEt: C3H5O2.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt) +2 (NH2) =12 H.

But the given formula is 11 H. So that's a problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the NH2 is part of a ring. No, the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't an ester but an amide. Let me check option A and B.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is Ph-OEt and CONH2 in meta.

Molecular formula: C9H11NO2 → matches.

But the NMR shows two doublets, which would be para substitution. So that doesn't fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-(4-OEtPh). Formula would be C9H12NO2, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for option B. Let's see.

Formamide: HCONH-R.

R is 4-ethoxyphenyl → C6H4-OEt.

So molecular formula:

HCO: 1 C, 1 H, 1 O, 1 N.

Ph-OEt: 6 C + 2 C =8 C.

So total C:1 +8=9.

H: HCO has 1 H.

Ph-OEt has 5 H (OEt) +4 H (from benzene, since substituents are OEt and HCONH- in para → 4 H on benzene).

NH: 1 H.

Total H:1 +5 +4 +1=11.

So formula is C9H11NO2. Which matches.

Ah! So earlier I made a mistake in calculating option B's formula. So option B's molecular formula is correct.

So now, the issue is the NMR. The structure is HCONH-(4-OEt)Ph. So the substituents are in para positions.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The ethoxy group gives the triplet (1.2 ppm) and quartet (4.5). The formamide's NH would have protons. But in the NMR data, there's a broad peak at 4.0 ppm (2H), which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH. But in formamide, the NH is a secondary amide, which usually appears as a broad peak around 7-8 ppm. But the given data has a peak at 8.0 ppm as a doublet, which is the aromatic protons. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the NH is exchanging and not showing up, but the IR shows the NH stretches, so it must be present.

So, the conclusion is that option B fits the molecular formula, IR, and NMR except for the NH issue. But perhaps the NH isn't visible in the NMR provided, or perhaps it's integrated into another peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) is from another group, but I can't think of what else would be in the structure.

Given all this, the correct answer is option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.


The question involves identifying the compound C9H11NO2 using IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula indicates a degree of unsaturation of 5, suggesting a benzene ring (3 degrees) and additional unsaturation likely from a carbonyl group. The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (likely N-H stretches) and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl stretch, likely from an amide or ester). The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), and two doublets in the aromatic region at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm (2H each).

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- **Structure**: A benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the meta position (3).
- **Molecular Formula**: Matches C9H11NO2.
- **NMR Fit**: The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at 1.20 ppm and a quartet at 4.5 ppm. However, the aromatic region for a meta-substituted benzene would not produce two doublets but rather more complex splitting. This does not match the NMR data, which shows two doublets (indicative of para substitution).

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- **Structure**: A formamide (HCONH-) attached to a para-substituted benzene with an ethoxy group.
- **Molecular Formula**: Matches C9H11NO2.
- **NMR Fit**: The ethoxy group accounts for the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm. The para-substitution pattern explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The formamide's NH would typically appear as a broad peak, but it may not be visible in the provided NMR data, possibly due to exchange broadening or integration issues. The IR data supports the presence of an amide (N-H stretches and carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹).

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- **Structure**: A propionate (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a para-substituted benzene with an amino group.
- **Molecular Formula**: Does not match C9H11NO2 (it would have more carbons and hydrogens).
- **NMR Fit**: The ethoxy group signals would not align with the data, and the molecular formula mismatch eliminates this option.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- **Structure**: An ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3) attached to a para-substituted benzene with an amino group.
- **Molecular Formula**: Does not match C9H11NO2 (it would have more hydrogens).
- **NMR Fit**: The ethoxy group signals would align with the data, and the para-substitution pattern explains the two doublets in the aromatic region. However, the amino group's NH protons would typically appear as a broad peak, which is not visible in the provided NMR data. Additionally, the molecular formula mismatch eliminates this option.

### Conclusion:
Option B, **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, is the best fit for the molecular formula, IR data, and NMR data. The ethoxy group explains the triplet and quartet in the NMR, and the para-substitution pattern explains the aromatic doublets. The formamide's NH may not be visible in the NMR due to exchange broadening, but the IR data supports its presence.

**Answer: B**
