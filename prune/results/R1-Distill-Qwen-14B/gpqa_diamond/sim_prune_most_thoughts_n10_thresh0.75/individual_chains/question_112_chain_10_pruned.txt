Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator given a specific state. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me see.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator. That means they form an orthonormal basis. So, the state can be written as a linear combination of these basis states.

But wait, the problem says it's proportional. So I probably need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the state vector should have a norm of 1.

So the normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let me compute that. The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the inner product is (1-i)(<up|) + (2+i)(<down|) multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Calculating that, the inner product will be (1-i)(1+i) for the |up> squared term, plus (2+i)(2-i) for the |down> squared term, and the cross terms. Wait, but since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the cross terms will be zero. Because <up|down> = 0.

So, <alpha|alpha> is |1
