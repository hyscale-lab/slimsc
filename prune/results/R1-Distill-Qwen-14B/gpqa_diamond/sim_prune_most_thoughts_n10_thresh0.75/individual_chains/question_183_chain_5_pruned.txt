Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So, the formula to calculate it is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H hydrogen, X halogens, and N nitrogen. But wait, in this problem, the product is formed after a reaction, so I need to figure out what that product looks like first.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering is such that the formyl group (CHO) is at position 2, and the vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-) is at position 5. Also, there's a double bond at position 3, so cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Additionally, the ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) has substituents at positions 2 and 5. The carboxylic acid group is at position 3? Wait, no. Maybe the numbering is different. Let me think.

Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring is numbered such that the double bond starts at 3. Then, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So, position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent). So the structure would be cyclohexene with a formyl group on carbon 2, a vinyl group on carbon 5, and a carboxylic acid group on carbon 3? Or wait, maybe the carboxylic acid is part of the ring. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the cyclohexene has a double bond between 3 and 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Or position 3? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then the substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). Hmm, I think it's best to draw the structure mentally.

So, cyclohexene ring: let's imagine it's a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, no, a vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So C5 would have a CH2–CH2– group, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, no, I think the structure is that the cyclohexene is the ring with a double bond, and at C5, there's a vinyl substituent, meaning a double bond coming off that carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituents. So the molecule is:

- A cyclohexene ring (six-membered, double bond at 3-4)
- At position 2: formyl (CHO)
- At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH– attached to the ring)
- Also, the ring has a carboxylic acid group; wait, wait. The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring at position 3? Wait, no, in the nomenclature, the numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the main chain is the cyclohexene, and the substituents are numbered accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring has a carboxylic acid group at
