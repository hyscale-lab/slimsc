Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about electrons, positrons, and photon emission after annihilation. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. We're supposed to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron has gamma =4, positron gamma=2. But since the positron is moving from the right towards the left? Or wait, the positron is moving from the rightâ€”so if the electron is moving left to right, and the positron is moving right to left? Or am I getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so from left to right. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so from right to left. So they're moving towards each other on the same line. So when they collide, they annihilate into two photons.

So the initial setup: electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same line. After annihilation, two photons are emitted. Both photons have same energy, but one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are in the upper and lower right, but their angle apart is what's needed.

Wait, but since the initial particles are moving along the same line (the horizontal axis), the total momentum before collision must be considered. So the system's total momentum will be conserved in the collision. The two photons must carry away momentum in such a way that the total momentum equals the sum of the initial momenta of the electron and positron.

Wait, but wait: when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the annihilation occurs at a point, the center of mass frame might be important here. But photons are massless, so their energy and momentum are related by E = pc.

So, let's think about the initial momenta.

Each particle's momentum can be calculated using their Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is
