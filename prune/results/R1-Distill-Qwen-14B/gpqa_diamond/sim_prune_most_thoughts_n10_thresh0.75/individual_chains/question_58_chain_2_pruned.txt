Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. But wait, let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with particles as strings, right? Strings have a length scale, the string length, which is related to the Planck scale. Since strings are extended objects, maybe they don't suffer from the same divergences as point particles. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Does superstring theory require regularization? I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "ultraviolet" regulator isn't there in the same way because the theory's perturbative expansion (like the string perturbation theory) is finite beyond a certain point. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Alternatively, string theory might not have the same issues with renormalization because the string interactions are different. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But I'm not 100% certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and the theory becomes weakly interacting. But regardless, QCD calculations often lead to divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So you need regularization to handle those infinities. Techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization are used here. So QCD does require regularization, so option B is out.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has issues with divergences, especially in higher-order corrections. For example, the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These require regularization methods. Techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization are used. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical electromagnetism, we don't have divergent loop integrals because there are no loops; it's all about solving Maxwell's equations with charge distributions. In classical E&M, the theory is well-behaved, right? There are no infinities in the same way because you don't have the same renormalization issues. So classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's a classical theory without the quantum divergences. So option D would be the one that never requires regularization.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization, so the correct answer would be the one that is free from the need for such techniques. So, going back:

Which theories are free from requiring regularization? Superstring theory is a quantum theory, but perhaps it doesn't require regularization because it's free from the same divergences. Or maybe because it's a background field theory with certain symmetries that make regularization unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe because in string theory, all interactions are consistent and don't lead to the same divergent loop diagrams as in QFT
