Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about comparing two terms in a hydrogen atom's energy levels: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE. The setup is that there's a magnetic field B, which is parallel to the Oz axis. The magnetic field value is 1 Tesla, and the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism in atoms involves the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and an external magnetic field. In the hydrogen atom, which has one electron, this would probably relate to the Zeeman effect, which splits the energy levels when an external magnetic field is applied.

Wait, the Zeeman effect has two parts: the normal and the anomalous. But I think for this problem, we're looking at the normal Zeeman effect, which is when the splitting is due to the interaction of the electron's orbital magnetic moment with the external field.

The paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy shift due to this interaction. The formula for the Zeeman energy is something like ΔE_zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital magnetic moment, μ = -m * (eħ)/(2m_e), right? So the energy shift would be proportional to m and B.

Wait, but wait. For hydrogen, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Since the problem says m is small, maybe m is 0, or ±1, something like that. So the paramagnetic term would be proportional to m*B.

But for the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are primarily determined by the principal quantum number n. The transition energy ΔE given here is when the hydrogen atom emits or absorbs a photon of wavelength 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series transition, I think. The Balmer-alpha line corresponds to a transition from n=2 to n=3 or something? Wait, no, wait. The Balmer series is when an electron transitions to the n=2 level. Oh right, the 0.4861 micrometer wavelength is the Balmer-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So I can compute ΔE using that. Let me note down the constants: h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is about 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 is 4.906e-19 J. That's the order of magnitude of ΔE.

Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term? The Zeeman energy shift is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but wait. The orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e) * m. So the energy is μ·B = (μ_B) * m * B. The Bohr magneton is μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So if m is small, say m=1, then ΔE_zeeman ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, let's compare this to ΔE. We have ΔE ≈ 4.906e-19 J, and the paramagnetic term is about 1e-23 J. Wait, that's way smaller. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. Am I getting the terms right? Because the transition energy here is the energy difference between two states, which is much larger than the Zeeman splitting. Because for hydrogen, the energy levels are mainly determined by the principal quantum number, but the magnetic field causes a small splitting.

In the absence of a magnetic field, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. When you apply a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect causes a shift, but this shift is small compared to the original energy levels.

So comparing the two terms: paramagnetic coupling (Zeeman shift) is about 1e-23 J, and the transition energy is about 5e-19 J. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but the question is about the expectation value of H, which I think refers to the Hamiltonian. The paramagnetic term is part of the Hamiltonian, but it's being compared to the transition energy. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, which is the energy of the photon emitted or absorbed. The paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman shift. So which is bigger?

In the hydrogen atom, the energy levels without the magnetic field are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is about -
