Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two values.

Hmm. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think for this problem, the neutrino's mass can be considered negligible compared to the other particles. So, maybe I can approximate its mass as zero. That should make the calculations easier.

So, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, if the muon's momentum is p, the neutrino's must be -p. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, so they have momentum, but their mass is negligible. So, their energy would be approximately equal to their momentum since E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², and m is almost zero. So E ≈ pc for neutrinos.

Now, let's break down the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu * c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p * c, because m_nu is negligible.

So, energy conservation gives:
m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu
Which is:
139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + K_mu) + E_nu

Also, from momentum conservation, since the total initial momentum is zero, the momenta must cancel. So, the magnitudes are equal. So, the momentum of the muon p_mu equals the momentum of the neutrino p_nu. But wait, the muon's momentum is given by p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v, but maybe it's easier to use the relation involving energy and mass.

Wait, another approach: because the total momentum is zero, the momenta of the two products are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me set up some variables. Let me denote the kinetic energy of the muon as K_mu, and that of the neutrino as K_nu. But wait, neutrinos have kinetic energy too, but since their mass is negligible, their entire energy is kinetic plus their rest mass. But wait, their rest mass is nearly zero, so E
