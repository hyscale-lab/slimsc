Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its orbital period, but wait, no, actually, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and its albedo. Oh right, because the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

So the problem says the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 is about 2.3. So I can find the ratios of their temperatures. Also, the mass ratios are given, but wait, how does mass relate to orbital period? Well, wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The orbital period depends on the mass of the star and the distance of the planet from the star. Oh, but wait, the question says the masses of the planets are given, but Kepler's law depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. Hmm, maybe the mass ratios are a red herring? Or perhaps it's about the TTV method—transit timing variations—so the masses of the planets affect the TTV signals, but for orbital period, maybe only the distance and the star's mass matter. But in this problem, the star's mass isn't given. So perhaps we can assume that the star's mass is the same for all planets, so their distances are determined by their orbital periods via Kepler's law. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets. So Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, meaning Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2. Then Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is 35% more massive than Planet3. So Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2, which is 1.35 times Planet3. So Planet1 is 1.15 * 1.35 ≈ 1.5525 times Planet3's mass. But does planet mass affect the orbital period? I think not directly. Because Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star), divided by the mass of the star. So if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, which it is, then the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period. So perhaps the mass ratios don't matter for the period calculation here. Or wait, maybe the TTV method's data gives information about the masses, but for the periods, the Keplerian relation is based on the planet's distance and the star's mass. 

But the problem doesn't give any information about the star's mass, so perhaps we can assume that the star's mass is the same for all three planets, so the only variable is the distance. So the orbital period depends on D^(3/2), with the star's mass in the denominator. But without knowing the star's mass, how can we find the ratio of periods? Wait, maybe the equilibrium temperature relates to distance, and from that, we can find the distances, and then use Kepler's law to find the period ratios.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L*(1-a)) / (16 * sigma * D^2) ]^(1/4). So T is inversely proportional to D^(1/2), because if you solve for T, T is proportional to (1/D^(1/2)). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4. So D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3, so (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2. But D2 is 1.96 D1, so D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 10.38 D1. So D3 is about ten times D1.

Now, Kepler's third law says that the orbital period P is proportional to D^(3/2) / (M_star)^(1/2), but since M_star is the same for all planets, the ratio of periods will be (D3/D1)^(3/2). So D3 is 10.38 D1, so (10.38)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.38)^3. Let's calculate sqrt(10.38). Sqrt(10) is about 3.16, sqrt(10.24)=3.2 (since 3.2^2=10.24), so sqrt(10.38) is about 3.22. So cube that: 3.22^3. Let's compute 3^3=27, 3.2^3=32.768, 3.22^3 would be roughly (3.2^3) + (0.02)*(3^2) * 3.2 + ... Hmm, alternatively, 3.22 *3.22=10.368, so 10.368 *3.22. Let me compute 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.368 *3.22≈1.186, so total ≈33.386. So approximately 33.4. 

So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1. But wait, the options include option D as ~33.4. So the answer would be D. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. 

First, the temperatures:

T1 / T2 = 1.4 → (D2 / D1)^(1/2) = 1.4 → D2 = (1.4)^2 D1 = 1.96 D1.

T2 / T3 = 2.3 → (D3 / D2)^(1/2) = 2.3 → D3 = (2.3)^2 D2 = 5.29 D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 = about 10.3784 D1.

Then, the period ratio P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3784)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3784^(3/2).

Compute square root of 10.3784: sqrt(10)=3.1623, sqrt(10.24)=3.2, sqrt(10.3784)=approx 3.222.

So (3.222)^3 = 3.222 *3.222 *3.222.

Compute 3.222 *3.222 = 10.378 (since sqrt(10.3784)=3.222, so square is 10.3784, but wait, 3.222^2=?

Wait, 3.222 *3.222:

3 *3 =9, 3*0.222=0.666, 0.222*3=0.666, 0.222 *0.222≈0.049.

Wait, that's not right. Let me compute it properly:

(3 + 0.222)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.222 + 0.222² = 9 + 1.332 + 0.049284 = approx 10.381284.

So 3.222 squared is approximately 10.3813.

Now, multiply that by 3.222 again to get the cube.

10.3813 *3.222.

Let me compute 10 *3.222 =32.22.

0.3813 *3.222:

0.3 *3.222 =0.9666

0.08 *3.222=0.25776

0.0013 *3.222≈0.0041886

Adding: 0.9666 +0.25776=1.22436; +0.0041886=1.22855.

So total is 32.22 +1.22855≈33.4485.

So approximately 33.45. So the period ratio is about 33.45 times. So the answer is option D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physical principles:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relation**:  
   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star:  
   \[
   T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
   \]  
   Using the given temperature ratios:  
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \implies \sqrt{D_2 / D_1} = 1.4 \implies D_2 / D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).  
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \implies \sqrt{D_3 / D_2} = 2.3 \implies D_3 / D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).  

   Combining these, \( D_3 = 5.29 \times D_2 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \times D_1 \approx 10.38 \times D_1 \).  
   Thus, \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.38 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   The orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the \( 3/2 \)-power of the distance \( D \):  
   \[
   P \propto D^{3/2}
   \]  
   Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.38 \):  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.38)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.38} \approx 3.22 \). Then, \( (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4 \).  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
