Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given some DNA sequences and their corresponding numerical outputs. I need to figure out the pattern or the rule that's being applied to convert the DNA sequences into numbers. Then, using that rule, I can determine what the output should be for the given sequence ACAGTGACC.

Let me look at the examples provided. The first input is AGG, and the output is 115. The second input is TGCTGA, and the output is 176. Hmm, I need to find a pattern that connects the DNA sequences to these numbers.

DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. Each of these corresponds to a number in the genetic code, right? Wait, but how? I remember that each nucleotide has a specific weight in certain calculations. Oh wait, maybe each base is assigned a numerical value, and the total is the sum of each base's value in the sequence.

Let me think. If that's the case, what values do these bases have? Let's consider possible assignments.

Looking at the first example: AGG. Let's see, A, G, G. If I can find a value for each letter such that their sum is 115.

Wait, but maybe it's not about each base's value. Another possibility is that each base's position in the sequence contributes to the sum. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, it could be the sum of the positions of each nucleotide in the alphabet. Like A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Let me test that.

Wait, AGG would be A=1, G=7, G=7. So sum is 1+7+7=15. But the output is 115. Hmm, that's not matching. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps each base is assigned a two-digit number, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Wait, but that would give AGG as 1+4+4=9, which is way off. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe each nucleotide is converted to its complement, like A to T, T to A, C to G, G to C. But I don't see how that would help with the number conversion.

Wait, perhaps each base is given a specific value based on its position in the genetic
