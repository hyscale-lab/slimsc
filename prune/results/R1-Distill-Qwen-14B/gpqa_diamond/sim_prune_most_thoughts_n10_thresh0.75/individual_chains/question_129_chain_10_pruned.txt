Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are four steps from A to E, and some hints and options provided. Let me break down each step and the given information.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR data, 1750 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably in A. E's peak at 1715 is also a carbonyl, but maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or another carbonyl group. But since E is the product after elimination, maybe it's a ketone.

Let's start with hint a. The reaction of A with a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So A must have a carbonyl group because the Wittig would react with that.

The product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. 

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent with a double bond. So perhaps it's attached via a double bond. So the substituent is a propenyl group, maybe.

So, the product of the Wittig is a cyclopentane with two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and the propan-2-ylidene (which is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached via a double bond) at position 4.

Wait, the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1 (CH3), 2 (CH3), and 4 (a substituent that's a propenyl group, maybe).

So, the Wittig reaction involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. The ylide is the source of the alkene part. The aldehyde or ketone in compound A would have a structure that, upon losing the oxygen (the carbonyl) and forming a double bond, would produce the product.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with a propenyl substituent. So, perhaps the starting material A is a cyclopentanone (since the Wittig would react with ketones). Alternatively, maybe a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, let me think again. The Wittig reaction adds a new double bond. So if the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenyl group (CH2-CH(CH3)-), perhaps the starting carbonyl in A was at position 4 of cyclopentane, and the Wittig added the substituent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me represent this structure.

The cyclopentane ring has five carbon atoms. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so it's a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the substituent is a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is actually (CH2)2-C=, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propenyl group attached via the double bond. So the substituent at position 4 is a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-, but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group. Let me think, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's a propenyl group where the substituent is attached via the double bond—like CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond, but that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The Wittig reaction forms a new double bond. So the product has a new double bond where the carbonyl was in compound A.

So, compound A must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the cyclopentane ring. So, for example, cyclopentanone (a five-membered ring with a ketone group). But the product after the Wittig would have a double bond where the ketone was.

Wait, cyclopentanone would react with the Wittig reagent to form cyclopentene. But the product here is more complex, with substituents at 1,2,4.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2 (methyl), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). The propenylidene group must be connected to the ring at position 4.

So perhaps A is something like 4-methylcyclopentanone. Wait, but then the Wittig would form a double bond between carbons 4 and 5, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about how the Wittig works. The ylide has a structure like Ph3P=CH-R. When it reacts with a carbonyl, say R'-CO-R'', it forms R'-CH2-CH-R with a double bond.

Alternatively, the ylide might add to the carbonyl, then release Ph3P=O and form a double bond. So the position of the substituents would depend on the structure of the starting carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents. For example, if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig would replace the ketone with a double bond.

Wait, but the product after Wittig would have a double bond where the ketone was. So if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then the product would be 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene. But that's not what the product is—it's 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, so perhaps A has a ketone at position 4. Let me visualize:

If A is 4-(propan-2-yl)cyclopentanone, then the ketone is at position 4. When the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts, it would form a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. But the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's try to think differently. The product after the Wittig is a cyclopentane with substituents at 1, 2, and 4. So, the substituent at 4 is a propenylidene group, which is a double bond substituent.

Wait
