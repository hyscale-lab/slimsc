Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this particle physics problem. Let's see what the question is about. The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian interaction term is L(y) = -λf f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me look again. Oh right, it's written as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo in the way it's written, but I think what's important is the interaction. So, the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible decay channels.

So, I remember that for a boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion involved. Because when particles decay, the energy must be sufficient to produce the rest mass of the decay products.

Wait, but what fermions are involved here? The interaction term in the Lagrangian tells us which fermions X can couple to. Let's parse the interaction term. The term is something like -λ f f-bar (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, this looks a bit confusing. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term. The general form for Yukawa interactions is something like g ψ ψ X, where X is the scalar field. Or perhaps this is a term like λ f (y) (ψ_f(y))† ψ_f(y) (X + υ), but perhaps I'm getting the exact form wrong. But the key here is that X couples to fermions f. So, the fermions that X can decay into are the ones that X couples to.

So, the first thing to figure out is which fermions X couples to. The Lagrangian term here suggests that X couples to fermions f. So, looking at the interaction, X is interacting with fermions ψ_f. So, which fermions are these?

But I'm a bit stuck because the term is written as -λ f f-bar (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps that's a typo and the correct term is something like -λ f ψ_f-bar (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), which would make sense as a Yukawa interaction term. Because Yukawa interactions are usually of the form g ψ ψ X, where X is the scalar field (the boson here). So perhaps the correct term is -λ X ψ_f-bar ψ_f. That would mean X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, but in the given expression, it's written as f f-bar, but maybe that's just a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the term is -λ X f-bar f, indicating that X couples to the fermion f. So, f could be any fermion, but perhaps in this case, f is a specific type.

Alternatively, maybe this is a typo, and the correct term is L = -λ X f-bar ψ_f, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is between the scalar X and a pair of fermions. So, for example, X can decay into a fermion and its antifermion.

So, the key is to determine which fermions are accessible, given the interaction term. Let's assume that X couples to all possible fermions, but perhaps the problem is more about the mass threshold.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given by the Lagrangian, so the boson X can only decay into fermions that it couples to. So first, we need to figure out which fermions X can interact with.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe it's better to consider that the term is -λ f (ψ_f)† (y) (X(y) + υ) ψ_f(y). So, that would be a Yukawa term, implying that X couples to the fermion ψ_f, which could be any fermion, such as a quark or lepton.

Wait, but the form is a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure. The term in the Lagrangian would typically be a scalar, so each field must be at the same point y. So, the term -λ f (y) (X(y) + υ) (ψ_f†(y) ψ_f(y)) would make sense. So, f is
