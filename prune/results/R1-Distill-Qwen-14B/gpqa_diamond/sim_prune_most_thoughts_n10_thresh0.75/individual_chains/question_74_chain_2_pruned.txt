Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So the problem is about an atom that hasn't decayed yet, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, I think I remember something about decay probabilities and half-lives from my classes. Oh right, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right?

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, wait. So the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%. But wait, how do probabilities work in radioactive decay? I think the probability of decay over a certain time is related to the decay constant.

Let me recall the formula. The probability P that a nucleus decays in time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Oh wait, or is it P = λt when λt is small? Hmm, no, no, I think it's the first one because it's a continuous process. So the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), and the probability it has decayed is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but in this problem, the given probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means P(100) = 0.32. So I can set up the equation:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Let
