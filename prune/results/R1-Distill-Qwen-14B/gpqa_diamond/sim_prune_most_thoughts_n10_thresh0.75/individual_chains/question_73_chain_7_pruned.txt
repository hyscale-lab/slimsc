Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

First, relative speed. Wait, in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities don't add linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. I remember the formula for adding velocities in relativity is something like (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1*v2)/c²). Let me get that right.

So astronaut A's velocity is 0.6c, astronaut B is at 0.5c. But wait, wait. Wait, the question is about their relative speed. So if they are moving in the same direction, then from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or is it the speed of one as seen from the other's frame?

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't symmetric. So the speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ), but wait, no, because in the same direction, the velocity addition formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²)), where v is the speed of the frame relative to the original frame.

Wait, no, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think. The velocity of an object in the frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So if I'm in frame A, which is moving at 0.6c, and frame B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as frame S (the lab frame), then the velocity of B as seen from A is (0.5c - 0
