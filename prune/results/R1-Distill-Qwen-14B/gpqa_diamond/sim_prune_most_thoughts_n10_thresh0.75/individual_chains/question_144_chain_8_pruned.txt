Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonance decay and finding the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question gives me some data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, and choose between four options.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is cτ, where τ is the lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given parameters?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should check the units here. ħ is in units of GeV·s, I think. Or wait, no, ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Or is it? Let me get that straight.

So, Γ is given in MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Now, τ = ħ / Γ. So τ would be (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the lifetime. And the speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second. So the decay distance would be c * τ. So 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 6.17e-16 meters. Wait, but none of the options are exactly this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate more carefully.

Calculating τ: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Then cτ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters. Hmm. Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, and D is 4.0655e-16. Neither of these match. Did I use the right formula?

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should include the concept of the particle's velocity. Because the mean decay length is actually c * β * γ * τ, where β is v
