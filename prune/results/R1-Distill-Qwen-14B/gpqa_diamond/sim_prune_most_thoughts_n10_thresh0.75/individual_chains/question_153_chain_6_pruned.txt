Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about Michael additions. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, and the reaction is typically conjugate addition.

The problem has three parts, each a different Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and match them with the options provided: A, B, C, etc.

Let's look at each part one by one.

**Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**

First, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but wait, wait—no. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt?, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- as the ester. So methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, the numbering. Wait, the substituents on the acrylate. Wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents are on the beta carbon, which is the CH2=CH-C-(p
