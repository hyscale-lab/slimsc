Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is that a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and they've got some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

Let's break down the data provided.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, molecular weight is 156, but there's a peak 2 units higher. I remember that in mass spectrometry, a molecular ion peak can sometimes lose or gain a proton. Wait, but wait, 158 is 156 plus 2. Oh, maybe it's a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the molecular ion at 156 is likely Cl-35, and the peak at 158 would be Cl-37 plus something else? Wait, m/z 158 is 156 +2, so maybe it's the Cl-37 isotope. So the molecular weight is 156, but when Cl is present, the isotopic peaks come into play. So the molecular weight would be (for Cl compounds) either 156 or perhaps 157? Wait, wait, let's think. Chlorine is around 35.5, so a molecule with Cl would have an average molecular weight, but the molecular ion is at 156. So another thing that might cause a shift is the presence of a double bond or something else. Alternatively, there's another possibility: could the molecular ion be the [M]^+ ion, and the 158 is [M + H]^+? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 156 + 1 is 157, not 158. So perhaps the 158 is the Cl-37 isotope peak.

So the molecular formula probably includes Cl because the isotopic pattern is showing Cl.
