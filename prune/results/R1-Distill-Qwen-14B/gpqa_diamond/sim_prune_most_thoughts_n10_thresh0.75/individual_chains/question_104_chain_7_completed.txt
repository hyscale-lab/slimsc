Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection method used is the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet, and this movement shifts the spectral lines. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit. But how exactly?

The formula I think is involved here is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). The formula is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) 

But wait, since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar-mass, M_p << M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e≈0, so the denominator (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. So the formula simplifies.

Let me write this down properly. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^{1/3} * (1/(P))^{1/3} ) * ( (1/( (1 + (M_p/M_star))^{2/3} )) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_star)^{1/3} ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so the denominator becomes approximately M_star^{2/3} * (something close to 1). So K is approximately proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^{2/3}) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

Wait, but in this problem, M_p and M_star are the same for both planets. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have similar mass to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. So M_p is the same for both, M_star is same for both. Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 should be inversely proportional to (P1/P2)^{1/3}.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (8 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} (1 - e^2)^{1/2} ) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

But assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (something) * (M_p) / (M_star^{2/3}) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

So K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}. Therefore, K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) 

Which can be rearranged as (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Alternatively, (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact relation. Because K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, so K is proportional to 1/(P^{1/3}).

So K1 = C * (1/P1^{1/3})
K2 = C * (1/P2^{1/3})

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So in this problem, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is 0.364 * P1. So it's shorter. So the question is how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's. Since it's shorter, the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the relation again. Because sometimes when I'm tired, I might mix which way the ratio goes.

If K is 5 for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2, then since K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, a higher K means a shorter period. So planet 2 has a higher K, so it must have a shorter period than planet 1.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1. So if K1=5 and K2=7, K1/K2=5/7, so (5/7)^3 is about 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's about 0.36 times as long, so the ratio is 0.36.

Which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The semi-amplitude of the velocity shift, \( K \), is proportional to \( 1/P^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. Since the stars and planets have the same mass in both cases, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \), the ratio is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Cubing this ratio gives:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's, the answer is approximately \( 0.36 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
