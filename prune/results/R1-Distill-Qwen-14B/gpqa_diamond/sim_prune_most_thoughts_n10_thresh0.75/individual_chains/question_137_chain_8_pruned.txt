Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about a proton being injected into a synchrocyclotron. I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles. The key difference, I think, is that cyclotrons have a constant magnetic field, while synchrocyclotrons vary it to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. 

The problem states that the proton starts at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0, and undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with U0 being 190 kV and Φ0 = π/4.

Hmm, wait. Synchrocyclotrons use an alternating voltage to accelerate particles. Each time the voltage completes a cycle, the particle gains a certain amount of energy. But wait, the proton is moving in a magnetic field, so its orbit radius increases as its energy increases. How does this affect the number of revolutions?

I think the key here is the concept of "synchronous" acceleration. The idea is that the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted so that the particle completes an integer number of revolutions each time it gains a specific energy increment. This is to ensure that each time the voltage is applied, the particle is in the right position to be accelerated.

Wait, but the question is about the number of revolutions the proton makes as it goes from T=0 to T=950 MeV. So I need to find how many times the proton orbits the synchrocyclotron during this acceleration process.

Let me recall the formula for the kinetic energy gained in a cyclotron. In a cyclotron, the kinetic energy gained per revolution is equal to the voltage applied. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the situation is a bit different because the magnetic field isn't constant. Oh wait
