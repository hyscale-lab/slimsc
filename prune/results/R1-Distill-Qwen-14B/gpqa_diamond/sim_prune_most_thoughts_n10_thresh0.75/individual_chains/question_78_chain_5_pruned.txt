Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at time t, which is after the time tr when the field was generated. So, the potentials depend on retarded time or something like that.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is moving, the potentials are not just determined by the charge's position but also its velocity and maybe acceleration. Oh right, the scalar potential is due to the charge's position, while the vector potential involves the charge's motion, like velocity.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential, but considering the retarded time. So the standard formula is V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the point r. But wait, the options have different forms. Let me look at the options.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is v²/c² times V. Hmm, but I think A is usually proportional to velocity, not velocity squared. Not sure yet.

Option B: V is same as A, and A is v/(c²) times V. That makes sense because in Lorenz gauge, the vector potential is related to velocity. But wait, the denominator in the scalar potential here is just r, but I think the correct expression includes a term involving (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the field point r. Oh wait, because the charge is moving, the potential isn't just based on the current position but the past position. So the denominator should involve the distance and the velocity term.

Wait, the setup says that vector d is from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So d is the vector from where the charge was at tr to the observation point. So the distance is |d|, but in the potential expressions, there's a term that accounts for the motion of the charge. Oh right, there's a term (d·v) in the denominator because of the relative motion.

Hmm, so
