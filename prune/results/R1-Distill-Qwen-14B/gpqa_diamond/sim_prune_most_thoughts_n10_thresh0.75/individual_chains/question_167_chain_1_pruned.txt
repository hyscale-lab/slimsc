Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The problem says the state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which they've given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Oh wait, and the non-Gaussianity is calculated using this relative entropy measure, delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the given state's.

The question asks for the non-Gaussianity when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. So let's see what we need to do here.

First, I think I should find the density matrices rho and tau. But wait, what's tau? Oh, it's the density matrix of a Gaussian state. For Schrödinger cat states, the Gaussian reference is usually a coherent state? Or maybe a thermal state? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity compares the state to the most Gaussian state possible, which is the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense. But wait, in this formula, tau is a reference Gaussian state, not necessarily the closest. Hmm, but I think for the relative entropy measure, it's the difference between the state's entropy and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. Wait, no, the formula here is just the difference between rho and tau, regardless of their closeness. Wait no, the formula is the difference between the two entropies. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that maximizes the entropy or something? Or is it that the reference Gaussian is just a specific one, like the vacuum or a coherent state?

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the state. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>, right? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian, like a cat state.

So to compute rho, I need to construct the density matrix of |psi>, which is |psi><psi|. Let me write that out. So rho = |psi><psi|.

But wait, the
