Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. But wait, three spins, so the total number of states should be 2^3 = 8. Right.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Oh wait, J is a coupling constant. So each term S_i S_j contributes. I need to compute E for each possible state and then calculate the product of exponentials for each state.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that could take some time, but maybe there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as T. So T = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J T. So the exponent in the partition function becomes exp(β J T) because E is -J T, so β E is -β J T, and the exponential is exp(-β E) = exp(β J T).

So for each state, I need to compute T, then sum exp(β J T) over all states.

Hmm, what are the possible values of T?

Each S_i is ±
