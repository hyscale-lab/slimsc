Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene ring (which has 6 carbons) plus the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, but di-substituted could mean that each substituent is a single group, but perhaps one or both have more carbons.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so the two substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other a single. But wait, if both are substituents on the ring, each substituent can't have more than one carbon unless they're like -CH2- groups or something.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. So one substituent is a carbonyl group. And it also has an aromatic-halogen bond, which means another substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc. So the two substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen.

Wait, but carbonyl groups in aromatic compounds are typically either carbonyl-containing substituents like -COOR (ester), -COR (like ketone, but that's not possible directly attached to benzene because it would be a ketone group, which is possible as a substituent), or maybe a carbonyl as part of an acyl group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), which has a carbonyl. But aldehyde substituents on benzene rings are possible, though maybe less common than others, but it's possible.

So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like -CHO) and a halogen (like
