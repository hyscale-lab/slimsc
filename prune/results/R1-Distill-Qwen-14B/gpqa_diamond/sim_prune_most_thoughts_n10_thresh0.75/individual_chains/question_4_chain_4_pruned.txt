Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. They include things like Gauss's laws for electric and magnetic fields, Faraday's law of induction, and Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction.

In our universe, Gauss's law for magnetism says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic poles, so the field lines have to form closed loops. So the equation is ∇·B = 0. If in another universe, you could have isolated magnetic monopoles, then this equation would change. Because then B would have sources and sinks, so the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, ∇·B would equal some term related to the magnetic charge density, maybe like rho_m or something.

But the question is about which equations are different. So the first equation, Gauss's law for magnetism, would definitely be different. But wait, are there any other equations that might change?

Looking at the other equations: Gauss's law for electricity (the one with electric charge) would remain the same because that's about electric charges, which aren't directly affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles. Faraday's law, which deals with the curl of the electric field, also probably remains the same because it's about induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields. But wait, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, would that change anything? Hmm, maybe not, because Faraday's law is about how B changes affect E, regardless of whether B has divergence or not.

Wait, what about Ampère's law? In our universe, Ampère's law includes Maxwell's addition of the displacement current. But Ampère's law itself is about the curl of H being equal to the current plus the displacement current. I don't think that would be affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles. Unless... but wait, no, Ampère's law relates H and the currents, which are electric currents. So that wouldn't change.

So the only equation that would change is the divergence of B. But wait, the question says which Maxwell’s equations look different
