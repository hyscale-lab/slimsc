Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents given are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group. All three are meta to each other. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if one is in position 1, the next would be position 3, and the third position 5, but wait, let me think. No, wait, meta substituents are on positions 1,3,5 perhaps? Or in a way that each is meta to the others.

Wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the others. That would mean they form a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? Because each is meta to the others, which would place them at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If substituents A, B, and C are all meta to each other, then each is in a position such that two are meta and another pair are meta. So, for example, if A is at position 1, B at position 3, then C would be at position 5. Because 1 is meta to 3, 3 is meta to 5, and 5 is meta to 1. Yeah, that makes sense. So the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the carboxylic acid (let's call that COOH), the carbaldehyde (CHO), and the cyano (CN) are all meta to one another. So each is meta to the others. So perhaps each substituent is meta to the other two. So, let's say COOH is at position 1, then the CHO would be at position 3 (meta to COOH), and the CN would be at position 5 (meta to COOH and also meta to CHO, since 3 and 5 are two positions apart, which is meta). So positions 1,3,5 have COOH, CHO, CN.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2) group. So the COOH is at a position, say position 1. Ortho to it would be positions 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2.

And para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is across the ring, so if COOH is at position 1, para is position 4. So position 4 has OMe (methoxy).

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the alcohol (position 2 or 6) are also both ortho to the nitrile group (CN). So let's see where the nitrile is. The nitrile is at position 5, as per earlier assumption. So ortho to position 5 are positions 4 and 6. Wait, but the nitrile is at position 5, so ortho would be 4 and 6. So the substituents at 4 and 6 must be attached to the nitrile's ortho positions.

Wait, the methoxy is at position 4, so that's ortho to nitrile. The hydroxyl is at position 2 or 6. So for the hydroxyl to be ortho to the nitrile, it would have to be at position 6 (since 5 is nitrile, 4 and 6 are ortho). So the hydroxyl is at 6, and the dimethylamino is at 2.

So let me try to map all substituents:

COOH at position 1.

Ortho to
