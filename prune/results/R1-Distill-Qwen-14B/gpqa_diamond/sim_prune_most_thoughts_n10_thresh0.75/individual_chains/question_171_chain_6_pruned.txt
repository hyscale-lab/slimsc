Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of bromine with different aromatic compounds. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, activating and deactivating groups influence where the substitution happens.

The substances given are 1 to 6, each with a benzene ring attached to different substituents. So, I think I need to determine the activating or deactivating nature of each substituent and whether they are ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Because that will tell me about the major product, which would be the para isomer if the substituent directs para.

Wait, the substituents are:

1) C6H5-CH3 → That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron donor (it's an alkyl group, so +I effect). Activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. So for substance 1, the major product would be a mix of para and ortho, but since it's a strong activating group, the para isomer would be more favored than meta. Or wait, no, in the case of activating groups, they direct to ortho and para, so the para would be a major product but might not be the only one.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → That's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, perhaps it's a benzoyloxy (OCOC6H5) attached to ethyl? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So it's a phenyl group connected to a carbonyl group (CO) and then an O connected to ethyl. So that's a phenyl acetate group? So the substituent is OAc (acyloxy group). Acyloxy groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta-directing. So the para product would be less for this substituent. Wait, but deactivating groups can still direct meta; so in this case, the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing, which means that the incoming bromine would substitute in the meta position more than the para. So for substance 2, the para isomer would be minor, right? So the weight fraction of para would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl → That's a chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's a deactivating group because of the electronegativity (electron-withdrawing via inductive effect), but it's ortho/para-directing due to resonance (since Cl has lone pairs that can donate electrons through resonance). So in chlorobenzene, the Cl directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. So the para isomer would be a major product. Wait, but since it's deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing would still be ortho/para. So for substance 3, the para product should be a major product, possibly more than the orth
