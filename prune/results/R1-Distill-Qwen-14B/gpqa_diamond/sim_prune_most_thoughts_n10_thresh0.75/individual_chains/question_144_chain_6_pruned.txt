Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D, with some numbers in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula should involve the lifetime, which I think is connected to the width through the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is related to the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula. Oh wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, I think that's right. So once I have τ, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, right? So L = v * τ.

But what's the speed of the meson X? Since it's a resonance, perhaps I should calculate its velocity using its energy and mass. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the velocity using the relativistic equations.

Wait, the production energy is E_X = 8 Ge
