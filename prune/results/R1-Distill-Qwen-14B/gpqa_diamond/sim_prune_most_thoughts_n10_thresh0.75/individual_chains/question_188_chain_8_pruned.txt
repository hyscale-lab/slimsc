Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, it's about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's start by recalling what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles between the edges are the same. Oh wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So that's a rhombohedral unit cell with a cubic-like structure but with angles smaller than 90 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms here. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a'. So a = 10.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ )

Wait, no, wait. Another formula comes to mind. Oh right, for a general crystal system
