Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem gives me the state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, divided by a normalization constant N. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Oh right, coherent states are Gaussian states, so their density matrices are Gaussian, I think.

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, wait, relative entropy usually measures how different two states are. But here, the formula seems a bit different. Oh, right, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated between the state and a reference Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely sure about the setup here.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. So rho = |psi><psi|.

But wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. Their overlap should be exp(-|alpha|²) or something like that. Because the inner product <alpha | beta> is exp(-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta). So for alpha and -alpha, <alpha | -alpha> would be exp(-|alpha|² - |alpha|² + (-alpha)* alpha )? Wait, no, let's compute it properly. <alpha | beta> = exp( - (|alpha|² + |beta|²)/2 + alpha* beta ). So if beta is -alpha, that's <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha)^* ). Wait, (-alpha)^* is the complex conjugate of -alpha, which is -alpha*. So alpha*(-alpha^*) is alpha
