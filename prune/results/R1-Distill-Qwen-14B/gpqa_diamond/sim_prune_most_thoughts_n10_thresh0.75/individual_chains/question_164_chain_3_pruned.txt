Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So, the question is about comparing the masses of two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods, and we have their radial velocity amplitudes.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect these companions because as they orbit, their velocities towards and away from us change, creating a sinusoidal pattern in the spectra. The amplitude of these variations depends on the mass of the other star, I think.

So, the period of the system is the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other. Both systems have their periods given: system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 of 1 year. The radial velocity amplitudes for system_1 are 10 and 5 km/s, and for system_2, 15 and 10 km/s.

I need to find the mass ratio of the two systems. Wait, no, the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So it's (mass of system_1) divided by (mass of system_2).

I think the mass of each star in a binary system can be determined using the radial velocity method. Let's recall the formula. Oh right, the formula relates the mass function, which involves the orbital period, the velocity amplitudes, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both systems are eclipsing, their orbits must be edge-on, so i is 90 degrees, meaning sin(i) is 1. That simplifies things because the mass function becomes more straightforward.

The mass function for each star is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 - eÂ²)^(3/2) ), but since the eccentricity e is probably negligible for circular orbits (as is often the case in close binaries), and since i is 90 degrees, sin(i) is 1. So the mass function simplifies.

Wait, but another approach I remember is that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, right? So if star A has velocity K_A and star B has K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B /
