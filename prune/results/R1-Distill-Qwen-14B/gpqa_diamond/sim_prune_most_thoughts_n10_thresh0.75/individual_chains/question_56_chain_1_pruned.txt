Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to determine which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules, especially for dipole transitions. The standard selection rules for the hydrogen atom (in the non-relativistic theory) are that during a dipole transition, the quantum numbers change as follows:

Δn = ±1, ±2, ... (but usually considering only allowed transitions like Δn = ±1)
Δl = ±1
Δm = 0, ±1

Wait, actually, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, but the Δn depends on the energy levels involved. Hmm, but for hydrogen, the energy depends only on n, so transitions can have Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but the dipole transitions require Δl = ±1.

So, the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So going from n=3 to n=1. That's a Δn of -2. But dipole transitions usually allow Δn=±1, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Selection rules for dipole transitions for hydrogen are that the transition is allowed if l changes by ±1, and m changes by 0 or ±1. The n can change by ±1, but for multi-photon transitions, maybe higher Δn is possible. Hmm, but the question says it's a dipole transition. Wait, but the problem mentions that it's via two dipole transitions. Oh, that's important. So maybe each step is a dipole transition, so each Δn is ±1. Because each dipole transition would change n by ±1, so two steps would change n by ±2.

Wait, let me think again. The initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital). The final state is n=1, l=0. So the first transition must go from n=3 to n=2 (since each dipole allows n change by 1). Then the second transition goes from n=2 to n=1. So that's two steps, each Δn= -1.

Now, in each step, the angular momentum quantum number l must change by ±1. So starting from l=0 in n=3, the next state after transition must have l=1 (since Δl=±1, so from 0 to 1 is allowed). Then from l=1, the next transition must go to l=0 or l=2, but since the final state has l=0, the second transition must have Δl = -1.

Wait, but the final state is l=0, so the second transition must come from l=1. So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1. The second transition is from l=1
