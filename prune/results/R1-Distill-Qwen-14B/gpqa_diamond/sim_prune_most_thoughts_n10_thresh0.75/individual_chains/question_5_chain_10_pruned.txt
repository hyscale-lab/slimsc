Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator P acting on this eigenvector gives me back the same vector multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices. Let's break that down. The X-component, P_x, is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. The matrix for P_x has first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Got it.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. That means n has components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's arbitrary, I guess the eigenvector will depend on the angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π? Wait, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is the angle around the z-axis. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, depending on the direction. So maybe we can parameterize the direction as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

But wait, actually, the direction vector can be written as (nx, nz), but in unit vector terms, it's (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ), but since in x-z plane, φ is 0. So, perhaps n is along (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more straightforward to think of the operator P as P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) · n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction of n. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n̂ will have components (nx, 0, nz), and nx² + nz² = 1.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = n · σ ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices? Because each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, each component is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. So the operator P can be written as P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), where n
