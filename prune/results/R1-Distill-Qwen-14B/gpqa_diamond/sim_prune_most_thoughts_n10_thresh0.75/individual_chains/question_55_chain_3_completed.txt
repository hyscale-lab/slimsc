Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between two types of propenyl acetates and two butenyl acetates, all either cis or trans.

First, let me try to write down the NMR data given:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of protons, and the multiplicity (like d for doublet, dq for doublet of quartets) tells me about neighboring protons.

Looking at the options, all of them are acetates with either propenyl or butenyl groups. Acetate would have an OAc group, which is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because the methyl group is attached to oxygen and deshielded but not split. So the 2.1 ppm peak, singlet with 3H, probably is the OAc methyl group. That makes sense.

Now the other signals. There are two sets: one at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16) and another at 5.5 (1H, dq). Let's think about the structure.

The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let's recall their structures.

Propenyl acetate would have an acetyloxy group (OAc) attached to a propenyl group. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc or something similar. Wait, no, the structure for propenyl acetate is actually CH2=CHCH2OAc? Or is it CH3CH=CH-OAc? Wait, no, I think propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, maybe I should draw them.

Let me think: propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, no, wait. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, but acetates are usually R-O-CO-O-R', no. Wait, no, acetates are esters, so it's R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So for propenyl acetate, it would be CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2- where one of the CH2 is double bonded. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of propenyl acetate is CH₂=CHCH₂OAc, where OAc is the acetate group (O-CO-CH3). So the propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc. Or wait, perhaps it's CH₂CH₂OAc with a double bond? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, propenyl acetate is (E)- or (Z)- 2-propenoxy acetate? Wait, no, I think propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂, but with a double bond. So the correct structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structures:

Cis vs. Trans refers to the configuration around the double bond. So whether the substituents on either end of the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

Now, the NMR signals. Let's think about each peak.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling constant, which suggests that this proton is coupled to another with which it's adjacent. Maybe a vinyl proton.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets. That's a bit more complex. Quartets suggest coupling to two different sets of protons.

The 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl group, so that's straightforward.

The 1.6 ppm is a triplet (d, doublet) with 3H. So that's a methyl group attached to something else, perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures. Let me consider propenyl and butenyl acetates.

Propenyl acetate: structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

In this structure, the CH₂=CHCH₂-O- group. The middle CH would be adjacent to the double bond. So the protons on the CH₂ groups may split into certain patterns.

Wait, but let me think about the protons on the double bond. In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc. Wait, no, that would be if it's 2-propenyl. Alternatively, the structure might be CH₂=CH-OAc attached to another CH3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂CH₂CH₂-OAc, but with a double bond. Maybe it's CH₂=CH-OAc attached to CH2? No, wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2? No, because for propenyl, the chain is three carbons, so the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

So the propenyl group is attached to the acetate. Let's imagine it's CH₂=CH-O- attached to something else. Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc. So the propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH₂-.

In that structure, the protons on the double bond would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-OAc.

Wait, but let's consider the protons on the double bond. The CH2 on either side of the double bond would have protons. So, for CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, the protons on the CH₂ adjacent to the OAc would be split how?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂CH₂-OAc with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as CH₂CH₂-OAc, but with the double bond between the first and second carbons. So, the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc.

In that case, the protons on the CH₂ adjacent to the OAc group would be split by the neighboring CH=CH.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (J=16Hz) suggests a proton that's coupled to one other proton. So perhaps it's a trans coupling between two vinyl protons.

Wait, in a double bond, each proton is coupled to the adjacent one. For example, in a trans double bond, each proton is trans to its coupling partner. So, in a structure like CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, the protons on the CH₂ would be adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂CH₂-OAc with a double bond. Let me think about the possible coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-OAc attached to a CH3. No, wait, acetate is O-CO-CH3, so the structure would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH2-O-.

In that case, the CH2 groups would have protons that are adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling, which usually comes from coupling between protons on adjacent carbons of a double bond.

In a double bond like CH₂=CH-, each CH has two protons. But in this case, perhaps it's a mono-substituted double bond. Wait, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a vinyl proton with only one adjacent proton.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each of the vinyl carbons has only one proton. Like CH₂=CH-CH₂-OAc. So the first carbon (CH₂) has two protons, the middle (CH) has one, and the third (CH2) has two. But that doesn't make sense because the middle would have two protons in CH₂=CH-CH₂.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-OAc. That would make the propenyl group as CH₂=CH-O- attached to the acetate. Wait, no, that would be allyl acetate, perhaps. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH2-OAc, which is propenyl acetate. In that structure, the CH₂ adjacent to the acetate is CH₂-OAc, and the CH2 on the end is CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16, which suggests that the proton is coupled to one other proton, perhaps from the adjacent CH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans or cis, affecting the coupling.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures for the options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So the propenyl group is cis in configuration. So, the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

Wait, but wait, in propenyl acetate, the substituents would be on the same or opposite side depending on whether it's cis or trans.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, and the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond (CH2) would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but for the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. So that's a large coupling, which often comes from coupling between two adjacent protons across a double bond.

So, for example, in a structure like CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, the middle CH would have a proton that's coupled with the adjacent CH2 protons.

Wait, but wait, the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent CH's proton.

So, the CH2 group next to the double bond (CH2) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. Let me imagine that: the CH2 group is adjacent to the CH, which is part of the double bond.

So, the CH2 group's protons would be split into a triplet because they're next to one proton (the CH). But wait, in the NMR, one of the peaks is a doublet (7.0 ppm) and another is a doublet of quartets (5.5 ppm).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure of the acetate.

Wait, another approach: The singlet at 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl group. The 1.6 ppm is a triplet. So, a triplet (d, which could be a doublet) with 3H. Wait, no, the multiplicity is 'd' for doublet. So 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet. That suggests that these three H are attached to a CH2 group which is next to a CH group.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH with one proton, so that the CH2's protons are split into a doublet. So, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, but more accurately, the 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group, which is next to a CH that has one proton. So, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something. But wait, that would be a CH(CH3) group, which has two protons on adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible structures again.

Let me list the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, butenyl is four carbons, propenyl is three.

Butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

So, for example, butenyl acetate could be CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-OAc with a double bond.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-OAc or similar.

But perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-OAc (trans) or CH3CH2CH=CH-OAc (cis?), depending on the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the main point is to look at the NMR peaks.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so it's probably a trans coupling across a double bond.

In a trans configuration, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond would be larger because they're on opposite sides. Or wait, no, wait: the coupling (J value) is influenced by the dihedral angle between the two protons. In a trans configuration, the dihedral angle is 180 degrees, which actually gives a small coupling. Wait, but in practice, when the protons are anti (trans), the coupling is smaller. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, I remember that in a double bond, the coupling between the two protons is larger when they are in a cis configuration because they are on the same side and the dihedral angle is 60 degrees, leading to a larger J value. Whereas in trans, the dihedral angle is 180, which causes the coupling to be smaller, but that's not correct because in reality, the coupling is the same regardless of configuration because the J is the same as it's based on the spatial arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The coupling constant J is determined by the spatial arrangement of the two coupled protons. For a double bond, each proton is coupled to its adjacent proton. If the two protons are on the same side (cis), the dihedral angle is 60 degrees, which leads to a larger coupling (like around 16 Hz), which is what we have here (J=16). Whereas in the trans configuration, the dihedral angle is 180 degrees, which may lead to a smaller coupling, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in reality, the coupling across a double bond is typically around 16 Hz, whether cis or trans. Because the J value is determined by the electronic environment and the spatial arrangement, but for trans, the protons are on opposite sides, so they might not be as close, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR splitting. So, in the case where the proton is part of a double bond, its coupling would be with adjacent protons.

So, let's imagine the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc (propenyl acetate, cis or trans?).

In that structure, the protons on the CH₂ next to the OAc group (let's call them CH2a) would be split by the adjacent CH (CHb) on the double bond. Now, CHb has two protons (since it's CH2=CH-), but wait no, if it's CH2=CH, that's two protons on each CH2 group. Wait, no, CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have the structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So, the CH2 groups are on either end of the double bond. So the CH2=CH- part is the propenyl group attached to the OAc.

The protons on the CH2=CH- would be as follows: the CH2 has two protons (H1 and H2), and the CH (on the other end) would have two protons (H3 and H4), but wait, no, the double bond is CH2=CH-, so the adjacent CH2 group would have two protons.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than I should. Let me think about the possible NMR signals for each option.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

In this case, the protons on the CH₂ next to the OAc (CH2a) would be adjacent to the CH group (CHb) from the double bond. So each H on CH2a would be split by the two Hs on CHb. Or wait, no, the CHb is part of the double bond, so each CH2a proton is coupled to the CHb protons.

Wait, perhaps the CH2a group is adjacent to the CHb, which has two protons. So each proton in CH2a would couple with both protons in CHb, leading to a triplet for each CH2a proton. But that's a quartet if each is coupled to two protons. Wait, but in reality, each CH2a proton would be split into a doublet of doublets or something else, depending on the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the CHb is a CH2 group, but no, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the CHb would be a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond as being adjacent to a CH group, which has one proton. So each CH2a proton would be split into a doublet, as they're only coupled to one proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), which suggests that the proton is coupled to one other proton. So perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's only coupled to one other proton on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in a double bond, each proton is coupled to two protons on the adjacent carbon if it's a CH2 group. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the CH groups has only one proton. Like in the case of a trans double bond in an ester.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of protons and their splitting.

Looking back, the 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J=16 Hz) could correspond to a proton that's coupled to a single proton elsewhere. So maybe it's a vinyl proton that's coupled to another proton on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group attached to the double bond, which has one proton. Then, that proton would be adjacent to a CH2 group, whose protons would be split into a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the protons are arranged in a way that each is only coupled to one other proton.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc with a CH3 group adjacent. No, that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 (but that's a butenyl group, not propenyl).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of peaks. The NMR has four peaks: 7.0, 5.5, 2.1, and 1.6.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a CH group. So perhaps the structure has a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. So, the 1.6 ppm is the methyl attached to a CH, which in turn is attached to another CH2.

Wait, but in that case, the CH2 group would be next to the CH(CH3), so the CH2 protons would be split into a triplet (coupled with the single proton on CH). But the NMR shows a doublet here, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, but that's a four-carbon group, which would be butenyl.

Wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl. So, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's part of a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's possible NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis).

In this structure, the CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have which protons?

The CH2=CH- group would have protons on each CH2. The CH2 adjacent to OAc (CH2-OAc) is CH2a, and the CH2 connected to the double bond is CH2b.

Wait, perhaps the CH2a (CH2-OAc) has two protons, which are split by the adjacent CH2b group's protons. Since CH2b is part of a double bond, perhaps the CH2a protons are next to a CH2b that's part of a double bond.

Wait, but in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the CH2=CH has two protons on each end. The CH2a (on the OAc side) is adjacent to the CH from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the protons on CH2a (next to OAc) are adjacent to the CH from the double bond, which has two protons. So each CH2a proton would couple with those two, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is a proton on the CH that's part of the double bond, and the 5.5 is a proton on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The CH2=CH- group has two sets of protons: the CH2 at the end (CH2a) and the CH in the middle (CHb). Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-OAc.

Wait, that would make C2 as a CH group. So, the CH on C2 would have two protons (since CH2=CH- would be on C1 and C2. So C1: CH2, C2: CH2, but wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, making C1: CH2, C2: CH, and C3: CH2-OAc.

Wait, that can't be right because if C2 is CH, then the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So C2 is CH, which has two protons. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2=CH-OAc. No, that's not correct because the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The protons on the double bond would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). So the C1: CH2, C2: CH, C3: CH2-OAc.

In that case, the protons on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the C1 (CH2) and the C3 (CH2-OAc).

So, the protons on C2 (let's say H2 and H3) would be split by the adjacent CH2 on C1 and the CH2 on C3.

But in the NMR data, we have a 1H at 7.0 ppm as a doublet, which suggests that this proton is coupled to only one other proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible structures again.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc with the substituents on the same side.

In this case, the protons on the CH2 next to the OAc (CH2-OAc) would be adjacent to the CH group (C2) which is part of the double bond.

So, the CH2-OAc group's protons would be next to the CH group. Each of these protons would be coupled with the two protons on the CH, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, which suggests more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the CH group's protons. If the CH group has two protons, and each is coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups, they would split into a quartet. But since each CH group proton is coupled to two protons on either side (from CH2 groups), this would lead to a triplet or a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the coupling for each peak.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (J=16 Hz) suggests a proton coupled to one other proton. So maybe it's a vinyl proton that's only coupled to one adjacent proton. But in a double bond, each proton is coupled to two on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the CH groups has only one proton. Like a CH group attached to the double bond, which would have one proton. So, for example, if the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's not possible because that would be a two-carbon chain. No, perhaps it's CH2=CHOAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, which would be a butenyl group, but this would have more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of peaks and their multiplicities.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H) could be a vinyl proton. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be another proton adjacent to the vinyl group.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should compare the possible structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis). So, the CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this case, the CH2 group next to the OAc (CH2-OAc) has two protons. These would be adjacent to the CH group (from CH2=CH-), which has two protons.

So, each proton in the CH2-OAc group would be coupled to the two protons on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quartets, which suggests more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group's protons are split by the adjacent CH2 groups. Each CH group proton would be coupled to two protons on each adjacent CH2, leading to a quartet or a triplet.

But the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests only one coupling. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the substituents on either end are trans.

The protons on the CH2 groups would have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the coupling constants. The J=16 Hz in the 7.0 ppm peak suggests a trans coupling across a double bond. Because in trans double bonds, the coupling is larger than in cis, due to the dihedral angle. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong earlier. Actually, the coupling constant J is larger when the dihedral angle is 60 degrees (like in cis), which allows for better coupling. In trans, the dihedral angle is 180, which leads to a smaller coupling, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, from what I recall, the coupling across a double bond (trans coupling) typically has a larger J value than cis. Because in the trans case, the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a longer-range coupling. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. I think the coupling constant J is determined by the spatial arrangement. For cis, the protons are on the same side, leading to a larger J because they're closer. Trans would have a smaller J because the protons are on opposite sides and further apart.

Wait, but I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again: The coupling constant J is inversely related to the dihedral angle. Wait, no, the dihedral angle affects the coupling. For a dihedral angle of 0 degrees (same plane), the J is maximum, and for 180 degrees (opposite), the J is minimal. So, in a trans double bond, the dihedral angle is 180, leading to a smaller J. But wait, I've read that in practice, the J for trans double bonds is around 16 Hz, which is the same as cis. Hmm, maybe the J is the same regardless of cis or trans, but the splitting pattern changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the NMR data again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling. So, perhaps it's a trans double bond, because the J is large.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in cis, the J is larger. Maybe that's correct. So if J=16 is large, it suggests cis.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to find an example.

In propene (CH2=CH2), each CH2 proton is coupled to the other, giving a triplet. The J is about 16 Hz, which is a large coupling. Wait, but in propene, the structure is CH2=CH2, so each proton is coupled to two on the other CH2, leading to a triplet. So the J is about 16 Hz, which is a large coupling.

Wait, so perhaps in this case, the J=16 Hz suggests a double bond, and the coupling is between two protons on adjacent carbons.

In the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, so the proton is coupled to one other proton. So perhaps the structure has a CH group with one proton adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. But that's a two-carbon propenyl group, which doesn't fit because propenyl is three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl). Then, the CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have the CH2 next to the OAc (CH2-OAc), which has two protons. These would be adjacent to the CH group (from CH2=CH-), which has two protons. So, each proton in CH2-OAc would be split into a triplet by the two protons on CH.

But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, which suggests more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the CH group's proton.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc (cis).

In this structure, the CH2=CH- group would have protons on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH).

The CH2 group (C1) would have two protons, each of which is adjacent to the CH group (C2) which has two protons.

So, each H in CH2 (C1) would be coupled with two Hs in CH (C2), leading to a triplet.

But the NMR data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quartets, which suggests more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group (C2) is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the OAc. So, the CH group's protons would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

Wait, perhaps the CH group's protons are split into a quartet because they're coupled to two protons on each adjacent CH2 group.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the given options and their structures again.

Another approach: The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group (since the CH2 is next to a CH with one proton, leading to a doublet).

So, perhaps the structure has a CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. But that would be a four-carbon group (butenyl), not propenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with a methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the butenyl options.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, cis.

In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The CH2 groups are on either end.

The protons on the CH2 next to the double bond would be split by the adjacent CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc (cis), which is a butenyl group.

In this structure, the CH=CH group has two CH groups, each with two protons. The CH next to the OAc would have two protons, and the CH2 would have two protons.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH next to the OAc would be split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the number of signals.

The NMR data has four peaks: 7.0 (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

So, four distinct sets of protons. Let's think about how each option would present.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have:

- CH2=CH- group: the CH2 has two H, and the CH has two H.

- CH2-OAc has two H.

Wait, but that would lead to more peaks than observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. No, that's butenyl.

Wait, another thought: the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is a large coupling. So, perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's coupled to one other proton.

But in a typical propenyl group, each CH2 has two protons, which would split into a triplet or more.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHOAc, but that's a two-carbon group, not three.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the integration.

The 7.0 ppm (1H) suggests that only one proton is present in that environment.

So, perhaps the structure has a single proton adjacent to the double bond. That would mean a CH group with one proton next to a double bond.

Wait, but propenyl groups have three carbons. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-O-CH2-OAc? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-OAc, but that's two carbons, not three.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the H on the CH group is split into a doublet because it's coupled to one H on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but the CH group has two Hs, which would each couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than I should. Another approach: the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. The 'dq' suggests a doublet of quartets, meaning it's split by two different J values.

So, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a proton that's coupled to two different groups: one with two protons and another with two protons.

Wait, maybe the 5.5 ppm is a proton on a CH group that's next to two CH2 groups. So, each H on the CH would be coupled to two Hs from each CH2, leading to a quartet for each coupling, but combined as a doublet of quartets.

The 7.0 ppm is a proton that's coupled to one other H, perhaps from a CH group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the correct answer.

The correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

But wait, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the proton on the CH group of a CH2=CH-CH2-OAc structure, which is coupled to one H on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the CH group (C2) has two Hs. Each H on C2 would be coupled to the two Hs on C1 (CH2) and the two Hs on C3 (CH2-OAc). So, each H on C2 would be split into a triplet (coupled with two Hs on C1), but perhaps this leads to a quartet if coupled with C3's Hs.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the H on C3 (CH2-OAc), but that doesn't make sense because they're next to a CH2 group, which would split them into a triplet.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to make a table of the possible structures and their NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc. The CH₂=CH-CH₂-OAc.

The protons on the CH₂ next to OAc (C3) would be adjacent to the CH group (C2), which has two Hs.

So, each H on C3 would be split by C2's two Hs, leading to a triplet.

The Hs on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to C1 (CH₂) and C3 (CH₂).

So each H on C2 would be coupled to two Hs on C1 and two Hs on C3, leading to a quartet.

The Hs on C1 (CH₂) would be adjacent to C2's CH, which has two Hs, so each H on C1 would be split into a triplet.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- C3 (CH₂-OAc): triplet at around 4.5 ppm (but data shows 5.5, which is higher).

- C2 (CH): quartet at around 5.5 ppm, which matches the data.

- C1 (CH₂): triplet at around 3.0 ppm or so, but the data shows nothing in that region.

Wait, but the data shows 7.0 ppm as a doublet. That doesn't fit. So perhaps this isn't the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think about the 1.6 ppm (3H, d). If it's a methyl attached to a CH₂, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. That would be a four-carbon group, making it butenyl.

In that case, the CH(CH3) group would have a methyl attached, and the CH would be adjacent to the double bond.

So, the CH(CH3) would have Hs that are split by the adjacent CH₂ groups.

The methyl group (CH3) attached to CH would be a doublet because it's next to a CH with one H.

In this case, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) would correspond to the methyl group on CH(CH3), which is adjacent to a CH with one H, leading to a doublet.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) would be the H on the CH adjacent to the double bond, which is coupled with the two Hs on the double bond's CH₂ and perhaps another group.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) would be a H on the double bond's CH₂, coupled to another H on the adjacent CH.

But wait, this would be a butenyl group, which would make the correct option either A or D.

But the options are between propenyl and butenyl. So if the structure is butenyl, then the correct option would be A or D.

The NMR data has four peaks, which would make sense for a butenyl group.

In that case, the 7.0 ppm would be a proton on the double bond's CH₂, coupled to another proton, leading to a doublet. The 5.5 ppm would be the CH group's proton, coupled to two groups, leading to a dq.

The 1.6 ppm is the methyl on the CH(CH3), which is a doublet.

So, putting it all together, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, which is a butenyl group, specifically trans or cis.

Wait, but the options are Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, Trans-butenyl.

So, perhaps the correct structure is butenyl, either cis or trans.

But the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which would suggest a trans configuration, as the coupling is larger.

Wait, but earlier I thought that cis would have a larger J. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

But I'm not finding a clear path. Another approach: the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. So, perhaps it's a proton that's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups.

In a cis structure, the coupling would be larger, leading to a larger J. Since the 7.0 ppm has J=16, which is large, perhaps it's a cis configuration.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

1H NMR (ppm):  
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)  
- 5.5 (1H, dq)  
- 2.1 (3H, s)  
- 1.6 (3H, d)  

### Key Analysis:
1. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**  
   This is a singlet for a methyl group attached to an oxygen atom, likely the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) functional group.

2. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**  
   This is a doublet for a methyl group (3H) attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a CH2 group. This suggests the presence of a CH(CH3) group in the structure.

3. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**  
   This is a doublet of quartets, indicating a proton coupled to two distinct sets of protons. This is consistent with a proton on a CH group adjacent to two different CH2 groups.

4. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**  
   This is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), which is characteristic of a proton on a double bond coupled to another proton on an adjacent carbon. The large J value suggests a trans configuration across the double bond.

### Structural Considerations:
- **Propenyl Acetate:**  
   The structure of propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In this case, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The CH2 group adjacent to the OAc group would produce a triplet due to coupling with the CH group, but the NMR data does not match this pattern.

- **Butenyl Acetate:**  
   The structure of butenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The double bond is between the first and second carbons. The CH2 groups on either side of the double bond would produce splitting patterns consistent with the NMR data. The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the methyl group on the CH(CH3) group, and the 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets corresponds to the CH group adjacent to the double bond.

- **Cis vs. Trans Configuration:**  
   The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) at 7.0 ppm is consistent with a trans configuration across the double bond. This eliminates the cis isomers from consideration.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data matches the structure of **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it explains all the observed peaks and splitting patterns. The large J value at 7.0 ppm confirms the trans configuration.
