Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me think. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each a different fraction of the speed of light.

First, I should remember what happens in annihilation. When a proton and antiproton annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, typically producing other particles. But in this case, it's producing two particles of each A⁺ and A⁻. So the products are four particles in total, two positive and two negative A particles.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Let's think about their masses. The proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton is the same. So the total rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV/c². The products are four A particles, each 300 MeV/c². So 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV/c². Hmm, that's less than the initial rest mass.

Wait, but that can't be right because in annihilation, the energy comes from the rest mass. Wait, but maybe since the initial particles are moving, or perhaps the setup is different. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, but in that case, the initial kinetic energy would be low, but that might complicate things.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says the antiproton is slowly moving. So the proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some slow velocity. Oh wait, but protons and antiprotons annihilate when they meet, but in this scenario, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe it's in a scenario where their combined energy is just enough to produce the A particles.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about it step by step.

The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some
