Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. Compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what Compound X was.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Birch reduction. Or wait, Birch reduction uses that? Or maybe it's a ring-opening agent. Alternatively, another thought: I remember that some cyclic amines can be used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh, right! Epoxides can react with amines in ring-opening reactions, especially under certain conditions. So if Compound X is an epoxide, reacting it with a diamine like this might lead to some ring opening. But wait, the product's NMR data might help us figure that out.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s) - probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl.
δ 2.31 (3H, s) - another methyl, perhaps in a similar environment.
δ 6.75 (1H, d) - aromatic proton, perhaps part of a coupling.
Then δ7.08 (2H, d), δ7.68 (1H, d), δ7.71 (2H, d). That seems like a pattern from a substituted benzene ring, maybe with two doublets and a triplet? Or maybe it's a para-substituted ring with some coupling.

Wait, maybe it's a styrene structure or something similar. Styrene has two doublets in its NMR because of the trans coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with substituents in specific positions.

13C NMR:
δ21.3 (s) - a carbon attached to something electronegative? Maybe a methyl adjacent to
