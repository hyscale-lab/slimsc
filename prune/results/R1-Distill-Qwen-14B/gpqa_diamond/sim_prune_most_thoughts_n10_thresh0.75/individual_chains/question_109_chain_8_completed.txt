Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle and determining which partial wave isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. So, the initial state is 1S0. Then they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, we need to find out what the possible states are after emission and see which partial wave isn't permitted.

Wait, the problem gives options where each option represents a transition from the initial state 1S0 to a different state plus a particle (p, f, s, etc.), and we have to pick the one that's not allowed.

Let me recall the conservation laws. Both angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So, the total angular momentum and parity of the initial state should equal the total after emission.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The notation is (2S+1)LJ. So, 1S0 would mean S=0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0), L=0 (since S is for spin, and in spectroscopic notation, the L comes next as S, P, D, etc. So S is L=0?), wait no, wait. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0: the first number is 2S+1=1 → S=0. The next is the letter, which is S, meaning L=0 (since S is 0 in orbital terms). Then the third part is J, which is 0.

So initial state: S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and after emitting X, the final NN state has T=0. Oh, but the Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, so for the final state, T is 0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That implies S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

Wait, what about the emitted X? X has intrinsic parity -1. So I need to consider how parity is affected.

The initial parity is for the NN system. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. Since L is 0 here, the initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

After emission, the final state's parity must be the same as initial. The parity of the final NN system plus the parity of X must equal the initial parity? Or is it that the parity of the process (NN → NN' + X) must conserve parity.

Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the parity of the initial state is P_initial = parity of NN (initial) = (+1) because L=0.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of NN' and X. So P_final = (parity of NN') * (parity of X).

But parity must be conserved, so P_initial = P_final.

Parity of X is given as -1. So,

Parity of NN' must be P_NN' = P_initial / P_X = (+1) / (-1) = -1.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

So (-1)^{L'} = -1 → L' must be odd. So L' is 1,3,5... etc.

Now, the final NN state has T=0. From the Pauli condition: T = S + L + 1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd.

So, S and L must be such that S + L is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

But wait, S is the total spin, which for two nucleons... Well, nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, so their combined spin can be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet).

But in the initial state, the spin is S=0. But after emission, the final state's spin could be different. Hmm, but I'm not sure how the spin is connected here. The question says the final NN state has T=0, but what about its spin? Let me think.

Wait, the Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T, S, L here are the quantum numbers of the NN system after emission.

So, for the final state: T' = 0, and 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → S' + L' = 1 mod 2.

So, the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must be odd.

Additionally, the orbital angular momentum L' must be odd because the parity of the NN' state is -1, so L' is odd.

So, if L' is odd, then S' must be even (since S' + L' is odd → if L' is odd, S' must be even (because even + odd = odd)). Because S' is spin, possible values are 0, 1, 2,... But for two spin-1/2 particles, S' can be 0 or 1.

So S' must be even → S'=0 (since 1 is odd, 0 is even). So, the final NN state must have S'=0.

So, the final state has S=0, L' is odd, T'=0.

Now, looking at the options, each option shows the transition to a new state, which includes the angular momentum state of X.

Wait, the options are of the form 1S0 → something + particle. So, for each option, the something is the final NN state.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. After emitting X, the NN goes to a new state. Let's say the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. The emitted X has angular momentum l (denoted by the lowercase letter, like s for l=0, p for l=1, d=2, f=3, etc.). So the emitted X has angular momentum l.

So, for each option, the emitted particle's l is given. The options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p → X is p (l=1)
B) 1S0 →3S1 + p → X is p (l=1)
C) 1S0 →3D3 + f → X is f (l=3)
D) 1S0 →3P0 + s → X is s (l=0)

Wait, no, the + p, + f, etc. denote the particle emitted. So X is a p (which is a π meson?), but for the purposes of angular momentum, X has orbital angular momentum l corresponding to s, p, d, f.

Wait, but in the options, the letters after the plus signs denote the type of particle, but the actual angular momentum is given by the lowercase letters (s, p, d, f) which correspond to l=0,1,2,3.

Wait, so for each option, the state after emission is written as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse these.

The state is written as (2S'+1)L'J'. So for each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p. So the NN state is 7D1. So 7 is 2S'+1 → S'=3. D is L'=2 (since S is 0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc.). So L'=2. J' is 1.

So, for this option, final S' is 3, L'=2, J'=1.

But wait, earlier conclusion was that S' must be 0. So this can't be correct. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The Pauli condition is that T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2. So, T' is 0. So S' + L' must be 1 mod 2. So, if S' is 3 (so odd), and L' is 2 (even), then S' + L' is odd (3+2=5 mod2=1). So that's okay. Also, L' must be odd, but here L' is 2 (even). But earlier, from parity, L' must be odd because the parity is -1.

Wait! That's a contradiction.

So, for the final state, L' must be odd because parity is (-1)^L' = -1.

In option A, the final state is 7D1, which is L'=2. So even L' → parity would be +1, but it needs to be -1. So option A is invalid because L' is even. So option A would violate parity conservation. So it's not allowed.

But let me check the other options as well.

Option B: 3S1 + p. So the NN state is 3S1. So 3=2S'+1 → S'=1. S is L'=0. J'=1.

So, L'=0. So parity would be (+1)^0 = +1, but we need it to be -1, so this can't be.

Wait, but then parity is conserved? So option B's final state has L'=0, which would give parity +1. But the initial parity is +1, X has parity -1. So the product of the final NN state's parity and X's parity should be +1. So P_NN' * P_X = (+1) * (-1) = -1, which doesn't equal the initial parity of +1. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, I think I got the parity conservation wrong. The parity of the initial NN state is +1. After emission, the parity is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X. So,

P_initial = P_NN' * P_X.

P_initial is +1, P_X is -1. So,

+1 = P_NN' * (-1) → P_NN' = -1.

Which implies that the parity of the NN' state is -1, so (-1)^L' = -1 → L' must be odd.

So for each option, the final state's L' must be odd. Let's check each option.

Option A: L' =2 (D is L=2). So L' is even. So parity of NN' is +1. So P_initial = (+1) * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial parity +1. So option A is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L'=0. So parity of NN' is +1. Same problem as A. So P_initial would be (-1), which isn't correct. So B is invalid.

Option C: 3D3 → L'=2 (D is 2). Wait, D is 2. So L' is 2 (even). Again parity would be +1. So again, P_NN' is +1, X is -1. So product is -1. Doesn't match initial +1. So C is invalid.

Wait, but option C's state is 3D3. Let me double-check. 3 is 2S+1=3 → S=1. D is L'=2. So parity would be (-1)^2=+1 → which is no good. So option C is invalid.

Option D: 3P0 → L'=1 (P is 1). So parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So P_NN' * P_X = (-1) * (-1) = +1, which matches the initial parity. So option D satisfies this.

Now, let's check the Pauli condition for each option that hasn't been ruled out yet.

Only option D remains, but let me recheck all.

Wait, perhaps I should also check the Pauli condition for each of the options.

The Pauli condition is T' = S' + L' +1 mod 2.

In option D:

The final state is 3P0. So (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L' is P →1. So S' =1 (odd), L'=1 (odd). So S' + L' = 2 → even. So 1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. So T' = 0 +1 → 0 = (1 +1) +1 mod2 → 0=2+1 mod2 → 3 mod2=1. Wait, 3 mod2 is 1, but T' is given as 0. That doesn't match.

Wait, wait. The Pauli condition is T'=S' + L' + 1 mod2. So for option D:

S' = 1, L' =1. So S' + L' = 2 → 0 mod2. Then T' = 0 +1 mod2 → 1. But T' is given as 0. So this is a conflict. So option D would have T'=1, which doesn't match the given T'=0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought option D has L'=1 (which is correct) and P_NN' is -1. But let me recheck the Pauli condition.

Wait, the correct condition is T' = S' + L' + 1 mod2. So for option D:

S' is 1, L' is1. So S' + L' = 2 → 0 mod2. Add 1: 0 +1 =1 mod2. So T' would be 1, but the question says the final state has T'=0. So this is not allowed. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but I thought option D's parity was correct. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find an option where both parity is correct and the Pauli condition holds.

Wait, let me go back and re-express the problem.

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the final NN state is, say, (2S'+1)L'J', and the particle X has angular momentum l.

Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum before and after must be the same. However, since the emitted particle has its own angular momentum, I think the initial J is 0, so the sum of the final NN's J' and X's l must be 0 modulo angular momentum. So J' = l, since the initial J is 0, and angular momentum is conserved. Wait, no, because the initial state's J is 0, so the vector sum of J' and l must be 0. So J' and l must combine to 0. So J' must equal l, and their vector sum is zero? That's only possible if J'=0 and l=0, but that's only possible if J'=0 and l=0. But wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because when you have two angular momenta adding up to zero, you have J' = l, and J' and l must have opposite directions. But for their sum to be zero, J' must equal l, and their magnitudes are equal. So J' = l. Because J' and l are vectors, their sum is zero only if they have the same magnitude and opposite directions, but since they are quantum numbers, we can't have negative angular momentum. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of addition of angular momenta. The initial angular momentum is J=0. After emission, the final NN has J' and X has l. So the total angular momentum is J' + l. But initial J is 0, so J' + l must also be zero. But since angular momentum is a vector, this can only happen if J' = l and they are in opposite directions. But quantum mechanically, this is only possible if J' = l and their vector sum is zero. But for the purposes of selection, perhaps the only possibility is that J' = l, and their sum is zero in magnitude. So J' must equal l, and the only way for that to happen is if J' = l and the coupling leads to a total angular momentum of zero. But that might not be possible except when J'=l=0.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (the 'l' value) must match L' of the final NN state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for the option where the final state satisfies both the parity condition and the Pauli condition.

So let's re-express all options.

Option A: 7D1 +p → NN state is 7D1. So S'=3, L'=2, J'=1.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^2 = +1. Which would give P_initial = P_NN' * P_X → +1 = (+1)*(-1) → +1 = -1 → no, this is wrong. So option A is invalid.

Option B: 3S1 +p → NN state is 3S1. S'=1, L'=0, J'=1.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^0=+1. So P_initial=+1 = (+1)*(-1)= -1 → invalid.

Option C:3D3 +f → NN state is 3D3. S'=1, L'=2, J'=3.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^2=+1. So P_initial=+1 = (+1)*(-1)= -1 → invalid.

Option D:3P0 +s → NN state is 3P0. S'=1, L'=1, J'=0.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^1 =-1. So P_initial=+1 = (-1)*(-1)=+1 → valid. So parity is okay.

Now, Pauli condition for option D: T'=0. So T' = S' + L' +1 mod2.

S' is 1, L' is1. So 1 +1 +1 =3 → 1 mod2. So T' would be 1. But the question says T'=0. So this doesn't hold. So option D is invalid.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the initial state has T= something, but the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So the Pauli condition applies to the final state.

In option D, the Pauli condition gives T'=1, but the question says T'=0. So option D is invalid.

So, all options except perhaps B and C are invalid. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the Pauli condition. The condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So T = S + L +1 mod2.

So for the final state:

T' = (S' + L' +1) mod2.

We need T' =0.

So 0 = (S' + L' +1) mod2 → S' + L' +1 ≡0 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So, S' + L' must be 1 mod2.

Now, in option D, S' is1, L' is1. So 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So 0 +1=1 → T' would be 1. So no, option D's T' is 1, which doesn't match the given T'=0.

So none of the options seem to satisfy both parity and Pauli conditions. That can't be right. So perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option's final state has L' odd and S' even, because S' + L' must be odd.

Because S' + L' must be 1 mod2 (since T' = (S' + L' +1) mod2 =0 → S' + L' =1 mod2).

So S' and L' must be such that their sum is odd.

So for each option, let's compute S' + L' mod2.

Option A: S'=3 (odd), L'=2 (even). 3+2=5 →1 mod2. So sum is 1 → T'= (1 +1) mod2= 0. Because T' = sum +1 mod2.

Wait, no. T' is (sum) +1 mod2 → sum is 1, so 1 +1=2 →0 mod2. So T' is 0. So option A's T' is 0, which is correct.

But earlier, I thought option A's L' is even, which would make the parity of the NN' state +1, which would make P_initial = (+1)*(-1)=-1, which is wrong. So option A is invalid because parity isn't conserved.

But wait, the parity for option A is L'=2 → parity of NN' is +1. So P_initial = +1 = (+1)*(-1) → -1, which is incorrect. So option A is invalid.

Option B: S'=1 (odd), L'=0 (even). 1+0=1 → sum is 1 → T'= (1 +1)=2 → 0 mod2. So T' is 0, which is correct.

But parity is L'=0 → NN' parity is +1. So P_initial = (+1)*(-1) =-1 → wrong.

Option C: S'=1 (odd), L'=2 (even). Sum is 1+2=3 →1 mod2. T'= (1+1) mod2=0. So T' is correct.

But L'=2 → parity is +1. So P_initial = (+1)*(-1)= -1 → wrong.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1. Sum is 2 →0 mod2. T'=(0+1)=1 → not 0. So T' is wrong.

So none of the options have both parity correct and T'=0.

Wait, this can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition applies to the initial state. No, the question says that the final state's quantum numbers must satisfy the condition.

Wait, the question says: "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

So the condition is about the final state, not the initial.

So let's re-examine.

In option D: T'= (S' + L' +1) mod2 → (1 +1 +1)=3 →1. So T'=1, which doesn't match the given T'=0.

So option D is invalid.

Now, the only option left is option B.

Wait, no, all options have T' that may not match except perhaps none. But that can't be, as the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the Pauli condition. Maybe the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2, but perhaps S and L are the initial state's values. But no, the question says it's for the final state.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let's think about each option and see whether it's allowed.

Starting with option D: 3P0 +s.

So, the emitted particle is s (l=0). The initial state has J=0. So after emission, the final NN state has J' and the particle has l=0. So J' must be 0, because J_initial=0. So J' =0.

In the final NN state, J' is 0, which is given as 3P0 → J'=0.

So, the total angular momentum is conserved because J_initial=0 = J' + l → 0 =0 +0 → correct.

Parity of NN' is (-1)^1 = -1. X's parity is -1. Initial parity is +1. So product is (-1)*(-1)=1 → correct.

Pauli condition: T'=0. So,

T' = (S' + L' +1) mod2.

S'=1, L'=1. So 1+1+1=3 →1 mod2. So T'=1, which doesn't match. So option D is invalid.

Now, option B: 3S1 +p.

L'=0 → parity of NN' is +1. So ( +1 ) * (-1) = -1 → not equal to initial parity +1. So option B is invalid.

Option A:7D1 +p → L'=2 → parity +1. So again, product is -1. Invalid.

Option C:3D3 +f.

L'=2 → parity +1. So product is -1. Invalid.

So all options are invalid except for none.

Wait, that's impossible, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the emitted X is in an s-wave, which has l=0. So when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum change is l. So the initial orbital angular momentum is L=0. The final orbital angular momentum is L' = l. Because when a particle is emitted with orbital angular momentum l, the change in the system's orbital angular momentum is L' = L - l. Wait, no, that's not correct. The total orbital angular momentum after emission would involve the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle and the remaining system. But perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, so the initial NN system had L=0, and after emission, the NN system has L'=L - l → but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is part of the final state, but perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is L', and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l. So the total orbital angular momentum is L' + l. But initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so L' + l must be 0. But that's impossible unless L' = -l, which isn't possible since angular momentum is non-negative. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is L' = l.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is the same as the initial, but that's not correct because the emission would involve the creation of orbital angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN system's orbital angular momentum after emission is L'. Then, the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l. But initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so L' + l must be 0. Which implies L' = -l. But since angular momentum is quantized and non-negative, the only possibility is L'=l=0. So the only allowed transition is when l=0, and L'=0. But this would imply that the emitted particle must have l=0, which is an s-wave.

But wait, that would mean that only option D is possible (since X is s, l=0), but in option D, the Pauli condition is not satisfied.

This suggests that the only allowed option is when the emitted particle has l=0. So, which option has X as s (l=0)?

Only option D: 3P0 +s.

But in that case, let's recheck:

L'=1 (P state). So parity is (-1)^1 =-1. So product is (-1)*(-1)=+1 → correct.

Pauli condition: T'=0.

So T' = S' + L' +1 mod2.

In option D, S'=1, L'=1.

So 1 +1 +1 =3 →1 mod2. So T'=1, but it needs to be 0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should think about each option's allowedness.

Let me try a different approach. Let's see which options have L' odd and S' even, because S' + L' must be odd.

Looking for S' even and L' odd.

Option A: S'=3 (odd), L'=2 (even). No.

Option B: S'=1 (odd), L'=0 (even). No.

Option C: S'=1 (odd), L'=2 (even). No.

Option D: S'=1 (odd), L'=1 (odd). So S' + L' =2 → even. So doesn't satisfy S' + L' being odd. So option D doesn't satisfy.

Hmm, so none of the options have S' even and L' odd. So that's a problem.

Wait, but what if the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is considered. So the initial NN system has L=0. After emission, the NN system has L' and the emitted X has l. So, perhaps the initial orbital angular momentum is 0, so the total after emission must also be 0. So L' + l =0 → which is only possible if L'=l=0. So the only allowed transition is when l=0 and L'=0. But then, the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^0=+1. So P_initial = (+1)*(-1) =-1 → which doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So that's impossible.

This suggests that none of the options are allowed, but that can't be right.

I'm clearly getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

Emitted X has parity -1.

Final state must have parity NN' * X = initial parity → NN' parity must be -1 → L' is odd.

Pauli condition for final state: T'=0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → S' + L' must be 1 mod2.

So S' + L' is odd.

Now, the final state's S' and L' must satisfy:

S' is 0 or 1 (since two spin-1/2 particles can have S'=0 or 1).

L' must be odd (1,3,5...).

So possible combinations:

If S'=0 (even), L' must be odd → sum is odd → satisfies condition.

If S'=1 (odd), L' must be even → sum is odd → satisfies condition.

But L' must be odd, so the only valid cases are when S'=0 and L' is odd, or S'=1 and L' is even (but L' must be odd, so this is not possible).

Wait, no. Wait, S' + L' must be odd.

If L' is odd:

If S' is even (0), then 0 + odd = odd → condition satisfied.

If S' is odd (1), then 1 + odd = even → doesn't satisfy.

So the only possible case is S'=0 and L' odd.

So the final state must have S'=0, L' odd.

Now, let's see which options have S'=0 and L' odd.

Looking at each option:

Option A:7D1 → S'=3 → no.

Option B:3S1 → S'=1 → no.

Option C:3D3 → S'=1 → no.

Option D:3P0 → S'=1 → no.

Wait, none of the options have S'=0. So does that mean none of the options are possible? But the question says one isn't permitted, implying that all except one are permitted.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me recheck the condition.

The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the condition. Maybe it's T = S + L +1 mod2, but perhaps S and L are the initial state's quantum numbers. No, the question says the condition applies to the final state.

So, the conclusion is that for the final state, S' + L' must be 1 mod2.

And L' must be odd.

So, S' can be 0 (even) → 0 + odd = odd → condition satisfied.

Or S' can be 1 (odd) and L' even → 1 + even = odd → condition satisfied.

Wait, but L' must be odd, so the only possibility is S'=0 and L' odd.

So, the final state must have S'=0 and L' odd.

Now, let's check which options have S'=0 and L' odd.

Looking at the options:

Option A:7D1 → S'=3 → no.

Option B:3S1 → S'=1 → no.

Option C:3D3 → S'=1 → no.

Option D:3P0 → S'=1 → no.

None of the options have S'=0. So that suggests that none are allowed. But the question says one is not permitted, implying that others are allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-express the options to find their S' and L'.

Option A:7D1 → 2S'+1=7 → S'=3. L'=2 (D is 2). So S' is odd, L' even.

So for option A, S' + L' =3+2=5 → 1 mod2. So condition T'=0 is satisfied.

But L' is even → parity of NN' is +1 → leads to P_initial = +1 = (+1)*(-1) →-1 → invalid.

Option B:3S1 → S'=1, L'=0.

S' + L' =1 → condition holds. T'=0.

But L'=0 → parity of NN' is +1 → P_initial = +1 = (+1)*(-1) →-1 → invalid.

Option C:3D3 →S'=1, L'=2.

S' + L' =3 →1 mod2. Condition holds.

L'=2 → parity of NN' is +1 → P_initial =-1 → invalid.

Option D:3P0 → S'=1, L'=1.

S' + L'=2 →0 mod2. So condition T' =0 → (0 +1) mod2 →1. So condition not satisfied.

But parity is correct.

So, none of the options satisfy both parity and Pauli conditions. So perhaps the only option that satisfies parity is option D, but it doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition. So it's invalid.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the wave that's not allowed is the one that doesn't satisfy either parity or the Pauli condition.

But all options have parity wrong except option D. So option D's parity is correct, but Pauli condition is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which partial wave isn't permitted. So perhaps the partial wave is the emitted particle's l.

In option D, the emitted particle is s, which is l=0.

So, for the emitted particle, the orbital angular momentum is l.

In the initial state, the NN system has L=0. After emission, the NN system has L'=1, and the emitted X has l=0.

So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l =1 +0=1. But initial L is 0, so that's a problem because angular momentum isn't conserved.

Wait, but angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial system has L=0, and after emission, the total L of the system (NN' and X) must be 0. So L' + l must be 0. Which is only possible if L'=l=0. So the emitted particle must have l=0, and the NN' system has L'=0. So option D has X as s (l=0) and NN' state with L'=1. So this violates angular momentum conservation, making option D impossible.

Wait, but that can't be because option D's NN' state has L'=1, but X has l=0. So total L' + l=1≠0 → invalid.

So, in that case, option D's transition is impossible due to angular momentum conservation, not parity or Pauli condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought that angular momentum conservation requires that the sum of the final states' angular momenta equals the initial. So J_initial=0, so J' (NN') and l (X) must add up to 0. So J' = l and their directions are opposite, but in quantum terms, it's only possible if J'=l and the sum is zero, which only occurs when J'=0 and l=0.

So the only allowed transition is when X has l=0, and the NN' state has J'=0. So let's see which options meet this.

Option D: X is s (l=0), and the NN state is 3P0 → J'=0. So J' =0, l=0 → sum is 0. So angular momentum is conserved.

Parity: NN' has L'=1 → parity is -1. X has parity -1. So P_initial = (+1) = (-1)*(-1)=+1 → correct.

Pauli condition: T'=0.

So, S'=1, L'=1.

T' = (1 +1 +1) mod2 =3 mod2=1 → T'=1≠0. So Pauli condition not satisfied.

So, even though options D satisfies angular momentum and parity, it fails the Pauli condition, making it invalid.

So, which option is invalid because it doesn't satisfy parity?

Looking back, all options except D have L' even, leading to NN' parity of +1, which makes P_initial = -1, which is incorrect.

So, the only option that satisfies parity is option D, but it fails the Pauli condition. So the others fail parity, making them invalid.

So, the question is which partial wave (emitted X's l) is not permitted. The invalid ones are those that don't satisfy parity.

So, the allowed partial wave is only s (l=0), which is option D. But option D is invalid because of the Pauli condition. So the other options have l=1 and l=3, which make parity wrong, so they're invalid.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the permitted partial waves are those that satisfy both parity and angular momentum conservation, but also the Pauli condition.

So, the only possible allowed partial wave would be s (l=0), but in option D, Pauli condition is violated.

So, all options are invalid except perhaps none.

But the question says one is not permitted. So perhaps the answer is option A, because L' is even, making parity invalid.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for the option where the emitted particle's l is such that L' can't be odd, making parity invalid.

Wait, but the correct way is to find which option doesn't satisfy the conservation of parity.

So, options A, B, and C have L' even, making NN' parity +1. So their product would be -1, which doesn't match initial parity +1. So these are invalid.

Option D has L'=1 (parity -1), so product is +1 → correct. But Pauli condition fails.

So the only allowed partial wave is s (l=0), but it's invalid due to Pauli condition.

Therefore, all options are invalid except perhaps none, but the question expects one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has L'=2, making parity invalid. So the partial wave p is not permitted.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The permitted partial waves are those that don't violate parity and other conditions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which option's emitted particle's l makes L' impossible to be odd. For example, if the emitted particle's l is even, then L' would have to be even minus the emitted l, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's l must be even, making L' even. But this isn't helpful.

Another approach: The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', and the emitted X has parity (-1)^l. Initial parity is (-1)^0=+1.

So, parity conservation: (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^l = (+1).

Which implies (-1)^{L' + l} =1 → L' + l must be even.

So, L' + l is even.

In each option, X's l is given by the suffix:

A) p → l=1.

B) p → l=1.

C) f → l=3.

D) s → l=0.

So for each option:

A) L'=2. So 2 +1=3 → odd → parity conservation fails. So option A invalid.

B) L'=0. 0 +1=1 → odd → parity invalid.

C) L'=2. 2 +3=5 → odd → parity invalid.

D) L'=1. 1 +0=1 → odd → parity invalid.

Wait, this can't be right. Because for parity conservation, L' + l must be even. So all options have L' + l odd, which means all would violate parity conservation.

But that's impossible because the question says one option is invalid.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something. Let me conclude.

The correct approach is to find which option violates either parity conservation or the Pauli condition.

From earlier analysis, the only option that satisfies parity conservation is option D. But it fails the Pauli condition. The others fail parity.

So, the partial wave that's not permitted is the one where parity is violated, which are options A, B, and C.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted, implying it's one of the options. Since all except D are invalid due to parity, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the answer in the options is not clear. Perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it has L'=2, leading to parity violation.

After going through all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p is not permitted because it violates parity.


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in a 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The goal is to determine which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws and the Pauli condition. The initial state is 1S0, meaning \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). After emission, the final NN state has \( T = 0 \), and the Pauli condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must be satisfied. Additionally, parity conservation requires that the parity of the initial state equals the product of the parities of the final NN state and the emitted particle X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:
   - The initial parity is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).
   - After emission, the parity of the system is given by \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \). Since \( P_X = -1 \), the parity of the final NN state must be \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \), implying \( L' \) (the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state) must be odd.

2. **Pauli Condition**:
   - For the final state, \( T = 0 \), so \( 0 = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). This simplifies to \( S' + L' = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), meaning \( S' \) and \( L' \) must be of opposite parity.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:
   - The initial angular momentum is \( J = 0 \). After emission, the total angular momentum of the system (NN' and X) must also be zero. This implies \( J' = l \), where \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S' = 3 \) (odd), \( L' = 2 \) (even).  
     - Parity of NN': \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^2 = +1 \).  
     - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates the initial parity \( +1 \).  
     - Conclusion: Invalid due to parity violation.

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 0 \) (even).  
     - Parity of NN': \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^0 = +1 \).  
     - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates the initial parity \( +1 \).  
     - Conclusion: Invalid due to parity violation.

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 2 \) (even).  
     - Parity of NN': \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^2 = +1 \).  
     - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which violates the initial parity \( +1 \).  
     - Conclusion: Invalid due to parity violation.

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S' = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 1 \) (odd).  
     - Parity of NN': \( (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^1 = -1 \).  
     - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (-1) \cdot (-1) = +1 \), which satisfies the initial parity \( +1 \).  
     - Pauli condition: \( T' = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) = 1 \), which does not match \( T' = 0 \).  
     - Conclusion: Invalid due to Pauli condition violation.

### Final Answer:
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option A**, as it violates parity conservation.  
Answer: A
