Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to choose the correct option from the given choices (A to D) which match the products.

Let's tackle the first reaction first: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, what's happening here? t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking about elimination reactions, maybe an E2 mechanism. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, cyclohexanone derivative. So maybe it's a Claisen or similar condensation? Or maybe it's a Michael addition? Alternatively, since we're using a base, perhaps an enolate is involved. 

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So when enolates react with such compounds, it's typically an example of conjugate addition, like the Michael addition. So, in this scenario, the enolate of the cyclohexanone would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So let me think: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The ketone is at position 1. The positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with substituents at C1 (carbonyl), C2 (ethyl and methyl), and C6 (methyl). 

When a base like t-BuOK is present, it would deprotonate the alpha position to form an enolate. The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl group, so C2 and C3 (since the cyclohexanone is at C1). Wait, the cyclohexanone is at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. Wait, but the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the positions are:

- C1: carb
