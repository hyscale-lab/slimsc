Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is moving through a glass with refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame, right? So we need to find the observer's measured speed of the light beam.

I remember that when dealing with objects moving at high speeds, special relativity comes into play. But wait, v is the velocity of the glass. I don't know how big v is. The problem says "constant velocity v", so maybe it's not too close to the speed of light, but I can't be sure. So perhaps we need to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? Since in vacuum it's c, so in the glass it's slower by a factor of n. So normally, if the glass were stationary, the speed would be c/n. But the glass is moving, so the observer would see a different speed.

This seems like a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula! Because the glass is moving, and the light is moving within it, so we have to find the combined effect.

Wait, but how exactly does this work? So in the glass's frame of reference, the light is moving at c/n relative to the glass. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

I think the formula for transforming velocities between frames is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), but wait, what's u in this case? Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is u = c/n, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity is the sum of the glass's velocity and
