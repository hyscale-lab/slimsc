Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And the pion is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what's nu here? Oh right, in particle physics, nu usually refers to a neutrino, so probably a muon neutrino in this case, but I don't think its mass is significant here because neutrinos are super light, almost massless compared to the other particles involved.

So, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, we can use conservation of energy and momentum to find the energies of the products. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Oh right, so their momenta are equal and opposite.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino's energy is much smaller because its mass is negligible. So most of the energy goes to the muon, I think.

Wait, but then again, the muon has its own rest mass. So the total energy of the muon must be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is almost zero.

Let me write down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation:
E_pion = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation:
p_pion = p_mu + p_nu

But since the pion is at rest, p_pion is zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu = p.

So, I can write:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units might complicate things. Let me think in terms of MeV. Since all masses are given in MeV/c², and energy in Me
