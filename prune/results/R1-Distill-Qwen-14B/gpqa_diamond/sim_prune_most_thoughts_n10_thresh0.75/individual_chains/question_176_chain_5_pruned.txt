Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and the components are complex numbers, but here the components are real. Oh, I guess that's okay. So the state vector is |-1; 2; 1>. But wait, I should check if this is normalized. The norm would be the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2, which is 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, but when measuring observables, we usually normalize the state. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's normalized? Wait, maybe I should proceed and see if it matters.

The problem talks about two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down as I understand it. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So the P matrix is:

[ 0       1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2 ]
[ 0       1/√2     0     ]

And the Q matrix is another 3x3 matrix. First row is 1, 0, 0. Second row is 0,0,0. Third row is 0,0,-1. So Q is diagonal: the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, the order is important. First P is measured, then Q is measured. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P, right? Because when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, are they measuring P and then Q? Or is the question asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1 when measuring P first and then Q? Or perhaps, after measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q and getting -1?

So let's break it down.

First, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Its norm is sqrt(6), as I thought. So to make it a unit vector, it's (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1]. But perhaps the problem is given as not normalized; I'll have to consider that, but maybe it's not necessary for the probabilities because probabilities involve inner products, which would scale accordingly.

But let me proceed step by step.

First, let's find the possible outcomes when measuring P, and their corresponding eigenstates.

Wait, but measuring operator P. The possible eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of the measurement. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix P.

Alternatively, since P is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real and correspond to the possible measurement outcomes.

Wait, looking at P's matrix. Let me see if I can find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe P can be simplified. Let me see: the matrix P has a specific structure. Let me write it down again:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me see if I can find the eigenvectors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps P has a particular structure
