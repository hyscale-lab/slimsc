Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. 

The problem says that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different lengths, so I'm guessing we're looking for some sort of distance.

Wait, I remember that when particles are moving, their lifetime gets dilated due to time dilation in relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/mc², but since these are in GeV units, maybe I can just use E = gamma m c², so gamma would be E/(m c²), but wait, since c is in there, but the units might work out differently.

Wait, no, because E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) but in natural units (like particle physics), c=1, so E and m are in the same units. So gamma would be E / m. Oh, right because in natural units, E = gamma m c², but since c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma is E/m. So gamma should be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approx 7.917, let me calculate that exactly: 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917.

So gamma is about 7.917. So the dilated lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds, so tau is 7.917 *8e-16 = around 6.334e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles are moving, so the distance they travel before decaying is L = v * tau. But wait, L is the average path length, right? But I'm not sure if that's exactly what we need here. Wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, that suggests that we need to capture the particles before they decay too far away, so that we can observe the decay products.

Wait, another thought: the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula is L = gamma v tau_0. Because tau is gamma tau_0, but v is the velocity. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, the decay probability depends on the length of the path relative to the decay length. So the probability P that the particle decays within a certain length is P = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma c tau_0)) ), but wait, perhaps a different approach. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait
