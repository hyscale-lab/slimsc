Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the reaction's progress using TLC. They observed that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was proceeding, and two new spots had formed. The question is about identifying which of the options could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction. The mechanism here is probably an acid-catalyzed addition, leading to the formation of a bromide and an alcohol, but wait, no, in this case, the starting material is a substituted benzene with an ether group. Oh wait, wait, the structure is an aryl ether with a substituent that's an allyl group attached via an oxygen.

Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. The benzene ring has an oxygen attached, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is -CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait no, wait. Let's see: the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group is four carbons long, with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but the numbering might be different. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4 in the four-carbon chain, right? So the group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl: the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, no, wait. The substituent is 3-en, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-
