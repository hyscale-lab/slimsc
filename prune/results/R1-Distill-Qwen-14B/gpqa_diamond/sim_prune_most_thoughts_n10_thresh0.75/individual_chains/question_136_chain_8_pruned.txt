Okay, so I have this vector field f(r) that falls off as 1/r squared from the origin. And it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that's purely radial is simpler. If the vector field has components only in the radial direction, say f_r, then the divergence is just the derivative of f_r with respect to r, multiplied by some factors, right?

Let me think. Oh yes, the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates when the field is purely radial. So divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Because the other components (theta and phi) are zero.

In this case, the field's magnitude is 1/r², and it's only radial. So f_r is 1/r². So plugging into the divergence formula: (1/r²) * d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ). Wait, r² times (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence would be zero everywhere except maybe at the origin?

Wait, but wait, wait. What about the origin? Because when r is zero, 1/r² blows up. So this vector field probably has a point charge or something at the origin. Like an inverse square law, which makes me think of electric fields or gravitational fields.

Oh right, Gauss's law! The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0
