Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which means the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Oh, wait, the positions are 1, 2, and 3, so substituents are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or maybe I should think about the numbering again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to imagine the substituents on the ring: at position 1, an ethoxy group; position 2, a tert-butyl group; position 3, a nitro group. So, all three substituents are on the ring in a 1,2,3 arrangement, which would make them adjacent in a meta-like fashion, but I might be getting that wrong. Wait no, 1,2,3 are adjacent in a way that each is next to the other, but on a benzene ring, that's not possible because benzene is cyclic with six positions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So when I look at the ring, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent but in a way that each is next to the other, but perhaps not all meta or
