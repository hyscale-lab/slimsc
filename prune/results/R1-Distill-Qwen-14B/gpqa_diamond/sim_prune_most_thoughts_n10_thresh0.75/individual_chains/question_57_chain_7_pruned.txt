Okay, so I have this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. 

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using these phase shifts. Each phase shift δ_l corresponds to a specific angular momentum quantum number l. 

Wait, the formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin( (l+1/2)θ ) ). But wait, what's the imaginary part of this along the incident beam direction? Oh, right, the incident beam direction is θ = 0 degrees because that's along the initial direction of the particles.

So when θ is 0, let's see what happens. sin( (l+1/2)*0 ) would be zero for all l except maybe when l is zero? Wait, no, because for any l, (l+1/2)*0 is 0, so sin(0) is 0. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, maybe the expression is slightly different. Let me think again.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} ) ( (sin( (l + 1/2)θ )) / (sin(θ/2)) ) ) * (1/(2ik)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when θ is 0, some simplifications might occur.

Wait, another approach: when θ=0, the scattering is along the beam direction. For each partial wave, the angular dependence is sin( (l + 1/2)θ ). So when θ=0, each term would be sin(0) which is zero, except possibly for l=0? Wait, when l=0, (l+1/2)θ is (0.5)*0=0, so sin(0) is 0. So all terms would be zero? That can't be right because the options don't have zero as an answer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(θ) when θ=0 is given by the sum of (2l + 1) e^{2
