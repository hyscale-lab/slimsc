Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements and some pericyclic reactions. Hmm, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond moving. I remember that Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this.

The problem has three reactions, A, B, and C. Each of them requires me to determine the product. Let me take each one at a time.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. So, the starting materials are an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon (since it's 1,1-dimethoxy) and an allylic alcohol (but-3-en-2-ol). 

Wait, what's the structure here? 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be N,N-dimethoxyethylamine? Wait, maybe I should draw it. The structure is CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? Or wait, ethan-1-amine would be CH3CH2NH2, but with both OCH3 groups on the first carbon. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-amine has the amine on the first carbon. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OCH3 groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure is OCH3-O-C-NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon: OCH3-O-C-NH2? No, wait, the structure is probably (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, because ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. Wait, maybe it's more accurately represented as (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2. Or perhaps it's (HOCH2CH2NH2) but with OCH3 groups substituting for the hydroxyls? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it
