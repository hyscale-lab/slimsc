Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 because the integral over four dimensions (dx^4) must give a dimensionless result.

So, each term in the Lagrangian should have [Term] = [Mass]^4. Let's break down the components in L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's find the dimensions of each component.

I recall that the Dirac field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. So ψ̄, which is the adjoint, also has 3/2.

Then σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γμ, γν], which is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the [σ_{μν}] is a product of two γ matrices, but in terms of spinor indices, but dimensionally, each γ is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So that part contributes nothing. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Wait, no, because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. But wait, when you multiply fields, you add their dimensions. So ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The gauge field A has dimension 1. So each ∂μ (which is [Mass]^1) acting on A (dimension 1) gives F a dimension of 2. Wait, because each derivative adds mass dimension 1, and A is dim 1. So each term in F is ∂ A, so F itself has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Putting it all together: L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ ψ][F]. The dimensions of the term
