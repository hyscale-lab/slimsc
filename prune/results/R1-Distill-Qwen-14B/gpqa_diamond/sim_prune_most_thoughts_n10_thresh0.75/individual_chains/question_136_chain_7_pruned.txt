Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Alright, let's break it down.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Oh right, so the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². And it's only in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, f(r) is a vector field pointing radially outward (assuming it's positive) and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the radius.

I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is expanding or contracting at a given point. So the divergence of f would tell me how the field is behaving in terms of sources or sinks.

Wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence of f. Oh, right, that's where the Divergence Theorem comes into play. Or wait, what's the Divergence Theorem again? Oh yeah, it relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Mathematically, it's ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, in this case, are we using the Divergence Theorem? Because the integral is over a volume, and the divergence is involved. Alternatively, since the field only has a radial component, maybe I can compute the divergence directly.

Let me think about how to compute the divergence of f. Since the field is radial and in spherical coordinates, the divergence formula for a vector field with only a radial component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). In this case, f_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So substituting that in:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ].

Wait, let's compute it step by step. The radial component f_r is 1/r², since it's only radial. So,

d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = d/dr [ (r²)(r^(-2)) ) ] = d/dr [1] = 0.

So the
