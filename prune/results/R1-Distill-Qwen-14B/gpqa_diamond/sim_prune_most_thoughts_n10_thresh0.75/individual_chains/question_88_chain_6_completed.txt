Okay, so I have this question about immunology, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question is about rotavirus tagged with GFP. They gave it to mice via oral gavage. Then, when they did in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got tangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Then they identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to remember what each part of this experiment is doing. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, and I know it primarily infects the small intestine. The Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized areas where immune responses are initiated against enteric pathogens.

The GFP is tagging the inner capsid proteins. So when they deliver it via oral gavage, the mice's stomachs will try to digest it. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acidâ€”so that's probably because the acid in the stomach breaks down proteins, including the GFP-tagged ones. But some made it through, maybe because the rotavirus is somewhat protected, or perhaps the GFP isn't completely destroyed. Those that survive the stomach acid then move into the intestines.

But then, some were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, etc. So the rotavirus particles probably got stuck in the mucus, which is a protective layer in the gut. Mucus can trap pathogens and prevent them from reaching the immune cells. But in this case, they were able to reach the Peyer's patches, maybe because they were able to get through the mucus or because the immune cells are present in the mucus layer.

Once in the Peyer's patches, the fluorescent particles are taken up by immune cells. Peyer's patches are sites where antigens are sampled, so the immune cells there, like dendritic cells or M cells, would take up the rotavirus. Then, they probably present the antigen to helper T cells, which in turn help B cells to proliferate and differentiate.

The next step is that they isolate the proliferating cell population. So these are likely B cells or T cells that are actively dividing in response to the antigen. When they sequence the variable heavy chain genes of these cells, they see high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process has altered the genes to create diversity.

Now, the options are about different processes.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. That's when B cells undergo mutation in their variable regions during the germinal center reaction. This increases diversity and affinity for the antigen. This happens after the initial response, during the secondary lymphoid organ's reaction.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the immune response where complement proteins are activated, leading to the lysis of pathogens or marking them for phagocytosis. I don't think this would cause variability in the variable heavy chains.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when B cells switch from producing IgM to other classes like IgG, IgA, etc. This changes the class of antibody but doesn't change the variable regions' variability. It's more about the type of antibody produced.

Option D: VDJ recombination. That's the process during B cell or T cell development in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It's how the variable regions are initially generated. But if they're seeing high variability after exposure to an antigen, it's more likely a secondary process like somatic hypermutation.

So the experiment involves exposing mice to rotavirus, which leads to an immune response in the Peyer's patches. The cells isolated are proliferating, which suggests they're activated. The sequencing shows high variability in the variable regions, which is a hallmark of somatic hypermutation. Because the initial VDJ recombination happens during development, but the subsequent mutations happen in response to antigen exposure and are part of the adaptive immune response.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Stomach acid destroys some fluorescence, while others reach the intestines but get entangled in mucus before entering secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. These patches are specialized sites where immune responses to gut pathogens are initiated. The GFP-tagged rotavirus is taken up by immune cells in the Peyer's patches, leading to an immune response. Isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches and sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, suggesting a process that generates diversity in the immune response.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs during the germinal center reaction, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase diversity and affinity for antigens. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves the complement system targeting pathogens for destruction or phagocytosis but does not generate variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variability of the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity during B and T cell development but does not account for the observed variability after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the adaptive immune response in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches.
