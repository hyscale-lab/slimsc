Okay, I have this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the process given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can make some approximations. Wait, slow movement probably means that its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate it as if the antiproton is at rest? Or wait, no, because in reality, even a slow-moving particle has some kinetic energy, but perhaps it's non-relativistic. Or is it?

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its velocity is much less than the speed of light. So maybe I can treat it as a non-relativistic problem. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the initial and final states.

In the initial state, we have a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote their masses as m_p and m_p respectively (since proton and antiproton have the same mass). The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the proton's motion. Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving, but the proton is probably at rest, or maybe both are moving? Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Or maybe the initial momentum comes from the antiproton's movement.

Wait, but in particle physics, when they say a particle is moving, it's the center of mass frame they usually consider. Oh wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since momentum is a vector, and energy is scalar. But because the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the system's total momentum is approximately the same as the antiproton's momentum, assuming the proton is at rest.

Wait, but the initial state is p + p̄. Let me think about their momenta. If the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just
