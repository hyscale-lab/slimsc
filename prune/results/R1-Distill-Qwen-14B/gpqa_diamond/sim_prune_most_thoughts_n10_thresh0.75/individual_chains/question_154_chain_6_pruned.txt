Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's see what information I've been given.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The chemist has provided mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data. There are four options to choose from: A, B, C, D. Hmm, all of them are chlorinated aromatic compounds, it seems.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, which suggests that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. There's also another peak at m/z 158, which is 32% abundant. I'm recalling that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular weight, but the additional peak at 158 is interesting. Maybe it's due to some isotopic peak, like chlorine. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance—about 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%. So if the molecular formula has a Cl atom, the molecular ion could split into peaks at m/z 156 and 158. Let me calculate: if the molecular weight is 156, and assuming it's C8H5ClO3 or something similar, the molecular ion would have a chlorine isotope pattern. Wait, 37Cl would add 2 amu, so the molecular ion would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). But in the problem, the molecular ion is at 156, but the peak at 158 is 32%—so that fits with Cl being present because 37Cl is about 25% abundance. So maybe the molecular weight is 156, and the molecular formula includes one Cl atom. So the molecular formula would be something like CxHyClOz, with a molecular weight of 156.

Now, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually suggests O-H stretching, which could be from a carboxylic acid (which has a broad peak) or an alcohol, but also maybe an aldehyde's -CHO, but that's more of a sharp peak. Wait, another strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. 1720 is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid, maybe ester, or maybe an acid chloride. Let me think: carboxylic acids have O-H (broad around 2500-3500) and C=O around 1700. Esters also have C=O around 1720-1740. Acid chlorides have C=O around 1800, but that's a bit higher than 1720. So maybe ester or acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating for 1H. That's a very downfield shift, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton, but wait, carboxylic acids are typically around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet, which might suggest something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but I thought aldehydes are around 9-10, but maybe more deshielded. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol or carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think again. The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid

C) Phenyl chloroformate

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

So, for each option:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a COOH group. So in IR, it should have a broad O-H around 2500-3500 and a strong C=O around 1700. The NMR would show a broad peak for the COOH proton, but the given NMR has a singlet at 11.0. Wait, benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually broad, not a singlet, and the downfield shift is about 10-12, but as a singlet? Hmm, maybe.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same functional groups as B, but the Cl is in a different position. So same reasoning as B.

Option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. This would have an aldehyde group (-CHO), a hydroxyl (-OH), and a Cl. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes more downfield. The IR would have a strong C=O around 1720? Aldehydes have C=O around 1720. But wait, the IR also has a broad peak from 3500-2700. That could be the aldehyde's O-H (wait, no, aldehydes don't have O-H. They have the CHO group). Wait, the OH in 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be a phenolic -OH, which would show
