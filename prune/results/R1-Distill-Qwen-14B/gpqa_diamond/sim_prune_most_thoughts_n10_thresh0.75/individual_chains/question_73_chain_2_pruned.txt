Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second astronaut has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. They're asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so for the relative speed, since they're moving in the same direction, I guess I need to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. I remember there's a relativistic velocity addition formula for that. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me write that down.

So astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c. But wait, which one is the reference frame? If I want the speed of B as seen from A, then the formula would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula for the relative speed when you have two frames moving at u and v is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about it as the velocity of B as observed from A.

Wait, the general formula is when you have an object moving at velocity u in frame S, and the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis, then the velocity of the object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, frame A is the rest frame of astronaut A, who is moving at u = 0.6c in the lab frame. So to find the speed of astronaut B in A's frame, we use v' = (v_B - u_A)/(1 - (v_B u_A)/c² ), since v_B is the velocity of B in the lab frame and u_A is the velocity of A (
