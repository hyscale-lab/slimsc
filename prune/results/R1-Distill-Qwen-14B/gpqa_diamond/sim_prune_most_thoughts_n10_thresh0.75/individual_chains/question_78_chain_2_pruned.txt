Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, right? Let's think.

The setup says a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time when the field was generated, which is tr. So, the charge's velocity at time tr is v. The vector d is from where the field was generated (the position of the charge at tr) to the observation point r.

I recall that when a charge is moving, it's not just the electric field we have to consider, but also a magnetic field. Maxwell's equations come into play here. The scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field.

Wait, but how do these potentials depend on the velocity of the charge? Oh right, for a static charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things change because of the magnetic effects.

I think the general expressions for V and A when the charge is moving are derived from the retarded potentials. Oh, right, retarded because the potentials depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time. The fields propagate at the speed of light, so the fields at point r and time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to r is t - tr.

So for the scalar potential V, the expression would involve the charge's position at tr. But wait, in the options, I don't see any mention of the charge's position except through vector d. Oh, because vector d is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. So d would be the distance, and the scalar potential might be expressed with some term involving d.

Wait, but in the static case, V is q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point. But when the charge is moving, does the expression change? I think the scalar potential is still (q)/(4πε₀ d'), where d' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But wait, no, because in the moving case, the potentials are affected by the motion.

Wait, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential V is the same as the static case because it's just due to the charge, but the vector potential A comes into play because of the motion.

Let me think about the expression for vector potential. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) times (v × something) or maybe just v itself multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, no, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) times the velocity v divided by the distance, perhaps? Or maybe considering the direction.

Wait, but the options are suggesting different forms. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: V
