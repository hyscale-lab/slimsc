Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma * Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is proportional to their dot product. So the Hamiltonian must be H = -mu · B. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. But wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is often written as H = γ B S · something... Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of spin.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. So mu = gamma * Sz. So the original magnetic field is along +Z, so the initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = - mu · B_initial. Since B_initial is along +Z, H_initial = - gamma B (Sz).

But wait, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian would be H_final = - mu · B_new, which is along +Y. So H_final = - gamma B (S_y). Because mu = gamma S_z, so the dot product with B in y direction is gamma S_y multiplied by B.

Wait, wait no. Wait, no. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but wait, wait. No, the magnetic moment for spin is usually mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So the magnetic moment has components mu_x = gamma Sx, mu_y = gamma Sy, mu_z = gamma Sz.

So the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. So in the initial case, B is along z, so H_initial = -gamma B Sz.

When the field is turned off, then turned on in y
