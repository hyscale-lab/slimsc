Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x. I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state vector and the operator. 

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if the coefficients square to 1. Let me calculate 0.5^2 = 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Adding them gives 1, so it's a valid state. Good.

The operator given is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value is the sum of the expectation values of each term. I think I can compute each separately and then add them.

First, let's find ⟨ψ| (10σ_z) |ψ⟩. Since σ_z is diagonal in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis, maybe that's easier. The matrix for σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I apply σ_z to |↑⟩, I get |↑⟩, and to |↓⟩, I get -|↓⟩.

So the expectation value of σ_z for the state ψ is |0.5|^2 * (1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation of σ_z is -0.5. Multiply by 10, that's -5.

Next, the expectation value of σ_x. σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states. Its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩. 

Wait, how do I compute that? I think it's the sum of the products of the amplitudes. So the state ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The σ_x matrix swaps the components, so σ_x |ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. So the inner product ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Let me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is the same. So total is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So the expectation of σ_x is approximately 0.866.

Multiply that by 5, so 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts: the first term was -5, and the second is about 4.33. So total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Oh wait, but wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Let me re-calculate the σ_x part more carefully.

Another approach: The expectation value of σ_x is given by 2 Re[ ⟨↑| ψ ⟩ ⟨ψ| ↓⟩ ]. Wait, maybe I should use that formula. Let me see. Since ψ is a linear combination, ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Then ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is |a|^2 - |b|^2? No, wait, no, that's for σ_z. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the expectation of σ_x is 2 (a b* + a* b), because ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 (a b* + a* b). So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. a* b is the same as a b* since both are real. So 2*(2*(sqrt(3)/4))=2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3). Wait, that gives ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3) ≈1.732? That can't be right because earlier I thought it was 0.866. Hmm, I must have messed up.

Wait, wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. The state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Then σ_x |ψ⟩ = a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩. The inner product ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is a* (a* ⟨↑| σ_x |↓⟩ + b* ⟨↓| σ_x |↑⟩) + b* (a ⟨↑| σ_x |↑⟩ + b ⟨↓| σ_x |↓⟩).

But ⟨↑| σ_x |↓⟩ is 1, because σ_x |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. Similarly, ⟨↓| σ_x |↑⟩ is 1. And ⟨↑| σ_x |↑⟩ is 0, because σ_x |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so the inner product is 0. Similarly for ⟨↓| σ_x |↓⟩. So putting that together:

⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ = a* (a* *1 + b* *1) + b* (a *0 + b *0 )
= a* a* + a* b* + 0 + 0.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it directly: ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ = [a*, b*] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a, b]^T.

So let's compute that matrix multiplication. The matrix σ_x is [[0 1],[1 0]], so when we multiply σ_x with |ψ⟩, which is [a; b], we get [b; a]. Then, the inner product with ⟨ψ| is [a*, b*] [b; a]. So that's a* b + b* a. Since a and b are real, it's 2ab.

So in our case, a =0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )=
