Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that we need to calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables like momentum or spin, but the specifics here might be a bit different.

The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I should probably write them down.

Let me jot them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, meaning P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z, right? Because the direction n is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the direction is in x-z, so n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or wait, no, arbitrary in x-z, so φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps it's more general. Hmm, maybe the direction n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, but for arbitrary direction, maybe we just use θ as the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, the problem says n lies in the x-z plane, so the direction is arbitrary in that plane. So the vector n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can just consider n in terms of an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, I think. Wait, no, actually, when θ is the angle from the z-axis, then yes, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since we're in x-z, φ is 0 or π, perhaps.

But wait, maybe the operator P is the spin operator. Because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 particles like the muon. So, the operator P is probably the spin operator, and the direction n is the quantization axis for which we're finding the eigenvector.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the state |ψ> is the eigenstate with spin up along direction n.

In quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along a direction n can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of the corresponding Pauli matrix.

So, the general approach is to find the eigenvector of the operator P = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z) corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, another approach: For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of the spin operator along any direction can be expressed using the spherical harmonics or in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in the basis where the operator P is diagonal. But since the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction, I might need to construct it using the direction's spherical components.

Wait, let me think. The operator P is given by
