Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question to tackle. Let me start by carefully reading through the problem to understand what's going on.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to produce two products: major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The key part is the NOESY NMR spectra where the major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of such acids typically forms an anhydride. But the question specifies that the anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in the 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Hmm, 7 ppm in 1H NMR. That's a strong deshielded proton signal. Maybe an aromatic proton? Or something like an enol or conjugated system. Wait, but wait, the anhydride. Let me think about the structure of the anhydride here.

An anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid would have two carbonyl groups connected via an oxygen. The 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 165 is probably a carbonyl (like the anhydride's carbonyl groups). The 137 ppm is somewhere around a sp2 carbon, maybe adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps the alkene.

Wait, but the starting material had a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, the alkene remains? Or does it change?

Wait, dehydration of a diacid with a cis-alkene would form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would depend on where the acid groups are. Let me imagine the diacid: perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's not an alkene. Or maybe HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, but the initial structure has a cis-alkene. So perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH wouldn't have an alkene, so maybe HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that's a trans or cis configuration.

Wait, dehydration of a diacid with a cis-alkene to form an anhydride... the dehydration would form an anhydride, possibly cyclic. But the presence of a single peak at 7 ppm suggests something specific. Maybe it's a cyclopropane ring? Because cyclopropane protons can resonate around 1 ppm, but wait, 7 ppm is higher. Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has a conjugated double bond, so the protons are deshielded. Maybe it's a substituted cyclopentene or something else.

Wait, the 13C NMR has 137 and 165. 165 is a carbonyl, so two of them probably. The 137 is probably a vinylic (sp2) carbon. Maybe the anhydride structure is such that there's a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. So only one set of protons is present, which integrates to a certain number. But wait, it's a single peak, so no splitting. So maybe equivalent protons, or maybe no other protons except for the one peak.

Wait, but an anhydride would have the
