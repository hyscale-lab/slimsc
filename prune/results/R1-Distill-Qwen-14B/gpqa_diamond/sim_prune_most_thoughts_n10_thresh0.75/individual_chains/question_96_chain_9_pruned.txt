Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a supermassive black hole and its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are from 10^59 up to 10^66 J/K, so the answer is going to depend on some key formulas.

First, I remember that the event horizon of a black hole is a sphere with radius r = 2GM/c², where M is the mass. But I'm not sure how the angular size relates to the radius. Oh wait, angular size is related to the actual size and distance. Using trigonometry, the formula θ ≈ r/d (in radians) for small angles. So maybe I can find r using θ, d, and then find M from r.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians because radians are needed for small angle approximation.
2. Calculate the radius of the event horizon using r ≈ θ * d.
3. From the radius, find the mass M of the black hole using r = 2GM/c².
4. Once I have M, calculate the entropy S of the black hole, which I think is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The formula for entropy is S = (k_B * A) / (4 * ħ c), where A is the area, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, I think the formula for entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), or something like that. Or wait, maybe S = (k_B A) / (4 ħ c) multiplied by something else? I'm a bit confused here. I'll try to remember the exact formula.

Wait, no, I think the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B * A) / (4 * ħ c), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or was it (k_B c^3 A)/(4
