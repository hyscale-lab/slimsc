Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound X is C11H12O. It reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. The options are four different epoxides, I think, because all the options have "oxirane" or "epoxide" in their names.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base, maybe used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, it's often used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is pretty high. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Wait, maybe it's an elimination reaction? Or maybe it's a ring-opening followed by something else.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's break down the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not near any protons, maybe an aromatic ring or a carbonyl. Wait, but in the options, all are epoxides. So maybe adjacent to an oxygen? Or maybe a methyl near an aromatic ring.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet methyl. So two methyl groups, each as singlets. That suggests they're in symmetric positions or not near any protons.

- The rest are aromatic protons. Let's see:
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d)
   - δ7.08 (2H, d)
   - δ7.68 (1H, d)
   - δ7.71 (2H, d)
Hmm, this looks like a pattern of a substituted benzene ring, maybe with substituents causing splitting. Let's think about coupling. The doublets suggest adjacent protons. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with some substituents.

Wait, let me try to figure out the aromatic region. Let's imagine a benzene ring with substituents. The 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) might form a triplet of doublets, but no, each is a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to the ring, like a styrene group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trans coupling. Wait, the downfield shifts suggest some substituents. Let me think of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, maybe an electron-withdrawing group and something else.

Wait, the 13C NMR data is also given. Let me look at that.

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s): A methyl group, probably attached to something like an oxygen or a carbonyl group. Wait, 21 is low for a methyl attached to oxygen. Wait, oxirane (epoxide) has two adjacent carbons which are usually in the 40-60 ppm range. Alternatively, a methyl adjacent to an oxygen would be around 50s? Hmm, not sure.

- 28.4 (1C, s): Another methyl. So two methyl carbons, each as singlets. Probably two methyl groups attached to different parts of the molecule.

Then, the aromatic carbons:
- 126.9 (2C, s): Two equivalent aromatic carbons, perhaps para to each other.
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The signals
