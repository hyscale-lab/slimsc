Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is some kind of hyperbolic surface, right? The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)](dx² + dy²). Wait, I think I've seen similar metrics before. Oh yeah, this looks like it's related to hyperbolic geometry. 

So the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, no, wait—the radius isn't given directly here. Let me think. The metric has a denominator of (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 as a constant. Oh, because 4 is (2)^2, so the radius r is 2. That matches the question.

I remember that in hyperbolic space, the area element is related to the metric. The area element in 2D is usually sqrt(det g) dxdy, where g is the metric tensor. Since the metric is conformally flat here, because it's written as a multiple of (dx² + dy²), the determinant should be straightforward. 

So the metric can be written as ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor g is E², because the off-diagonal terms are zero. Therefore, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dxdy, which is E dxdy. 

So substituting E, dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. 

Wait, but what's the region over which we integrate this to find the area? The metric is only valid where the denominator is positive, right? Because if 4 - x² - y² is positive, the metric is real. So the condition is x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. 

So to find the total area, I need to integrate dA over this disk. So the integral becomes the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. 

Hmm, that integral looks a bit tricky. Maybe I should switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. 

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. 

The integrand simplifies to [32 r ]/(4 - r²). Let me compute the inner integral first, the r integral. So ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. 

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. 

So the integral becomes ∫ (32) * [r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u from u=4 to u=0. 

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln|u| ] evaluated from 4 to 0. Let's compute that. 

But wait, when u approaches zero, ln u approaches negative infinity. So let me see:

32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] 

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (32 * (-1/2)) [ -infty - ln4 ] = 16 [ infty - ln4 ] which goes to positive infinity. 

Wait, that can't be right because the area of a pseudosphere should be finite. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. 

Wait, the substitution: when r goes from 0 to2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes ∫ (32) * [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) 

Let me re-express it. Let me factor out 4 in the denominator: 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4(1 - (r/2)^2). But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²). Let me set u = 4 - r², so du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr. 

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ [ (-1/2) du ]/u 

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0. 

So ∫ 1/u du from 4 to 0 is [ln u] from 4 to 0 → ln0 - ln4. But ln0 is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) = (1/2)( infty + ln4 ), which is positive infinity. 

So the inner integral is infinite. Then, multiplying by the theta integral (which is 2π), the whole area becomes infinite (since 2π * ∞ is ∞). 

Wait, but that can't be right. I thought that the pseudosphere has finite area. Let me think about it. The pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, certain surfaces have finite area. For example, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix) has finite area. 

Wait, but maybe I got the metric wrong. Let me think: the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it's a 2D metric. But wait, I'm trying to find the area of the pseudosphere. Oh, wait—pseudosphere is a 2D surface? Or is this the metric for a 3D space? Hmm, no, the metric is written in 2D (dx and dy), so perhaps it's a 2D surface. But a pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in 3D. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the metric of the hyperbolic plane with that of the pseudosphere. Let me think again. The hyperbolic plane has a metric that's similar but with different coefficients. For example, the Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). But the given metric here is different: 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which would be (2)^2 - (x² + y²). 

Wait, maybe I should compare to the Poincaré model. The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space of radius a has metric ds² = [4a²/(a² - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Alternatively, in isothermal coordinates, the metric might look different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic space of a certain curvature. The general form for hyperbolic space in isothermal coordinates is ds² = (4κ²)/(1 - (r²/κ²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where κ is related to the curvature. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. The Gaussian curvature K is determined from the metric. For a conformally flat metric ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2φ} [ (e^{2φ})_{xx} + (e^{2φ})_{yy} ] 

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2f²)) [ (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} ] 

Wait, let's compute that. So f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - x² - y²) 

So ln f = (ln 32^(1/2)) ) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²) 

Wait, no, more accurately: f(x,y) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^{1/2} 

So ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²) 

So (ln f)_{xx} = (-1/2) * [ (-2x) / (4 - x² - y²) ) ]  = ( x ) / (4 - x² - y²) 

Similarly, (ln f)_{yy} = ( y ) / (4 - x² - y²) 

So (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} = (x + y)/(4 - x² - y²) 

Wait, but that can't be right because (x + y) is not symmetric in x and y. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the derivatives. Let's double-check.

Wait, the second derivatives. Let me compute (ln f)_{xx}:

f = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^{1/2} 
ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²) 

So the first derivative with respect to x is: (0) - (1/2) * [ (-2x) / (4 - x² - y²) ] 
Which is (x)/(4 - x² - y²) 

Then the second derivative with respect to x:

d/dx [x/(4 - x² - y²) ] 

= [ (4 - x² - y²)(1) + x(2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

= [4 - x² - y² + 2x² ] / denominator 

= [4 + x² - y² ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Similarly, (ln f)_{yy}:

= [4 - x² - y² + 2y² ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

= [4 - x² + y² ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

So the sum (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} is 

[4 + x² - y² + 4 - x² + y² ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

= [8 ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

So the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = -(1/(2 f²)) [ (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} ]

f² is 32 / (4 - x² - y²), so 1/(2 f²) = (4 - x² - y²) / (64) 

So substituting,

K = - [ (8) / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ] * (4 - x² - y²)/(64) )

= - [8 * (4 - x² - y²) ] / [64 (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

The numerator is 8 (4 - x² - y²)
Denominator: 64 (4 - x² - y²)^2 

So 8/64 = 1/8. 

So K = - [ (4 - x² - y²) * 1/8 ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) )

Wait no, wait, let me re-calculate the denominator. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²)^2, so:

(4 - x² - y²) in numerator cancels with one (4 - x² - y²) in denominator, leaving (4 - x² - y²)^1 in the denominator.

So K = ( - [8 * (4 - x² - y²) ] ) / [64 (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ]

= - 8/(64 (4 - x² - y²)) 

Simplify: 8/64 is 1/8, so K = -1/(8 (4 - x² - y²)) 

Wait, wait, but that doesn't make sense because Gaussian curvature should be a constant for a pseudosphere. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the metric is for a space of constant curvature. Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the Gaussian curvature is negative and constant. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute K more accurately.

Wait, another formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is f(dx² + dy²) is K = - [ (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} ] / (2 f²) 

Wait, in our case, f = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) 

So ln f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²) 

As before, (ln f)_{xx} is [ x ]/(4 - x² - y²) 

Similarly, (ln f)_{yy} is [ y ]/(4 - x² - y²) 

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct this. 

Wait, (ln f)_{x} = (0) - (1/2) * [ (-2x)/(4 - x² - y²) ) ] 
= x/(4 - x² - y²) 

Then, (ln f)_{xx} is derivative of x/(4 - x² - y²) with respect to x. 

Using the quotient rule: [ (4 - x² - y²)(1) + x(2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Which is (4 -x² -y² + 2x² ) / denominator 

= (4 + x² - y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Similarly, (ln f)_{yy} is (4 - x² + y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

So the sum is (4 + x² - y² + 4 - x² + y²) / denominator 

= (8) / denominator 

So (ln f)_{xx} + (ln f)_{yy} = 8 / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

So K = -(1/(2 f² )) * [8/(4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ]

f² is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so 1/(2 f²) = (4 - x² - y²)/(64) 

So K = - [ 8/(4 - x² - y²)^2 ] * [ (4 - x² - y²)/(64) ) ]

= - [ 8 (4 - x² - y²) ] / [64 (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ]

= - [ 8 ] / [64 (4 - x² - y²) ) ]

Simplify: 8/64 is 1/8. 

So K = -1/(8 (4 - x² - y²)) 

Wait, but that depends on x and y, which would mean the curvature varies, which can't be right for a pseudosphere. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. 

Wait, maybe the given metric isn't for a pseudosphere but for a different surface. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the area another way. 

Wait, going back to the area computation, the area is the integral of the area element. The area element is [32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)] dx dy. The domain is x² + y² <4. 

So when we compute the integral ∫∫ [32/(4 - r^2)] r dr dθ from r=0 to 2 and θ=0 to 2π. 

So the integral becomes 32 * 2π ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2. 

Let me compute ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2. 

Let me make substitution u =4 - r²; du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2 

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u from u=4 to u=0. 

Which is (-1/2) [ ln |u| ] from 4 to 0 → (-1/2) (ln 0 - ln4) 

But ln0 is negative infinity, so this becomes (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) → (1/2)(infty + ln4) 

Which is infinity. So the integral is infinite, which would make the area infinite. 

But this contradicts my previous thought that a pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric of the hyperbolic plane with that of the pseudosphere. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a compact surface. Wait, no—the pseudosphere is not compact; it's a surface of infinite extent, right? Because it's created by rotating a tractrix, which has infinite length. So its area might be infinite. 

Wait, but the question options include answer D as +infty. So perhaps the area is infinite, which would mean the answer is D. 

But wait, the options are A) 0, B)4pi(x² + y²), C) 4pi(x² - y²), D)+infty. 

So the correct answer would be D. 

But wait, let me think again. The integral of the area element is divergent. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the correct option is D. 

But why is the metric given in this way? Oh because in this metric, as you approach the boundary (r approaching 2), the area element blows up, leading to infinite area. So the surface extends infinitely in some way, which makes the area infinite. 

So the answer should be D) +infty.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2D surface with a conformally flat metric. To compute the area of the pseudosphere with radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element \(dA\), which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is conformally flat, \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), as the metric is only real and non-singular within this domain. To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over this disk. Switching to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at the boundary \(r = 2\).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Answer: D
