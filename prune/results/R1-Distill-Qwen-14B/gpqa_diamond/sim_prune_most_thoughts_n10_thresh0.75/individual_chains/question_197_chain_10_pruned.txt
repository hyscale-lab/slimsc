Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. It's a multiple-choice question involving organic chemistry, specifically reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Hmm, I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the IR data. I remember that IR spectroscopy helps identify functional groups based on the absorption bands. The peaks given are in the ranges: 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹.

The big peaks around 3400–2500 usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since we're dealing with organic compounds, O-H is more likely. O-H could be from carboxylic acids, alcohols, or maybe even an ester if it's an -OH in a different environment. But wait, there's also a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for either a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H peak around 3000-2500) or maybe an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. But since the O-H is in the 3400-2500 region and we have that strong carbonyl, carboxylic acid is a possibility.

Looking at the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. These are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring with some substitution.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR data. Let's list out the signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually are around 7-8 ppm. But 10.5 is quite upfield for a proton on an aromatic ring. Wait, unless it's an aldehyde proton, which is around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's an exchangeable proton, like an -OH in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid protons are typically around 10-12 ppm and are broad because they exchange easily. So, this could be a carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets. If it's an aromatic ring with two substituents, perhaps para-substituted. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents each having two protons. But wait, the integration is 2H each. So, maybe an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions, each having two protons. Wait, maybe it's a para-disubstituted benzene where each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent H's to be in a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single substituent that splits the aromatic protons into doublets.

Wait, another possibility: if the aromatic ring has two substituents, each adjacent to each other, but that might give more complex splitting. Hmm, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each of which is an electron-withdrawing group that deshields the adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene where the substituent causes the ring currents to split the protons into two sets of doublets. For example, in a para-substituted compound, like p-xylene, the two H's on each adjacent carbon would be equivalent. Wait, but in p-xylene, all four aromatic protons are equivalent, so they should be a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring, but that usually leads to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that causes the ring
