Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization... that's the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water, right? And it's usually measured in kJ/mol of H+ or OH- neutralized. Oh right, the standard value is around -57 kJ/mol, but here they might be asking for the total heat for this specific reaction.

But wait, this isn't just a simple acid-base reaction. There are three solutions being mixed. So I need to figure out all the H+ and OH- ions involved and see which one is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-.
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4: It's also a strong acid and it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Adding those together, total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So, H+ is 0.28 moles and OH- is 0.2 moles. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

But wait, which is the limiting reagent here? The OH- is 0.2 moles, and H+ is 0.28. So OH- will be used up completely, and there'll be some H+ left over.

So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. But wait, is it? Because for each mole of OH-, one mole of H+ is used. So yeah, 0.2 moles each.

Wait, but wait another thing. The H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole. What about the possibility of excess H+ after neutralization?

But in this case, since Ba(OH)2 is the limiting reactant, the reaction will use up all the OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

So the total enthalpy change would be based on the moles of H+ neutralized, which is 0.2 moles. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are given in kcal and kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh wait, units matter. So I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. The enthalpy of neutralization can also be given per mole of acid or per mole of base. Wait, no, for strong acids and bases, it's per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the question says "enthalpy of neutralization when [...] are mixed." So perhaps I need to compute the total heat released, not per mole.

So, I calculated 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized. Each mole releases 57 kJ (but since it's exothermic, it's negative). So 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, the question uses kcal as an option. Oh wait, did I forget the unit conversion?

Wait, because 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, but wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57 kJ/mol. But sometimes it's expressed in kcal. 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal.

Wait, so 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.683 kcal.
