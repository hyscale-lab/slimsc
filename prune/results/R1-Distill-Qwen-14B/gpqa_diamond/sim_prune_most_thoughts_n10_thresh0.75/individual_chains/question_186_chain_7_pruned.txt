Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a conjugated diene and an adjacent bridge, right? It's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Let me think.

The compound in question is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, let me parse that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? So the bridge has two carbons, two, and one. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5, perhaps?

Wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen in the ring. Because in azabicyclo, the numbering probably starts with the nitrogen as position 1. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have seven atoms in total, with bridges of 2, 2, and 1 carbons.

So the structure would have the nitrogen at position 2, and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) also at position 2. Additionally, there's a double bond at position 5. So the molecule is bicyclic with a bridge, a nitrogen, a vinyl group, and a double bond.

When undergoing a Cope rearrangement, the molecule should have a 1,5-diene system. Wait, the Cope rearrangement typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? So I need to see if the molecule has such a system.

Wait, let me visualize the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. The nitrogen is at position 2. So perhaps the structure is such that the double bonds are in positions that can form a conjugated diene.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bonds are at positions 2 (from the vinyl group) and the 5 position. Hmm, but the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the double bonds are
