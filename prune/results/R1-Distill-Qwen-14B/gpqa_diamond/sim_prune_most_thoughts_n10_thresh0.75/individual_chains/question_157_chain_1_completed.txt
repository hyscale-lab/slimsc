Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I remember that retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? Like HIV. So their genetic material is RNA. 

The question is asking about the steps to design the kit. Let's look at the options. 

Option A says to identify the virus based on symptoms and then use nested PCR. Wait, but symptoms can be non-specific, right? Plus, PCR requires knowing specific sequences to target. So maybe it's not the best first step to rely on symptoms for identification. I think you need to actually sequence the virus to find its genetic markers first.

Option B suggests doing cDNA sequencing first. Oh, because retroviruses make DNA from their RNA. So to get their genetic info, you might sequence the cDNA. Then develop a real-time PCR kit. Real-time PCR is good for quantifying and being more accurate, so that sounds plausible.

Option C talks about DNA sequencing. But wait, the virus is RNA-based. Unless they're making cDNA first. So maybe this isn't the first step. Unless the option is suggesting using DNA from the host, but I think for a virus, you would start with RNA.

Option D suggests looking for IgG antibodies. ELISA tests are for antibodies, which the body produces in response to the virus. But if the goal is a quick molecular test (like PCR), then antibodies might not be the target because that's more about the immune response, which takes time to develop. Plus, the question is about designing a molecular diagnostic kit, which I think refers to detecting the virus itself, not antibodies.

So putting it together: to design a PCR-based test, you first need the genetic sequence of the virus to design primers. Since it's a retrovirus, you'd probably make cDNA from its RNA. So the first step would be cDNA sequencing to get the genetic info, then use that to make primers for real-time PCR, which is quick and accurate.

Looking at the options again, option B says first cDNA sequencing, then real-time PCR. That makes sense. Option C uses DNA sequencing, but the virus's genome is RNA, so unless it's about the host's DNA, which doesn't make sense here.

Wait, but sometimes when you sequence a virus, you might clone it into DNA first, hence cDNA. So yeah, option B is looking correct.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. The process begins by identifying the virus through sequencing its genetic material. Since retroviruses use RNA as their genetic material, the first step involves performing cDNA sequencing. This step converts the viral RNA into cDNA, allowing for the identification of specific genetic markers. Once the genetic sequence is obtained, primers can be designed for a real-time PCR assay. Real-time PCR is highly sensitive, specific, and provides quick and accurate results, making it ideal for diagnosing the virus.

Option A relies on symptoms to identify the virus, which is not reliable for designing a molecular diagnostic kit. Option C suggests DNA sequencing, but the virus's genome is RNA, so this is not the appropriate first step. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using an ELISA kit, which is based on the immune response rather than the virus itself and is less suitable for a molecular diagnostic kit. Therefore, the correct approach is to perform cDNA sequencing first and then develop a real-time PCR kit.

Answer: B
