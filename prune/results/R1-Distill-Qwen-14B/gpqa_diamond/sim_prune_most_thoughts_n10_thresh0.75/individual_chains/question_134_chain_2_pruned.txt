Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, okay, I should start by recalling what enthalpy of neutralization means. From what I remember, it's the change in enthalpy when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes it's given in calories too.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh, wait, mixing all three together. That sounds a bit tricky. I think when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. But here, we have two acids and a base, so maybe the base will neutralize both acids.

Let me think: HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and since it's Ba, which is a +2 ion, each molecule can provide two OH- ions.

So first, I need to find out how much of each acid and base is present in terms of moles. Because the neutralization depends on the mole ratio.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

For HCl: the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. The molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in L). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

For H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. So each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L, molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Okay, so total H+ from acids: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So which is the limiting reagent here? Let's see:

We have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-. So OH- will be the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait wait, but wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in a solution, the first H+ is more readily donated, and the second H+ is weaker. But in neutralization, especially with a strong base, I think both H+ ions from H2SO4 would be neutralized. Or maybe in this case, since the base is not in excess, only part of the H+ would be neutralized.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. The H2SO4 is strong, so it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So the total H+ is 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.1 (from HCl) = 0.
