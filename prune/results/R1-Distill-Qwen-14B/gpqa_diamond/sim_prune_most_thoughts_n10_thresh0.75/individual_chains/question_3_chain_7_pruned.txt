Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and the answer should be up to one decimal place. 

Hmm, right. So, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. 

The state here is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which means that when you apply σz, you just get back the eigenvalue times the state. 

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. So, the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so I can break this into two parts.

First, I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately, then combine them.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy. Let me recall that σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So, the expectation value of σz in the state ψ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of being in |↓⟩.

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients must be 1. So, (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. That's correct.

The coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is 0.5² = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, which squared is 3/4, so 0.75. 

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving on to σx. Hmm, the expectation value of σx is a bit trickier. Because σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin states. So, maybe I need to express ψ in terms of the eigenstates of σx or find another way to compute ⟨σx⟩.

Alternatively, I can compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ directly. Let me think about how to compute σx acting on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Because σx is the spin-flip operator. So, if I represent |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as basis vectors, perhaps the matrix form of σx would help. 

Let me write σx as a matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when you apply σx to |↑⟩, which is [1;0], you get [0;1], which is |↓⟩. Similarly, applying σx to |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

So, I can compute σx|ψ⟩. Let's write |ψ⟩ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1], then ψ is 0.5*|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*|↓⟩.

So, ψ vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx * ψ would be [ (0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2)), (1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)) ]^T. 

Calculating each component:
First component: 0.5*0 is 0, plus 1*(sqrt(3)/2) → sqrt(3)/2.
Second component: 1*(0.5) + 0 → 0.5.

So, σx|ψ⟩ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† (which is the row vector) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. 

So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Wait, let me compute this matrix multiplication:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

So, that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Each term is (sqrt(3)/4). So sum is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I do that correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So, the inner product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Yes, that's the same. So, each term is (sqrt(3)/4), so sum is (sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, but sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

But I should keep it exact for now. Let me think—maybe there's a more straightforward way to compute this without going through the matrix.

Alternatively, another method: the expectation value of σx is (probability that the state is in |→⟩ when measured in x-direction) minus (probability that it's in |←⟩). But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Wait, maybe using expectation value formula for σx. Since σx is an observable, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which is another observable. So, perhaps I can express the state in the σx basis.

But I think the method I did
