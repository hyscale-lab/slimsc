Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see. The question involves a series of reactions starting from cyclohexanone, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

Alright, let me break down each step one by one.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The structure would be a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl group (C=O).

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Wait, bromine addition to a ketone... Oh, right! When ketones are treated with halogens like Br2, it's usually a halogen addition. But wait, in which conditions? Do I need to think about enol formation or something else? Oh wait, no, another possibility is that cyclohexanone in this context might undergo a ring-opening if it's in an acid condition or maybe an addition via enol. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's a bromination via an enol. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a dihalide addition if there's an alpha position available.

Wait, cyclohexanone has alpha carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the alpha positions are those CH2 groups next to the ketone. So, when you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, what typically happens? Oh, I think that's the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, where a halogen is added to the alpha position. But wait, that usually requires a catalyst like a carboxylic acid or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, but ketones don't usually add Br2 in the same way as alkenes.

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a bromination via an enol intermediate. When ketones are treated with a base, they can form enolates, which can then react with electrophiles. But in this case, the reaction is with bromine, Br2, which is a di-electrophile. So perhaps cyclohexanone is undergoing an alpha bromination.

Wait, but without a base, how would that happen? Maybe the reaction is a simple addition. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing bromination on
