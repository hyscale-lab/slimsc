Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

The question says that there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. They want to send a 22-year-old astronaut to Earth, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, the options given are A to D. Option A says the astronaut dies before reaching Earth. The others are specific numbers. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time, I think.

Time dilation in special relativity comes into play here because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). The proper time (tau) experienced by the astronaut is the coordinate time (T) divided by gamma, right?

Wait, no, actually, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which is the astronaut's frame. So the time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is equal to T multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²), because gamma is 1/sqrt(...), so tau = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, T is the time measured in the Earth's frame. So I need to find T first, the time it takes to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth as measured in Earth's frame, and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but wait! The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. How far away is it? I think it's about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, I'm not sure, but let's suppose that's the distance. Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, hold on. The question says "their destination is Earth", but how far away is Earth from the LMC? Oh, right, Earth is in the Milky Way, so the distance between the LMC and Earth is roughly 160,000 light-years. So the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth, a distance of
