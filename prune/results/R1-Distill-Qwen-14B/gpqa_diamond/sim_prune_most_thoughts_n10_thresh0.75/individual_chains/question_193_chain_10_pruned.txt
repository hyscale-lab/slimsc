Okay, let's see. I have this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. 

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, no, actually, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d (d in parsecs). That means d = 1/plx.

So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute d into that equation. Let me write that down:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Wait, let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait no, wait. Let me recheck. 1 over (1/d)^5 is 1 multiplied by d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so perhaps I'm looking for the rate of change, like dN/dr. Because the option says per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's asking about the change in number as a function of r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases as r^5. But the options are about how it changes with per unit r.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d: plx
