Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, I remember that compounds with the formula C3H6 are alkenes because the general formula for alkenes is CnH2n. So for n=3, it's C3H6. So Compound A is probably propene or maybe cyclopropane? Wait, cyclopropane is C3H6 too, but it's a cyclic compound. But considering the reactions, I think it's more likely propene because of the bromination step that's mentioned.

So, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I think that's a free radical addition reaction, which typically occurs with alkenes. So when propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it should undergo addition across the double bond. The product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Or wait, maybe it's 1,2 addition? Propene has three carbons. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond. The structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add a Br to each of the double-bond carbons. So it becomes BrCH2-CHBr-CH3? I think that's correct.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good condition for elimination. So probably an E2 mechanism, leading to the formation of an alkene. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with KOH, it should eliminate HBr. Since there are two Brs, possibly forming a more substituted alkene. Let's think: the structure of B is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the initial compound A is C3H6. If A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), then adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the structure is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, that's not right. For propene (CH2=CH2CH3), adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Oh, wait, no. Let me correct: the structure of propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when this compound B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. Oh wait, but in this case, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So, when treated with KOH, it's likely to eliminate to form an alkene. But wait, if you have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, elimination can occur. So the product C would be propene again? Or maybe a different alkene?

Wait, elimination in 1,2-dibromopropane: for example, two adjacent Brs on C
