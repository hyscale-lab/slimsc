Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by the process γγ → e+e−. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path can limit how far they can travel before interacting. This process affects the maximum energy they can have without being absorbed quickly.

Wait, the process in question is the inverse Compton scattering or maybe pair production? Oh, wait, the process is specifically gamma plus gamma annihilating into electron-positron pairs. So that's a photon-photon interaction. 

The key here is probably the cross-section for this process. But I'm not too clear on the exact formula. I think the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs depends on the energy of the photons involved.

I remember that the cross-section for this process increases as the photon energies increase. But how does that affect the lifetime of the gamma-ray? Oh right, the lifetime is determined by the photon's mean free path. If the mean free path is small, the photon can't travel far before annihilating, so its lifetime is short.

So the mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate, which involves the cross-section σ multiplied by the number of target photons n. The interaction rate Γ would be something like Γ = σ * n * c, where c is the speed of light. Then the mean lifetime τ would be 1/Γ.

Wait, alternatively, the mean free path λ is given by 1/(nσ), assuming n is the number density of the target photons. So for a gamma-ray with energy E, the mean free path λ is 1/(n * σ(E)).

So the lifetime τ is the mean free path divided by the expansion rate of the universe, maybe. Or wait, considering the expansion, but perhaps for this problem, it's a simpler approach.

The CMB photon has an energy of about 1e-3 eV. Let me denote the gamma-ray energy as E and the CMB photon energy as E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is a function of the two photon energies. The cross-section might be given by some formula, but I'm not exactly sure. I think the cross-section is proportional to (E γ E_cmb) / m_e^2, or something like that. Wait, or is it possible that when the center-of-mass energy exceeds twice the electron mass (which is about 0.511 MeV), the process becomes possible. So the threshold condition is when the combined energy in the center of mass frame is at least 2m_e c^2.

So the condition for the process to occur is that the center-of-mass (CM) energy is above 2m_e. The CM energy squared s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 (since photons are massless, their energy is E = pc). But since photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming a head-on collision), the calculation changes. 

Wait, for two photons moving in opposite directions, the total energy squared would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me compute that: (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2. So the invariant s is (4 E1 E2 c^4), and the square of the CM energy is s = (4 E1 E2 c^2)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, the square of the total 4-momentum is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c) · (p1 c + p2 c). But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Let me think: let’s say photon 1 has momentum vector p1 = (E1/c, 0, 0, E1/c) and photon 2 has p2 = (E2/c, 0, 0, -E2/c). Then the sum of their momenta is (E1 + E2)/c in the x-component, and (E1 - E2)/c in the z-component. Wait, maybe I should compute the 4-momentum squared.

The 4-momentum is (E1 + E2, p1x + p2x, p1y + p2y, p1z + p2z). For photons moving along the same line (say, z-axis), if one is moving in +z and the other in -z, then p1z = E1/(c^2) * c (since for photons, E = pc, so p = E/(c)). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the threshold condition. The minimum energy required for the photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is when the total energy in the CM frame is exactly 2 m_e c^2. So the product of the energies of the two photons must be at least (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

So E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

Wait, that's the condition. Because at threshold, s = (2 m_e c^2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions. So let me compute that.

Suppose photon 1 has energy E and photon 2 has energy E_cmb. Let's assume they're moving head-on. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Then, the total energy is E + E_cmb, and the total momentum is |E/c - E_cmb/c|, because photon 1's momentum is E/(c) in the +z direction, and photon 2's is E_cmb/(c) in the -z direction.

Wait, no: photon 1's momentum is p1 = (E1/c) in the direction of motion, and photon 2's is p2 = (E2/c) in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is (E1/c - E2/c) in the direction of photon 1.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2. But wait, units are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. So E1 and E2 are in energy units (eV, etc.), and their momenta are p1=E1, p2=E2. But since photon 2 is moving in the opposite direction, p2 is negative. So total momentum is p1 - p2 = E1 - E2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. The condition for production is s >= (2 m_e)^2, so 4 E1 E2 >= 4 (m_e c^2)^2. Wait, but in natural units, m_e is in energy units. So the threshold condition is E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1. So the condition is E1 E2 >= (m_e)^2 / 4. So E1 * E2 >= (0.511 MeV)^2 /4.

Wait, but m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2.

So the product E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2 /4.

So rearranging, E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 E_cmb).

Let me compute that. E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV. Let me convert m_e c^2 to eV. 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 is (511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = approximately (5.11)^2 * 1e10 eV^2 ≈ 26.11e10 eV^2.

So (m_e c^2)^2 /4 is
