Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a wave function of a particle in a tube along the x-axis. They're saying that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait. Oh, right, i is the imaginary unit, sqrt(-1). But when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, no, the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So for the wave function to make sense physically, it has to be normalized. That's the key here. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should be 1.

So first, let me write down the wave function properly. It's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that doesn't look right. Because the wave function ψ(x) usually has both real and imaginary parts. However, in typical cases, the wave function is either real or pure imaginary, but here it's a combination. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, maybe the wave function is given as a complex number, but perhaps the actual form is something else. Wait, the way it's written, (a/sqrt
