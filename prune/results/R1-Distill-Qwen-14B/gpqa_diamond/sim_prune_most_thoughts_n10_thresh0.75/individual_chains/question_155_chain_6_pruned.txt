Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given a specific state. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about uncertainties and operators.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the operator P_z has a matrix form with diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ, and zeros elsewhere. So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because that's usually the case in such problems.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like ΔP_z, is calculated using the formula: ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

Wait, but wait. The state is an eigenstate of P_x. Does that affect anything? Hmm, since P_x and P_z are different operators, the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, so the uncertainty shouldn't be zero. I have to compute the expectation values.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1.

Calculating each component squared: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, (-1/2)^2=1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 =1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, I need to compute <P_z> which is ψ† P_z ψ. And then <P_z²> which is ψ† P_z^2 ψ. Then compute the uncertainty.

Let me write down the matrix P_z. It's a diagonal matrix: [ [ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ħ] ].

So P_z acting on the state ψ would give each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

But since I'm calculating the expectation values, perhaps it's easier to express the state in terms of the eigenbasis of P_z, since the matrix is diagonal in that basis. But wait, our state is already in that basis because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is |ψ> = a |+z> + b |mid_z> + c |-z>, where |+z> is [1,0,0]^T, |mid_z> is [0,1,0]^T, and |-z> is [0,0,1]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the state ψ is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ), so it's a linear combination of the three basis vectors. So |ψ> = (-1/2)|+z> + (1/sqrt(2)) |mid_z> + (-1/2)|-z>.

Now, the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of |coefficients|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is straightforward. Since:

<P_z> = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * (0) + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

So let's compute |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

a is -1/2, so |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

b is 1/sqrt(2), so |b|^2 = 1/2.

c is -1/2, so
