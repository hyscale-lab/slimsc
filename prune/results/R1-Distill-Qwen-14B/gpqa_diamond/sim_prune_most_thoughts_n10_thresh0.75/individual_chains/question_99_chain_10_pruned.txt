Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question provides information from both FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at each piece of data and think about what they mean.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid, right? Because in alcohols, the O-H peak is usually a bit less broad, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH from something else, but the other significant peak in IR is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, putting those together, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have both the O-H and C=O groups. Alternatively, could it be an ester or ketone? Well, the broad peak suggests an O-H, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid than esters or ketones, which don't have O-H groups. So likely, the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that several peaks are observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, that means there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, like in alkenes. So, no vinyl groups. That rules out any possibility of structures with double bonds, but all the options given seem to have branching but no double bonds, so maybe that's not an issue here.

Another important point from the NMR: two specific signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns and how they arise.

In NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons will split the signal into a multiplet. The number of neighboring protons determines
