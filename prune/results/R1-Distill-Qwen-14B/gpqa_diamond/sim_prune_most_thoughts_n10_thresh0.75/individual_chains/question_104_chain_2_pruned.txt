Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet tugs the star towards us, the spectral lines shift blue, and when it's moving away, they shift red. The size of this shift relates to the star's velocity, which is linked to the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune. So both planets are Neptune-sized, and the stars are solar-type.

The detected shifts are given: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but those shifts are periodic, right? So the shift is related to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/ something? Maybe I should think about the simplified version. Oh right, for small masses (like planets compared to stars), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since both are circular orbits, e=0, so (1-e²)^(1/2) is 1.

So the formula simplifies. Let me recall. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, another formula I remember is that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the orbital radius. Or maybe it's proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) ), since the velocity relates to the circular velocity.

Wait, let's get back. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but sin i is 1 for simplicity, as we don't know the inclination, but the problem doesn't mention it, so I think we can assume sin i is same for both planets, or maybe it's canceled out in the ratio).

But the problem says the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune). So M_p is same for both, and M_star is same for both.

So K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). Wait, let me think again about the formula. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait
