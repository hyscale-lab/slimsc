Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still present, and he measures their mean free path as λ1. Then, when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1?

Wait, the mean free path... I remember that the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh right, the formula is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the mean collision diameter. So λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure because n is proportional to pressure (since PV = nRT, so n = P/(kT)). Wait, does that make sense?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P), where P is the pressure. So if pressure decreases, λ increases. Because if P goes down, the denominator gets smaller, making λ bigger. Makes sense because lower pressure means fewer molecules, so they don't collide as often, so the average path between collisions is longer.

In the initial state, when the vacuum is created, the pressure is ultra-low, so λ1 is probably quite large. But then, when the electron beam is turned on, what happens?

Oh, right, the electron beam itself might cause some effects. One thing I remember is that the electron beam can cause gas molecules to ionize or even get ejected from the sample compartment. Or maybe the beam heats the molecules. Wait, no, the problem says the temperature remains the same, so that's not the reason.

Another possibility is that the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be excited or ionized. So when the beam is on, gas particles might become charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly with the electric fields from the microscope, perhaps getting accelerated or deflected more. Or, more importantly, charged particles might stick to the walls of the sample compartment or other surfaces, effectively removing them from the gas phase.

Wait, but if the gas particles are ionized, they might form ions which can be removed by the vacuum pumps more efficiently. Or maybe the ions are drawn towards the walls due to electric fields, which could reduce the number density of the gas in the compartment. Alternatively, the beam could cause the gas to be pumped out more quickly.

But in this case, Mike observed that the mean free path changes. So the number of particles (n) changed. Because mean free path depends on n, if n decreases, λ increases. Hmm, but wait: the initial state had some gas, and after starting the beam, maybe the number of gas molecules decreases. So n becomes lower, which would make λ2 larger than λ1.

Wait, but wait. The initial mean free path was λ1 under the ultra-high vacuum. So when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being further pumped out, reducing the
