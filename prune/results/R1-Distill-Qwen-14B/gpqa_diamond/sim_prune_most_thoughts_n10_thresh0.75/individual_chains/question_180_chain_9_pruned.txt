Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy involves charges and the distances between them. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that. The setup is a bit specific: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about finding the electric potential energy of the system. Because when charges are placed near each other, they have potential energy due to their positions. The minimum energy would probably be when the configuration is the most stable, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into it. Wait, maybe the problem is just about calculating the potential energy in the given setup regardless of whether it's the minimum or not. Or perhaps the minimum occurs under certain conditions.

Wait, but the setup is fixed. Let me think again. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, which has another charge. So each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. Oh wait, because the 13th is fixed, and the others are at 2 m from it. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P. But what about their distances from each other?

The problem says the other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. Oh, but it doesn't say anything about their distances from each other. So I suppose they can be anywhere on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But since they're identical charges, they'd repel each other. So in the minimum energy state, they'd be as far apart as possible. Wait, but since their positions are constrained to be 2 meters from
