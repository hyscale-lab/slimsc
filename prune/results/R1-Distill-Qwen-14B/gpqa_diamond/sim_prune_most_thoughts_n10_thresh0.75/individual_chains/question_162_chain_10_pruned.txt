Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy only. So this is a 2D spacetime, probably a surface in some higher-dimensional space. Pseudosphere, right? Oh, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, often used in hyperbolic geometry.

The question is about the area of this pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but wait. I remember that the area of a pseudosphere depends on its radius. The formula for the area of a pseudosphere is 4πr², but wait, no, isn't that the area of a regular sphere? Or is it different for pseudospheres?

Wait, no, for a regular sphere, the area is 4πr², yes. But a pseudosphere is a bit different because it's non-compact and has infinite area. Or maybe not? Wait, no, pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent but with finite area. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. Its geometry is hyperbolic. The metric given here looks like a hyperbolic metric. The general form for hyperbolic space in 2D is ds² = dr² + (
