Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH problems, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide). The options are given, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

First, I should remember what each of these substances does. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, mixing acids and bases will likely involve a neutralization reaction.

I think the approach here is to find the total moles of H+ ions from the acids and the total moles of OH- ions from the base, then see which is in excess. The excess will determine whether the solution is acidic or basic, and from there, I can find the pH.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine the net moles of H+ or OH- after neutralization.
3. Use the total volume to find concentration.
4. Calculate pH or pOH based on the excess ions.

Starting with each component:

1. **CH3COOH**: It's a weak acid, but since it doesn't dissociate completely, but maybe in this case, since it's being mixed with a strong acid and base, the H+ from it might be negligible compared to HCl. Or wait, maybe not. Let's think: HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- completely.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH^-.

So, first, calculate the moles of each:

- Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity × Volume (in liters)
0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

- Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

- Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, the moles of OH- are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let me think about the neutralization. Acids and bases will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

But wait, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But since CH3COOH is a weak acid, its H+ contribution is less compared to strong acid HCl. However, when mixed with a strong base, maybe the strong acid will donate all its H+.

Wait, but in this case, the HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, giving 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3COOH, being weak, won't fully dissociate, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it doesn't matter much because the strong base will react with all the H+ available, including from acetic acid.

Wait, but no. The reaction between H+ and OH- is straightforward. The total H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when it's in solution, it doesn't release much H+. But when mixed with HCl, which is a strong acid, the HCl will provide a lot of H+ ions, potentially pushing the dissociation of CH3COOH further. But in this case, since we have a strong base as well, perhaps all the H+ (from all sources) will react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it as:

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes less H+. But in a mixture with a strong base, perhaps the strong acid's H+ reacts first, followed by the weak acid.

Wait, maybe I should think about the net reaction.

Total H+ from all acids: HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles contribute H+. CH3COOH is weak, so maybe it contributes some x moles of H+. But wait, when you mix a strong acid and a weak acid, the H+ from both contribute. However, when a base is present, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

But perhaps, since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely ionize, providing 0.08 moles H+. The CH3COOH might contribute some H+, but when you mix it with a base, the H+ from CH3COOH might react less because some of it is neutralized by OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from the base, then subtract to find the net H+ or OH-.

So:

Total H+ = HCl contribution + CH3COOH's contribution.

But wait, for HCl, it's a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles are H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its H+ contribution is less. The formula for a weak acid is Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], but in solution with a strong base, perhaps some of the H+ from CH3COOH is neutralized.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to first calculate all the H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Let me proceed step by step.

Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH: Let me think. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. The dissociation is: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. But when you mix it with HCl, the H+ from HCl will suppress the dissociation of acetic acid (Le Chatelier's principle). So the concentration of H+ from acetic acid would be very low, but not zero.

However, when mixing with a strong base, perhaps the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH-.

Wait, but perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture, considering all sources.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let's say it's x. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will fully ionize and the H+ from CH3COOH would be negligible? Or should I calculate it?

Alternatively, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl because HCl is a strong acid and contributes much more H+. So perhaps I can approximate the H+ from CH3COOH as negligible in this case.

Wait, let's see: HCl is 0.08 mol, CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so H+ is 0.08. Acetic acid will donate some H+, but perhaps it's better to calculate it.

Wait, but when mixing, the total volume is 500 + 400 +300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Wait, but when you mix HCl (a strong acid) with CH3COOH (weak acid), the H+ from CH3COOH will be minimal because the strong acid makes the solution more H+ rich, thus reducing the dissociation of acetic acid.

But when you have a strong base in the mix, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

So, perhaps the correct way is:

Total H+ available = H+ from HCl + H+ from CH3COOH.

Total OH- available = OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, if the OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic; if H+ is in excess, acidic.

So:

H+ total = 0.08 (from HCl) + (some small value from CH3COOH).

But perhaps I should ignore the CH3COOH's H+ because it's a weak acid, and in the presence of a strong base, maybe it doesn't contribute significantly. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of excess OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

First, let's calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids (HCl and CH3COOH), and total moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid: 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid: Let's calculate its H+.

The dissociation of CH3COOH is:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The initial concentration of CH3COOH is 0.1 M in 0.5 L, so 0.05 moles.

Ka = 1.8e-5.

But considering the presence of H+ from HCl, which is much higher, the dissociation of CH3COOH is suppressed. So, the H+ from CH3COOH would be very small, perhaps negligible compared to HCl's H+.

But to be precise, let's calculate it.

The concentration in the mixture:

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

The concentration of CH3COOH after mixing is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.06667 M.

So, the initial [H+] from HCl is about 0.06667 M.

The H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using Ka.

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] → [H+] = Ka * [HA]/[A-].

Wait, but in the presence of a strong acid, the H+ concentration is much higher than what the weak acid would produce. So, the dissociation of CH3COOH would be minimal, and the [H+] from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl's H+.

So, perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, the H+ from CH3COOH can be ignored. So, the total H+ is approximately 0.08 mol.

But wait, when you mix the solution with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

So, let's calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total = 0.08 (from HCl) + x (from CH3COOH).

But as discussed, x is negligible, so H+ ≈ 0.08 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 × 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, total H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

So, OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

So, the solution will have excess OH- ions.

The total volume is 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.10 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.08333 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.08333) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 12.92.

But wait, none of the options are 12.92. The options are A)12.62, B)1.38, C)8.92, D)8.68.

Hmm, that's a problem. Either my assumption about CH3COOH's H+ is wrong, or I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I should account for the H+ from CH3COOH more carefully.

Let me re-calculate considering the H+ from CH3COOH.

The total H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

But wait, in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH isn't neutralized, but the base will neutralize all H+ available, including from CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the net H+ after considering all reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that all H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, total H+ available = 0.08 (HCl) + (some from CH3COOH).

But how much is that some?

Wait, the solution is getting complicated, but perhaps I can model it.

Let me consider that the CH3COOH contributes some H+.

But since the solution is being mixed with a strong base, which has a lot of OH-, let's think about the neutralization.

The OH- will react with all available H+.

So, total H+ = HCl's H+ (0.08) + CH3COOH's H+ (x).

Total OH- is 0.18.

If H+ + OH- = 0.08 + x.

If the sum is less than 0.18, then excess OH- remains.

But I need to calculate x.

But x depends on the concentration of CH3COOH after mixing.

So, let's calculate the new concentration of CH3COOH in the mixture.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

So, concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Ka = 1.8e-5.

The dissociation equation is:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The initial H+ comes from both HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH.

Wait, but the HCl is a strong acid, which will contribute a significant amount of H+.

So, the initial [H+] is dominated by HCl.

[H+] from HCl is 0.08 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.06667 M.

Because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully ionize, so [H+] is 0.06667 M from HCl.

Now, the dissociation of CH3COOH is minimal compared to this, so the [H+] from CH3COOH can be approximated as:

Ka = ( [H+]^2 ) / ( [CH3COOH] )

Wait, no. Because in the presence of a strong acid, the H+ is already high, so the dissociation of acetic acid is suppressed.

But the exact [H+] would be the sum of H+ from HCl and the small amount from CH3COOH.

But for simplicity, perhaps it's acceptable to approximate that the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, so [H+] ≈ 0.06667 M.

But when OH- is added, it will react with H+.

So, the total H+ is 0.08 mol, and OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Wait, that brings me back to the same conclusion as before, so the pH would be around 12.92, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: maybe I should not ignore the H+ from CH3COOH when calculating the neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH contributes a little to the total H+.

So, let me calculate the H+ from CH3COOH in the presence of HCl.

The presence of H+ from HCl will suppress the dissociation of CH3COOH, but some will still dissociate.

So, using the expression:

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]

We can write:

[H+] = sqrt( Ka * [HA] )

But in reality, the [H+] is dominated by HCl, so [H+] ≈ 0.06667 M.

So, [A-] from CH3COOH would be:

[A-] = (Ka * [HA]) / [H+] )

= (1.8e-5 * 0.04167) / 0.06667 ≈ ?

Calculating that:

1.8e-5 * 0.04167 ≈ 7.5e-7

Divide by 0.06667: 7.5e-7 / 0.06667 ≈ 1.125e-5.

So, [A-] ≈ 1.125e-5 M.

But wait, I'm trying to find the [H+], but we already assumed [H+]=0.06667 M from HCl. So the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible.

So, the total H+ is 0.08 mol.

But the OH- is 0.18 mol. So, net OH- is 0.10 mol.

Concentration of OH- is 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.08333 M.

pOH = -log(0.08333) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made an incorrect assumption.

Alternative idea: Maybe I should include the H+ from CH3COOH when calculating the neutralization.

Let me compute the H+ from CH3COOH more accurately.

In the mixture, the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

The initial H+ is from HCl: 0.08 mol in 1.2 L → 0.06667 M.

The dissociation of CH3COOH is:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

Let the change be +x for H+ and CH3COO^-.

So, initial concentrations:

[H+] = 0.06667 M.

[CH3COOH] = 0.04167 M.

Change:

[H+] increases by x → 0.06667 + x.

[CH3COO^-] increases by x → x.

So, the Ka expression is:

Ka = ( [H+][A-] ) / [HA] )

1.8e-5 = ( (0.06667 + x) * x ) / (0.04167 - x )

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.06667 and 0.04167, we can approximate:

(0.06667 * x ) / 0.04167 ≈ 1.8e-5.

Solving for x:

x ≈ (1.8e-5 * 0.04167) / 0.06667

≈ (7.5e-7) / 0.06667 ≈ 1.125e-5 M.

So, x ≈ 1.125e-5 M → negligible compared to 0.06667 M.

So, the total [H+] is approximately 0.06667 M.

Thus, the moles of H+ are 0.06667 * 1.2 L = 0.08 mol. So my initial calculation holds.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol → excess OH- is 0.10 mol.

Thus, [OH-] = 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.08333 M.

pOH = -log(0.08333) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I messed up in the calculation of moles.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Let me recheck the moles:

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol. Correct.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Correct.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Correct.

Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-. Correct.

So, H+ is 0.08 + negligible from CH3COOH.

So, H+ and OH- reacting:

0.08 H+ + 0.18 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.

So, [OH-] is 0.10 / 1.2 L = 0.08333 M.

But why is the calculated pH not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps I should not ignore the H+ from CH3COOH, because when the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is in excess, it can react with the CH3COO^- ions.

Wait, wait! Maybe I should consider that the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid's conjugate base.

Let me think: if you have excess OH-, it will neutralize any weak acids. So, perhaps the OH- will neutralize the CH3COO^- ions, converting them back into CH3COOH.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is in excess. So, after the initial neutralization of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, the remaining OH- will react with the conjugate base of CH3COOH.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. H+ from HCl (0.08) and CH3COOH (x ≈ 1.125e-5) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18).

2. Total H+ available is approximately 0.08 + 1.125e-5 ≈ 0.080001125 mol.

3. OH- available is 0.18 mol.

4. They react: 0.080001125 H+ + 0.080001125 OH- → H2O.

5. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.080001125 = 0.099998875 ≈ 0.10 mol.

6. Now, the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COO^- ions.

Because OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the CH3COO^-? Wait, no: CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, OH- is a stronger base, so it can't deprotonate it; wait, no, actually, OH- can't deprotonate CH3COO^-. Because CH3COO^- is a weak base. So, OH- is a stronger base and can't react with it.

Wait, wait, that's incorrect. OH- is a stronger base than CH3COO^-. So, OH- is less willing to accept a proton than CH3COO^-.

Wait, no. Actually, the reaction would require that OH- (a strong base) abstracts a proton from CH3COO^-.

Wait, but CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it's a weak base. OH- is a stronger base (from a strong acid), so it can't abstract a proton from CH3COO^-.

Wait, that's correct. So, CH3COO^- is a weak base and OH- is a stronger base. So, the reaction would not occur. So, the OH- won't react with CH3COO^-.

Wait, then perhaps only the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH neutralizes the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and any excess OH- remains in solution, making it basic.

So, the pH would be determined by the excess OH-.

But then why is the pH I calculated (12.92) not among the options?

Looking at the options, A is 12.62, which is lower than 12.92.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine my assumption.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, HCl is 400 mL of 0.2 M. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Correct.

Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18. Correct.

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Correct.

The total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) + (x from CH3COOH).

But x is from CH3COOH dissociation. So, as I calculated earlier, x is about 1.125e-5 M, but in terms of moles, x is 1.125e-5 * 1.2 L ≈ 1.35e-5 mol. Which is negligible compared to 0.08.

So, total H+ is 0.08 + 1.35e-5 ≈ 0.08000135 mol.

OH- is 0.18 mol. So, after neutralization, remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08000135 = 0.09999865 mol.

So, [OH-] is 0.09999865 / 1.2 ≈ 0.083332 M.

pOH is -log(0.083332) ≈ 1.08.

pH is 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

But options don't have that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the H+ from CH3COOH isn't negligible because the solution's pH is high enough that some of CH3COOH is deprotonated.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. CH3COOH is an acid; in a basic solution, it would deprotonate, releasing more OH-? No, that's not right. In a basic solution, the OH- would react with the H+ from CH3COOH, but if all H+ is neutralized, then the CH3COOH would be in its deprotonated form.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the amount of OH- that reacts with the H+ from CH3COOH, and then see if any OH- remains.

Wait, let's think step by step:

1. First, H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol). So they neutralize 0.08 mol of OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

2. Then, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH can only donate 0.05 mol of H+ (since it's a weak acid, but in the presence of OH-).

Wait, but the presence of OH- would deprotonate CH3COOH to form CH3COO^- and H2O.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the amount of OH- that can react with CH3COOH is limited by the moles of CH3COOH, which is 0.05 mol.

So, OH- after step 1 is 0.10 mol.

CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

Thus, the OH- after reacting with CH3COOH is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, now, the total OH- is 0.05 mol.

Now, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Which matches option A.

So, that's the correct approach.

Wait, let me go through that again.

Step 1: H+ from HCl (0.08) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18), neutralizing 0.08 mol of OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 mol.

Step 2: The remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH can donate up to 0.05 mol of H+.

So, each mole of CH3COOH can neutralize one mole of OH-.

Thus, 0.05 mol of OH- reacts with CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol of OH-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 → option A.

Ah, so I see where I went wrong earlier. I didn't account for the fact that the remaining OH- would react with the CH3COOH, neutralizing some of it and reducing the excess OH-.

So, the correct answer is 12.62 → option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH₃COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     The dissociation of CH₃COOH is minimal compared to the strong acid HCl, but it contributes a small amount of \( \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization reaction between acids and base:**
   - The \( \text{H}^+ \) ions from HCl and CH₃COOH react with OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂:  
     \[
     \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from HCl}) + x \, \text{mol} \, (\text{from CH₃COOH}) \).  
     Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, its contribution of \( \text{H}^+ \) is negligible compared to HCl, so total \( \text{H}^+ \approx 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - After neutralization, the remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
   - CH₃COOH is present in \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), so it neutralizes \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻ and pH:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).
   - pOH = \( -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
