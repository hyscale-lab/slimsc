Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about quantum mechanics and uncertainties.

The uncertainty principle tells us that the uncertainty in an observable is related to the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So the formula should be ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, right. So I need to compute both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation values might not be straightforward.

The state given is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down. So |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Let me check the matrix for P_z. Oh right, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So the matrix looks like:

[ ħ    0     0  ]
[ 0    0     0  ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So when I multiply P_z with |ψ⟩, each component will be multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩. So ψ† P_z ψ. Since ψ has real components (I think), the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ψ† P_z ψ is the sum over each component: (ψ†)_i (P_z)_i_i (ψ)_i.

So the first component: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) → (1/4) ħ.
Second component: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) → 0.
Third component: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → (1/4) ħ * (-1) because (-1/2)*(-ħ) is (ħ/2), and then times (-1/2) again. Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

Wait no, each term is (ψ†)_i * (P_z)_i_i * (ψ)_i. So for i=1: (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.
i=2: (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) = 0.
i=3: (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) → Hmm, let's see. (-1/2)*(-ħ) is (ħ/2). Multiply by (-1/2) again: (ħ/2)*(-1/2) = -ħ/4. So sum all three terms:

(1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Because 1/4 ħ minus 1/4 ħ cancels out.

Wait, that's interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Then what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

P_z squared is P_z multiplied by itself. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² matrix is [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ( - ħ )^2 ] → which is [ ħ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ² ].

So to find ⟨P_z²⟩, it's ψ† P_z² ψ again. Using the same ψ vector.

So compute each component:

i=1: (-1/2) * ħ² * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ².
i=2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.
i=3: (-1/2) * ħ² * (-1/2) → (1/4) ħ².

Adding them up: 1/4 ħ² + 0 + 1/4 ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2. Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = (ħ)/√2.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations. Because sometimes when you think you're done, you might have missed something.

Wait, the state vector is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

For ⟨P_z⟩, each term is (component)² * corresponding P_z element.

Wait, but in the calculation, I multiplied (ψ†)_i * (P_z)_i_i * (ψ)_i.

Wait, no, that's correct because when you do ψ† M ψ, it's the sum over i of (ψ†)_i (M)_i_i (ψ)_i, because M is diagonal. So yes, that's correct.

So for each i,
