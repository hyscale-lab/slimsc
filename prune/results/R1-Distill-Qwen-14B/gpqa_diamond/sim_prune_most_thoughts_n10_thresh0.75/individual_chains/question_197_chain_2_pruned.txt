Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find out the final product. The options are four different compounds, so my job is to figure out what X is and then determine what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

First, let's look at the data provided: the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X. I'll need to analyze these to deduce the structure of X.

Starting with the IR data:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's another peak at around 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. O-H in a carbonyl compound is likely a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1720 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid's carbonyl, which is usually around 1700-1725. Hmm, but if it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone? Wait, but in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a singlet. That's really high up, so it's probably an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So the 1720 cm-1 is the C=O from the carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would usually show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. The 3400–2500 cm-1 could be that. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, but then why the C=O? Hmm, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound has both an acid and an ester? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think. If the carbonyl is around 1720, it's lower than a typical acid, which is 1700-1725. So maybe an ester? Because esters' carbonyls are around 1740-1720. Or maybe a ketone? Wait, but ketones are usually around 1700-1750, but their peaks can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, but I don't think so because the NMR doesn't show a peak that would indicate Cl, and the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, which is more about elimination or other reactions.

Wait, let me check the NMR data next. Maybe that can help.

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in D2O, the -OH would exchange and disappear, but the peak is present, so maybe it's not exchanged or maybe it's a broad peak
