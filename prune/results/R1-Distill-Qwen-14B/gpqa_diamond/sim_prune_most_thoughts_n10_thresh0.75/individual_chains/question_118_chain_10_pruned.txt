Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I need to figure out the major outcome and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Cyclopentenol is a five-membered ring with an double bond and -OH group. So, cyclopent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. And since it's an enol, the double bond is adjacent to the hydroxyl group.

Wait, enol structure. The enol has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl on carbon 2? Or is it on carbon 1? Oh wait, no, the enol form has the double bond adjacent to the hydroxyl. So, for cyclopent-1-enol, the structure would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the OH group on carbon 1. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2 because in the keto form, the carbonyl is on C1, so the enol would
