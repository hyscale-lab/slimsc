Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's been a while since I did these kinds of calculations. But let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide). The options are A to D, with various pH values. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, so first, I think I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. If there's excess H+ or OH-, that will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll also fully dissociate.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each component in each solution.
2. Find the total moles of H+ from the acids.
3. Find the total moles of OH- from the base.
4. Subtract to see if H+ or OH- is in excess.
5. Then, calculate the concentration of the excess H+ or OH-.
6. Finally, determine the pH using the concentration.

Let me start with the moles.

First solution: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+ ions. But wait, I'm not sure if I need to consider its dissociation here. Because when mixing with strong acids and bases, maybe the strong ones will dominate. Hmm, but wait, let's think. The HCl is a strong acid, so it'll contribute a lot of H+ ions. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will contribute OH- ions. So perhaps the CH3COOH's contribution is negligible in the presence of such strong acid and base. Or maybe not, depending on the amounts.

Wait, but first, let's calculate the moles from each component.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL (0.4 L) × 0.2 M = 0.08 mol HCl. Since HCl is strong, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL (0.3 L) × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH
