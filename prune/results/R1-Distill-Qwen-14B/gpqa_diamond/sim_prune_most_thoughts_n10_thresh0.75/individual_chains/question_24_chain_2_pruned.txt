Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question involves mixtures X and Y, which undergo some reactions. I'll try to break down each part.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds because alkenes can react with bromine. So the two liquids in X must have double bonds, maybe alkenes or something else with unsaturation.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Oh, wait, the question says it's a result of disproportionation. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, maybe something like converting an alkene into something else with multiple bonds. Or perhaps, considering the products... Wait, but what's the result? Y is a mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have double bonds, or maybe the double bonds are saturated now.

So if X had double bonds and Y doesn't, maybe X was an alkene and Y is something else. Wait, but it's a disproportionation reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when alkenes are hydrogenated, they add H2 across the double bond. But that's hydrogenation, not disproportionation. Oh wait, in this case, the treatment is with platinum when heated, so maybe it's a catalytic reaction. But wait, the question says it's a disproportionation. So perhaps X is an alkyne? Because when you hydrogenate an alkyne, you can get different products depending on the conditions. Wait, but let's think.

Wait, no, the question says that treating X with Pt and heating causes a disproportionation, leading to Y. So perhaps X has a functional group that can undergo disproportionation. For example, maybe X is something like an alkyne, which can be hydrogenated in different ways. Or maybe X contains an element in a particular oxidation state that can be both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, another angle: if X is an alkene (with a double bond) and Y becomes something without double bonds, but via a disproportionation. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think about what else could cause
