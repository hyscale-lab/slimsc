Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. So, the operator is Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h divided by 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix.

The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So writing that out, S looks like:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. And then choosing the correct statement among the options A to D.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - aI) = 0. So, for a 2x2 matrix, that should be straightforward.

Let me write the matrix Ay. Since S is as above, multiplying by c:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So each element is multiplied by c. So the matrix is:

[ 0          , -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , 0           ]

Now, the eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I ) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a , -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Let me compute that. So determinant = a² - [ (i * (-i)) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

i*(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So this simplifies to a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²) ), so a² - h²/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving for a: a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, wait. Because h/(4π) is c, so the eigenvalues are ±c. So a = ± c = ± h/(4π). 

So the eigenvalues are real numbers. Because the problem is about angular momentum components, I thought maybe the eigenvalues would be purely real or purely imaginary. But here, they're real. So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues we found are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are just real numbers. So B is also wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Let me think. The intrinsic angular momentum A is like spin-1/2, so A² would have eigenvalues (ħ²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalue (ħ²)(3/4) = 3ħ²/4. The eigenfunctions of A² are the same as those for any component, because A² is the sum of squares of all components. So if φ is an eigenvector of Ay, then it is also an eigenvector of A². Because for angular momentum, the simultaneous eigenstates are for A² and one component, say Az. But in this case, Ay's eigenfunctions might be different from Az's. So if Ay and A² share eigenvectors, then option C is correct. Or wait, let me think. The eigenfunctions of A² are the same as those of any component? No, because A² commutes with each component. So the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as the eigenfunctions of, say, Az. But Ay and Az don't commute, so they don't share eigenvectors. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, would it also be an eigenstate of A²? Hmm. Because A² commutes with Ay, so if Ay |φ> = a |φ>, then A² |φ> would be (a² + something?) Wait, no. Wait, A² is A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2. Oh, but for spin 1/2 particles, if you have a state that's an eigenstate of Ay, then when you apply A², since [A², Ay] = 0, the state must also be an eigenstate of A². Because if you have [A², Ay] = 0, then A² can be applied to the eigenstate of Ay and it'll just multiply by the eigenvalue for A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Because Ay and Az don't commute, so a state that's an eigenstate of Ay isn't necessarily an eigenstate of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That would make C correct. But wait, the option says "could" be eigenfunctions, not that they are. So perhaps the statement is correct. So C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which would be the eigenbasis. So if the eigenfunctions form a basis, then yes. But matrix operators have eigenfunctions as their basis, especially if they're diagonal in that basis. So D says that, so it's correct? But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Hmm.

Wait, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. So the eigenfunctions form the basis for Ay. Well, for any Hermitian operator, the eigenvectors form a basis (assuming they're complete). So D might be correct.

Wait, but I thought that statement C is correct. Let me review.

The problem: the options are statements about what is correct during the calculation.

So for the eigenvalues, we found a = ± h/(4π). So looking again at the options:

Option A: eigenvalue imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is way off. So incorrect.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2. No, our eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² and Ay commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. Well, in a way, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so D is correct. But the statement is a bit ambiguous. It says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay". Usually, the basis is any set of vectors that can span the space, not necessarily the eigenbasis. So D's statement might not be correct or might be, depending on interpretation.

Wait, but the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space (e.g., for a 2x2, any two linearly independent eigenvectors form a basis). So D's statement is correct. But the question is, which of the four is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but let's think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement will I consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, I would realize that the eigenvalues are real, which rules out A and B. Then, for the eigenvectors, I might find their properties.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

For a = h/(4π), the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a , -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

Which becomes:

[ -h/(4π), -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -h/(4π) ]

To find the eigenvector, we can row reduce this matrix. Let me write the equations.

Equation 1: (-a) ψ₁ + [ -(i h)/(4π) ] ψ₂ = 0

Equation 2: [ (i h)/(4π) ] ψ₁ + (-a) ψ₂ = 0

But since a = h/(4π), substituting:

Equation 1: - (h/(4π)) ψ₁ - (i h/(4π)) ψ₂ = 0 → multiply both sides by 4π/h: 
-ψ₁ - i ψ₂ = 0 → ψ₁ = -i ψ₂.

Similarly, equation 2: (i h/(4π)) ψ₁ - (h/(4π)) ψ₂ = 0 → same as equation 1.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [ -i , 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the same process leads to ψ₁ = i ψ₂, so eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are in the form [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of spin components are usually represented as spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction. So for Ay, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, which are linear combinations of the basis vectors.

Now, considering option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As discussed earlier, since [A², Ay] = 0, they share eigenfunctions. So φ is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct.

As for Az, which is the z-component of angular momentum, since [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis for a 2x2 matrix, which is typically the computational basis, say |0> and |1>. The eigenvectors form a different basis, which is diagonalizing Ay. So the eigenfunctions form the eigenbasis for Ay, which is a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct. But the question is whether the statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps the correct statements are C and D. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which I think is correct, as the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space in which Ay is diagonal. So both C and D could be correct, but I need to read the options carefully.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So I have to choose the correct option.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, does it mean that the matrix is diagonal in the eigenbasis? Yes, because when you have eigenvectors, the matrix is diagonal in that basis. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix.

So both options C and D seem correct, but wait, looking at the options, what do they say.

Wait, the problem is that I have to choose one correct option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me quickly recap.

Eigenvalues of Ay are a = ±h/(4π). So real, not complex. So A and B are wrong.

For option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (yes, because they commute), but not of Az (since they don't commute). So C is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay. I think that's correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I have to choose between C and D.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct. Because the matrix operator's eigenfunctions form a basis in which it's diagonal, so they are the basis functions.

Wait, but the question says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, perhaps it's a wording issue. Basis functions of the matrix operator would be the standard basis, but I think that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, no. The matrix representation of an operator depends on the basis. So for the standard basis, the matrix is as given. In the eigenbasis, the matrix would be diagonal. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix operator. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the correctness during the calculation. So when you're finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you're working in a particular basis, which is the eigenbasis of Ay. So D's statement is true.

But then, conflicting with that, the correct statements could be C and D. But in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So if the correct answer is C, then D is incorrect. Or if D is correct, perhaps C is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again about option D. The matrix operator's basis functions: I think the way the question is phrased, it's about the basis in which Ay is represented. But the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's own matrix. So in the standard basis, the matrix is given as 2x2. In the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the matrix operator in that basis. So D is correct.

But earlier, I thought that C is correct. Hmm. Or perhaps C is not correct.

Wait, because A² is the sum of squares of the components, including Ay. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's an eigenstate of A² as well. So C is correct.

So the possible correct options are C and D, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Only one is correct.

Wait, another thought: the eigenfunctions φ are the same as the eigenfunctions of A² because they share the same set of eigenstates. So C is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what each option says.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute, so the eigenfunctions are not shared.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix operator is given in the standard basis, not in the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix as given. If you change the basis to the eigenbasis, the matrix would be diagonal. So in the given matrix, the basis is the standard one, not the eigenfunctions. So option D is incorrect.

Ah, that's a key point. The matrix operator is given in the standard basis (probably computational basis, like |+x> and |+y> or something else). So the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the given matrix. So option D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct statement is C.

So the answer is option C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues \( a \), solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-a & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

Solving for \( a \), we find:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are real: \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_1 \\
\psi_2
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

From the equations, \( \psi_1 = -i \psi_2 \), so the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
-i \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Similarly, for \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
i \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real: \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

- **Option B**: Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space in which \( A_y \) is diagonal, but the matrix operator \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
