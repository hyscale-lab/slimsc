Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle in a given potential. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks a bit complicated. I remember that potentials in two dimensions can sometimes be solved by separating into radial and angular parts, but I'm not sure if this one will be that straightforward.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe I can rewrite the potential to see if it simplifies into something familiar.

Let me do that substitution. So V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r²*(1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that: 3/2 times 1/2 is 3/4. So the second term is (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the whole potential now is (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Adding the first two terms: 1/2 is 0.5, 3/4 is 0.75. So 0.5 + 0.75 = 1.25, which is 5/4. So V(r,θ) becomes (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be separated into a sum of functions depending only on r and a function depending only on θ. Because in quantum mechanics, separable potentials are easier to solve since we can use variables separation.

Looking again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

But I don't think that helps much. Wait, maybe I can write the potential as a sum of terms that depend only on r and terms that depend on θ. Let me see: the first term is (1/2)k r^2, which is purely radial. The second term is (3/2 k r^2 cos^2θ) which can be rewritten using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So that term becomes (3k/4) r² (1 + cos2θ). So the total potential is (1/2 k + 3k/4) r² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Wait, 1/2 k is 2k/4, so adding 2k/4 + 3k/4 gives 5k/4. So V(r,θ) =
