Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So the question is about which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view, which would affect which one they choose to observe.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the formula for the transit probability is something like R_planet squared divided by (R_star + R_planet)^2 times the impact parameter. But wait, I might be mixing some terms here. Alternatively, I think the main factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, or something like that.

Wait, no, let me recall. The transit probability, if I'm not mistaken, is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)Â² * (1 / (d)), where d is the impact parameter. But wait, no, that's not right. Oh, right, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, multiplied by the likelihood that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. 

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that we see a transit) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s)) / (1 + (a_p / R_s)) ) ), but no, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, another approach: the
