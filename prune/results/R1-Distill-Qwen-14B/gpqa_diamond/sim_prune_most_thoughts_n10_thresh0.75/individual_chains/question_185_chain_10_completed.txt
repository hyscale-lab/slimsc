Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is a vector of Pauli matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ·n would be like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz, right? So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix, since each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and n is a unit vector, meaning its components squared add up to 1.

Eigenvalues... Oh yeah, for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are the trace over 2 and minus the same, or something like that. Wait, no, I think the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is their product. Alternatively, for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (a+d)λ + (ad - bc) = 0.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way here. Oh right! The Pauli matrices have a property that σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix. Wait, no, σ · n squared would be (σ · n)^2. Let me compute that.

So, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. When you expand this, each σi squared is I (the identity matrix), and the cross terms are terms like σi σj, which are anti-commuting if i≠j. But when squared, the cross terms will involve σi σj + σj σi, which for i≠j is zero because they anti-commute. Wait, no, wait. Wait, σi σj = i ε_{ijk} σk, but when you square the sum, you have σi σi (which is I) for each term, plus the cross terms.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that (σ · n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + terms that involve σi σj for i≠j. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1, so (σ·n)^2 = I + (sum σi σj for i≠j). Or wait, no, actually, (σ·n) is a sum, and its square would be (σ·n)(σ·n) = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). Let's compute each term:

Each term is n_i n_j σi σj. When i=j, σi^2 is I, so that's n_i^2 I. When i≠j, σi σj = i ε_{ijk} σk, but when you sum over all i and j, including i≠j, you get terms that sum to zero because each σi σj appears once as positive and once as negative, perhaps.

Wait, I might be complicating this. Alternatively, I remember that for any unit vector n, the square of σ · n is the identity matrix. Because (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σi σj. But since n is a unit vector, sum n_i^2 = 1. And the cross terms sum to zero because σi σj + σj σi = 0 for i≠j. Wait, no, σi σj + σj σi = 2 δ_{ij} I, which is 2I when i=j, zero otherwise. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, if you have σi σj = i ε_{ijk} σk when i≠j, right? But when you compute (σ·n)^2, you get sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σi σj. So when i=j, it's n_i^2 σi^2 = n_i^2 I. When i≠j, it's n_i n_j σi σj. So the sum is sum_i n_i^2 I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σi σj.

But σi σj = -σj σi, so when you add σi σj and σj σi, you get zero. Wait, but in the expansion, each term σi σj appears once, and σj σi appears once when i and j are swapped. So each pair (i,j) and (j,i) contributes n_i n_j (σi σj) + n_j n_i (σj σi) = n_i n_j (σi σj + σj σi). Which is n_i n_j [σi, σj] + 2 δ_{ij} I ? Wait, no. Wait, for i≠j, σi and σj anticommute, so σi σj = -σj σi. So σi σj + σj σi = 0.

Ah, right! So when i≠j, the terms n_i n_j (σi σj + σj σi) = 0. So the entire sum of cross terms is zero. So (σ·n)^2 = sum_i n_i^2 I = (sum n_i^2) I = I. Because n is a unit vector, sum n_i^2 =1.

So (σ·n)^2 = I. That's helpful. So the eigenvalues of σ·n must satisfy (λ)^2 = 1, so λ = ±1.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). So H is ε multiplied by that matrix. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ·n. So H has eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, so looking at the options: option B is plus epsilon and minus epsilon. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have a matrix multiplied by a scalar, its eigenvalues scale by that scalar. Since σ·n has eigenvalues ±1, then H = ε (σ·n) has eigenvalues ±ε. So the correct answer is option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the properties of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a Hermitian matrix, and its eigenvalues are determined by the fact that \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This follows because \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, ensuring \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \), and the cross terms involving \( \sigma_i \sigma_j \) (for \( i \neq j \)) cancel out due to the anticommutation relations of the Pauli matrices. Thus, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

Since \( H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are not \( \pm 1 \).  
**B)** Correct, as the eigenvalues are \( \pm \varepsilon \).  
**C)** Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are not scaled by \( \hbar/2 \).  
**D)** Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are not \( \pm \hbar/2 \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Answer: B
