Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and the results when changing the fixation method. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question says that they did a ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After sequencing, they found some peaks, but when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. The options are about where these peaks are likely located.

Wait, I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It's commonly used to fix proteins to DNA in ChIP experiments. DSG? Oh right, DSG is another crosslinker, I think it's a sulfonating agent. It's often used for more efficient crosslinking, especially in cases where PFA might not crosslink well enough. Wait, maybe DSG is used in combination with PFA to make the crosslinking more effective, especially for proteins that are hard to fix.

So the original experiment used PFA alone, and when they added DSG, some peaks went away. I'm trying to think about how crosslinking affects ChIP results. The idea is that crosslinking stabilizes protein-DNA interactions, so the method used should help in pulling down the DNA-protein complexes.

If the peaks disappeared when adding DSG, that suggests that the initial PFA fixation might have missed some regions, meaning that under PFA alone, some regions weren't efficiently crosslinked. So when they added DSG, which possibly helps in crosslinking, those regions might have become successfully crosslinked, but in the initial case, they weren't captured.

Wait, but the question is about where those peaks were found in the first case but not in the second. Or wait, wait. The initial experiment (PFA) found peaks, but when they used PFA+DSG, those peaks disappeared. Hmm, perhaps the opposite. Or maybe not.

Wait, no, the initial condition was PFA-only, which gave peaks, and when they used PFA+DSG, the peaks went away. So maybe in the PFA-only case, certain regions are overrepresented, but with better crosslinking (DSG), those regions aren't there anymore.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if PFA+DSG is a better crosslinker, maybe it's better at
