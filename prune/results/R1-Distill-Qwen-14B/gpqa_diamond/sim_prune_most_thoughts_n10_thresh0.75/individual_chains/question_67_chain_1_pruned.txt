Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Since they're in p orbitals, each l is 1. So, l1 and l2 are both 1. The state they're in is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait, I thought when you couple angular momenta, the maximum possible l is l1 + l2. Oh right, 1 +1 is 2, so l can be 2, 1, or 0. But here, the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting eigenvalues of -침 each. So, we're looking for the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both give -침.

Wait, but L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. For a single particle in an p orbital, the possible eigenvalues are -l침, ..., +l침. So for each electron, l=1, their m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum, so we're only considering the orbital part.

But the state given is a coupled state, not a product state. So I need to think about how the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is written in terms of the product states of individual electrons.

The coupled states are built from the product of individual states. So the |1,1,2,-1> state can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states, where m1 and m2 are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. The coefficients come from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, I think.

Wait, when l1 = l2 =1 and L = 2, m = -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of m1 + m2 = -1. So all possible m
