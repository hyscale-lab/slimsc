Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, so σ is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism or something similar.

Wait, what's the mass dimension of κ? I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension is important for renormalizability. The idea is that terms in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension ≤4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) makes the action dimensionless.

So, to find the dimension of κ, I need to look at the other fields and terms in the Lagrangian. Let's break down L_int.

Each ψ field is a spinor, so its mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation tells us that the fields have to have dimension 3/2 to make the kinetic term (i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ) have dimension 4. So [ψ] = 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? It's made from [γ's], which are dimensionless. The gamma matrices are just matrices, so their commutator is dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is zero. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Wait, but when you contract μ and ν with F^{μν}, which is a field strength tensor. F is derived from the field A, which for electromagnetism has [A] =1. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu, so each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So F^{μν} is of dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term is ψ̄ σ F. The ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So each ψ is 3/2.

So the product is (3/2) + (0) + (2) multiplied by κ, right? Wait, no, let me see. ψ̄ is 3/2, σ_{μν} is 0, ψ is 3/2, and F^{μν} is 2.

So the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3. Then F is 2, so 3 + 2 =5. But wait, ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) =3. Then F adds 2, so 3+2=5? Wait, no, wait: the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, so the product is ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) times σ (dim 0) times ψ (3/2) times F (2). So adding up: 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the entire term has mass dimension 5.

But wait, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime. So each term in the Lag
