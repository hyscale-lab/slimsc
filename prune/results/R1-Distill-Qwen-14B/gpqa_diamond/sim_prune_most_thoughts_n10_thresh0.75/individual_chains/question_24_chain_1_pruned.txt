Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again and try to break it down.

The question involves two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids that don't decolorize bromine water anymore. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's part of mixture Y. Z is used as a solvent, and it doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.

So, what's being asked is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Hmm. Let's start by figuring out what Z is. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Let's calculate the molecular formula for Z.

Assuming Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28% which is 1/7. So, the fraction is 1/7.

The molar mass of Z would be (12n + m*1) g/mol. The mass of H is m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Let's solve for that.

Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So Z is CnH2n. That suggests it's an alkene or an alkyne, but wait, no, because when hydrogenated, Z doesn't react further. Hmm, wait. Wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps it's an alkane because alkenes and alkynes can be hydrogenated further. Oh wait, no. Wait, alkenes would become alkanes upon hydrogenation. But the problem says that when X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, only Z is formed, and Z doesn't react further. So Z must be an alkane because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions.

Wait, but wait. Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnH2n. Alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2. So, if it's CnH2n, that's an alkene or an alkyne. But wait, the question says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Alkenes would be hydrogenated to alkanes, so that can't be. So maybe Z isn't an alkene but something else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Let me calculate the exact mass. 14.28% is about 1/7, so let's calculate the molecular formula.

Each mole of Z has a molecular mass M = 12n + m. The mass of H is m, so (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So m=2n, so the formula is CnH2n. As I thought, that's an alkene, but that can't be because hydrogenation would add more H's. But according to the problem, Z is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y, but Z doesn't react further. So maybe Z is not an alkene but an alkyne that's hydrogenated to an alkane? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Z is a benzene derivative. But benzene (C6H6) has a mass fraction of H as (6)/(78) = 0.0769 or 7.69%, which is less than 14.28%. So that
