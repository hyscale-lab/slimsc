Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. The options are A to D, all around 1e-6 to 1e-7 M range.

Hmm. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we're dealing with different salts, maybe the solution is a buffer. Let me think about the salts involved.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation in water would be: KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-. But wait, in solution, phosphate can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3- depending on the pH. At 25°C, the phosphate species distribution is determined by the pKa values.

The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 =7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12. So the pKa1 is about 2.12 (since pKa = -log(7.5e-3)). pKa2 is around 7.21, because 6.2e-8 is about 1e-7.2, and pKa3 is about 11.74 (-log(1.8e-12)).

Wait, so in a solution that contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which species would be present? Well, if the pH is around the second pKa (7.21), then H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be the main species. But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

But wait, that's the third deprotonation. So if the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. But if the solution is at a pH around 7.21, then PO4^3- would only be a minor species. Because PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which has a very low Ka (Ka3=1.8e-12). So at pH 7.21, the concentration of PO4^3- would be low.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Molarity = moles / volume in liters.

So for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw 177.99. Moles = 1.00 /
