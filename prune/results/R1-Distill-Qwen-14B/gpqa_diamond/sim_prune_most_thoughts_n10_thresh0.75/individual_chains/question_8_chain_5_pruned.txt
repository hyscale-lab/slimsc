Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants. The resistance levels are measured as percentages of the control (wild-type) resistance, which is 100%.

The data:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (much more susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The question is about the interactions between these genes. The key points given are that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. We’re supposed to figure out the relationships, like which is a TF, epistasis, redundancy, pleiotropy, etc.

Let me think about what each term means:

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the phenotype of a mutation in Gene B depends on the genotype at Gene A.

Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits.

But in this context, the traits are the resistance levels, so perhaps the same gene affects the resistance in multiple ways.

Now, looking at the data:

First, the single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible.
- g2: 0% → so no resistance. This suggests that G2 is critical because without it, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for activating other defense genes. Because if G2 is a TF upstream, then knocking it out would disable the whole downstream pathway, making the plant very susceptible.

g3: 50% → less resistance but not as bad as g2. So G3 might be part of the same pathway but not the main regulator.

Looking at double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → Both mutations together result in 0% resistance. But wait, g2 alone is already 0%. So what does that mean? Well, if you have g2 and another mutation (g1), and the resistance is still 0%, that suggests that the function of G1 is either redundant with G2, or that G2 is upstream. Alternatively, G1 might not be in the same pathway as G2, but maybe its effect is only evident when G2 is present.

Wait, but in the case of g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when you have both g2 and g3 knocked out, it's still 0%. But g3's single mutant is 50%, so knocking out g3 doesn't change the fact that g2 knockout is already 0%. So when you have both, it's the same as g2. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2, but not necessary if G2 is already knocked out.

Similarly, g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes the resistance even lower. So maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps both contributing to resistance. But the double mutant is worse than either single, implying additive effects. If they were redundant, then the double would be the same as the single with the worse effect. But in this case, both g1 and g3 contribute, so their functions are additive.

But wait, when you combine g1 and g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so knocking both out makes things worse. Alternatively, they may be additive in their function.

But let's think about the epistasis. The question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream. So let's assume G2 is the transcription factor because g2 knockout is completely susceptible. So perhaps G2 is the upstream factor that activates other genes, like G1 and G3, which are downstream.

Wait, but G3's single mutant is 50% resistance. So if G2 is upstream of G3, then knocking G2 out would make G3 non-functional, right? So in that case, knocking G3 out
