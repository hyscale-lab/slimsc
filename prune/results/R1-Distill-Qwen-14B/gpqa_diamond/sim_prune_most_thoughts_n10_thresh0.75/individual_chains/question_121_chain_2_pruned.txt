Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting an epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group from the reagent is added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) attacks. Right, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack the less substituted epoxide carbon in a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it has two rings: a four-membered and a one-membered? Wait, no, bicyclo notation is bicyclo[m.n.p], where m is the largest bridge. So [4.1.0] would mean bridges of 4, 1, and 0 carbons. Wait, not sure. Let me think: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings. The main ring is a four-membered bridge, another bridge of one carbon, and another bridge of zero? I'm getting a bit confused, but maybe it's easier to draw it mentally.

Wait, the compound is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The oxygen is at position 7. So the bicyclo structure has the oxygen in the ring. The substituents are 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S. So there are methyl groups at 1, 3, and 4 positions. Hmm.

When this epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi, which is a methyl organocuprate. The methyl group will add to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Also, considering the configuration: in disubstituted epoxides, the attack on one carbon leads to inversion at that carbon.

Wait, but this epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure. So the epoxide is a three-membered ring (epoxide is O connected to two
