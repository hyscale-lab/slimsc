Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let's take it step by step. The question gives me a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, I should think about the molecular formula. C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees: probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or a ring (but more likely another ring because it's a substituted benzene). Wait, benzene is three degrees, so the remaining one would be another ring or a double bond. But since both compounds are aromatic, maybe each has a benzene ring.

Wait, but each compound is C10H14, which suggests each is a mono-substituted benzene with a substituent that adds up to C4H10? Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. For each substituent, say a substituent R, the molecular formula would be C6 + R. So, if the molecular formula is C10H14, then R must contribute C4H8. Because 10-6=4, so R is C4H8. But wait, the degree of unsaturation for R would be (2*4 +2 -8)/2 = (10-8)/2=1. So, R has one degree, which could be a double bond (like a substituent with a double bond) or a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound is a disubstituted benzene with substituents adding up to C4H8. Wait, but the options given are all tetramethylbenzenes, except for option C which has diethyl.

Wait, looking at the options, all except option C
