Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved, right? So it's all about relative motion and maybe some special relativity effects? Wait, but wait. The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when a certain time passes in the ejecta's frame. Oh, time dilation maybe?

Wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because in inertial frames, velocities are opposite. So I think we can model this using classical mechanics for distance, but waitâ€”wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, let's calculate that. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. That's a significant speed, so relativistic effects might be important. But I'm not sure if the question expects a relativistic approach.

Wait, the problem seems to be in an inertial frame scenario, so perhaps we can use the Lorentz transformation to find the time in the Galaxy's frame and then calculate the distance. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple relative velocity problem, but I'm
