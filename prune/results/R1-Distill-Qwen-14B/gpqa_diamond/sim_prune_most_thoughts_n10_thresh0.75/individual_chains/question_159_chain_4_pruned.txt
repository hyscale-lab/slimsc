Okay, so I have this question about quasars and the universe's parameters, and I need to figure out the comoving distance. Hmm, let's think.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Wait, but the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. But if the flux is dropping below 790 nm, that's in the near infrared. Wait, no, 790 nm is infrared? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, visible light is about 400-700 nm, so 790 would be near infrared. So the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below that. Hmm, maybe this is the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to redshift.

Wait, no, the Lyman-alpha line is 121 nm. If the quasar's emission is being redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer. So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's the rest wavelength being shifted. But wait, 790 is in the near IR, so the rest wavelength must be shorter. Oh wait, perhaps the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, so it must be a redshifted line.

Wait, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line. If the rest wavelength is 121 nm, and the observed is 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest = (790 - 121)/121 ≈ 669/121 ≈ 5.528. So z is about 5.5. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate that again. 790 divided by 121 gives me 6.528, so z would be 5.528. Hmm, that's a high redshift.

Alternatively, wait, the question might be about the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is 91.2 nm, which is the ionizing photon. But the peak is at 790 nm, so that's much longer. Maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line being observed at 790, so z is (790
