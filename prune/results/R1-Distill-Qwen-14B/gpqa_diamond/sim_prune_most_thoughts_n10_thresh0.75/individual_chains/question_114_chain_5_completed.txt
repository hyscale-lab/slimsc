Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is:
Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Hmm, butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone or (CH3)2CO. So, that's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN), I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition reactions. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo a condensation reaction. Wait, but wait, NaCN is the nucleophile. So sodium cyanide provides the CN- ion, which acts as a nucleophile.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it undergoes a substitution reaction, specifically a substitution of the carbonyl oxygen. So the product would be a cyanohydrin. The structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile makes sense. Let me draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would get a hydrogen from somewhere. Since the reaction is with NaCN, maybe under acidic conditions? Because sometimes, for these additions, an acid is used as a catalyst. Wait, but in this case, the reagent A is used along with NaCN. So perhaps A is providing the acidic environment.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The reaction between a ketone and NaCN typically requires an acid catalyst. For example, H3O+ is often used. So in the presence of H3O+, the CN- would attack the carbonyl, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So the product would be the addition of CN and OH groups on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So yes, that makes sense. So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+, and option B also has H3O+. So that could be a possible choice.

Now the second reaction is:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. So the transformation is nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, typically with H2O and a strong acid like HCl, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product, like an amide or a ketone, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so probably hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Wait, wait, but let me think about the reagent B. The reaction is in the presence of B and H2O. So B is the catalyst. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if B is something else like CH3COOH (acetic acid), that's also an acid, but a weaker one.

So for the second reaction, reagent B should be a strong acid, probably HCl. So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: B is HCl. That fits.
Option C: B is HCl as well, but A is NaHSO3, which doesn't fit the first reaction.
Option D: B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid. Would that work for hydrolysis to carboxylic acid? Maybe, but I think HCl is more commonly used for such reactions because it's a strong acid and provides the necessary H+ ions for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the first reaction again. If the reagent A is H3O+ (like in options A and B), that's a strong acid. What about the other options where A is NaHSO3? I think NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. Could it be used as a catalyst in the first reaction?

Wait, the first reaction is butanone plus NaCN. I'm pretty sure that for the formation of cyanohydrin, an acid catalyst is needed. But which acid? Could it be H3O+ or another acid like H2SO4?

Wait, sodium cyanide is a strong base, right? So perhaps in the presence of a strong acid, it can form the cyanide ion. Alternatively, if the reagent A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid), but I'm not sure if that's sufficient. I think H3O+ (option A or B) is more likely the correct reagent for A.

So putting it together:

First reaction (A) is H3O+ (so option A or B).

Second reaction (B) is HCl (so option A or C).

Looking at the options, option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When nitriles are hydrolyzed, under acidic conditions, they typically go through an intermediate imine stage, but for a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, would that affect the reaction?

Wait, the product is a 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the hydroxyl group remains. So the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid is the key step here.

In acidic conditions (like HCl and water), the nitrile group is hydrolyzed via a two-step addition of water. So yes, B should be HCl.

So the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That should be the answer. Let me double-check the options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. Correct.

But wait, option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So let me think again about the first part. Could NaHSO3 be used as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation?

Hmm. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is a mild reducing agent and a weaker acid. I'm not sure if it's a suitable catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. Typically, for such additions, a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4 is used. So maybe A can't be NaHSO3. So option C and D are out for the first part.

So option A is the correct choice.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion (CN⁻). Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction to proceed.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of H₂O. This transformation requires acidic conditions, and HCl is a strong acid commonly used for such hydrolysis reactions. A weaker acid like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is less effective for this purpose. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate reagent for the second reaction.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This fits both reactions: H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is suitable for the nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not a suitable catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation, as it is a weaker acid and not typically used for this reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
