Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The key clue is the NOESY NMR spectrum. The major has a cross-peak, minor doesn't. I need to find which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, I'll jot down the steps:

1. Dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene → dehydrated to anhydride.
2. Anhydride structure: The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, how does that happen? Maybe equivalent protons, like in a symmetrical structure. 13C has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Wait, that's probably an anhydride carbonyl and an alpha carbon. Or maybe the 137 is a carbonyl adjacent to something else.

Wait, anhydride carbonyls are usually around 170-185 ppm. So 165 is a bit lower. Could be an ester or amide carbonyl, but in this case, maybe it's part of the anhydride. Alternatively, maybe 137 is a carbonyl adjacent to another group. Not entirely sure yet.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride is a single peak at 7 ppm. High shift. Maybe it's a singlet, but what gives a peak around 7 ppm? Could be aromatic protons, but since it's an anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid, perhaps it's not aromatic. Wait, perhaps an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe the protons are near a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an olefinic proton. But wait, since the starting material is a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, possibly a five-membered ring, which would have an olefin as part of the anhydride structure.

Wait, when a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene is dehydrated, it would form an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, the dehydration would likely form a bicyclic structure or a cyclic anhydride. For example, the acid groups are on adjacent carbons with a cis double bond. Dehydration would lead to a ring formation. Maybe the anhydride is a bicyclic structure, like a five-membered ring with an ester or anhydride group.

But let's think about the NMR data. 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift. That makes me think of alkenyl protons or possibly an aromatic ring. But again, it's an anhydride, so maybe it's an exo-methylene group, which typically resonate around 5-6 ppm. Hmm, but 7 ppm is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to the carbonyl. Or perhaps it's vinyl protons in a conjugated system.

Wait, another thought. The 13C NMR has two peaks. One at 137 ppm, which is indicative of a sp² carbon. Maybe a carbonyl carbon adjacent to another structure. The 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon, perhaps the anhydride's carbonyl. Wait, but anhydride carbonyls are typically higher, like 170-185, so 165 is a bit low. Maybe it's an ester carbonyl? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another approach:
