Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and I need to find the momentum of the photon that will cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... I think this model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the molecule's energy isn't just due to rotation or vibration, but both. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and the next state. So I need to figure out the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So maybe the molecule is in the ground state of both rotation and vibration. But when it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next higher state. Now, what's the next state? The problem says the lowest possible energy in the next state. So perhaps that's the first excited state, which would be the next higher energy level. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the first rotational state or the first vibrational state. Or maybe a combination of both?

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of
