Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum state. Hmm, I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait. Wait a minute, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe I should check if it's normalized. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state's norm is sqrt(6), so it's not a unit vector. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. Hmm. Maybe the given state is a vector that's not normalized, but when we compute probabilities, we'll have to normalize it first. Or perhaps the problem expects us to proceed without normalizing because the probabilities might not require it? Not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

The operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P =
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Hmm, I should also check if P is Hermitian because observables are Hermitian. The matrix P, let's see: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's okay. The (2,3) element is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is same, so yes, P is Hermitian. So P is a valid observable.

The operator Q is also given:

Q =
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible results are 1, 0, -1. And the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, I think. Because Q|1> = 1|1>, Q|2> =0|2>, Q|3> = -1|3>.

So the question is: measure P first, then Q. What's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no. Wait, the measurements are done in sequence: first measure P, then measure Q. So the first measurement affects the state for the second measurement. So the process is:

1. Start with state |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1].
2. Measure P, obtaining outcome 0. This collapses the state to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
3. Then, measure Q on this new state, and we want the probability of Q being -1.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability that Q=-1 given the post-measurement state of P=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is the other way around. Wait, no, the question says measure Q after P. So the first measurement is P, then Q.

Wait, but I think the way to approach such problems is to first find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of both operators. Then, when measuring P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, we look at the eigenvalue of Q in that state.

But wait, another approach: Since P and Q may not commute, the order matters. But
