Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the supernova ejecta part is moving towards the center of the Galaxy, and both are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So wait, that means the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy, right? Because in different frames, velocities add inversely.

The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, no, the other way around. Because the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm, time dilation maybe?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's break it down. The two frames are the ejecta (let's call it frame E) and the Galaxy (frame G). In E, the center of G is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So in G, the ejecta is moving at the same speed towards the center, right? Because velocity is relative. So in G's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But the time given is in E's frame. So in E's frame, 50 seconds pass, and we want to find how much distance the ejecta covers in G's frame during this time. Wait, that doesn't sound right because from E's frame, G is moving towards it, so the time experienced in E is different from G's time. Oh wait, no, the question is about the distance in G's frame when 50 seconds (E's time) have passed. So I think we need to relate the two frames using time dilation.

So, the key here is to find the time in G's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in E's frame. Because the distance would be speed (in G's frame) multiplied by time in G's frame.

Wait, but I'm a bit mixed up. The distance the ejecta travels in G's frame is v multiplied by the time measured in G's frame, right? So first, I need to find how much time passes in G
