Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the scenario is a scientist is setting up a calibration curve for qPCR. He's using a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. An efficiency of 100% is ideal because it means the data should fit perfectly.

The R² value is 1, which means the data points perfectly fit the regression line. That's great because it indicates a good calibration curve. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I think the slope in a qPCR curve is related to the efficiency. The formula I recall is slope = ln(10)/log10(efficiency), but wait, actually, the standard formula I remember is that the slope should be about -3.32 if the efficiency is 100% because (ln(10)/ln(2)) is approximately 3.32. So a slope of -3.3 is very close to that, which makes sense for 100% efficiency.

Now, looking at the data points. For each concentration, he has three technical replicates. Let me list them out:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2
10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average about 30.9
1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → average 27.6
100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → average 24.3
10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → average 21

Wait, but what's the expected relationship between copy number and Ct? Lower copy numbers should result in higher Ct values because it takes more cycles to detect the target. So as copy number decreases, Ct increases. Wait, no, wait: higher initial copies mean more DNA, so it reaches the threshold sooner (lower Ct). So the data should go like, high concentration → low Ct, low concentration → high Ct. Let's check:

100,000 → Ct ~34.2
10,000 → ~30.9 (lower Ct, which makes sense because more copies)
1,000 → ~27.6 (even lower Ct)
100 → ~24.3
10 → ~21
Yes, that's correct. So the data trends correctly.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are about possible explanations.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. But wait, the efficiency is 100%, R
