Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, okay, so we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, which probably means it's a decomposition reaction in an inert atmosphere. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temp and pressure.

Let me break this down. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)₂, which is a drying agent, I think. Oh wait, no, I remember Mg(ClO4)₂ is used for absorbing water, like as a desiccant. So when gases pass through it, any water vapor would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. So the weight increase in tube 1 is due to water, H2O. So 3.60 grams of H2O were produced. 

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)₂ solution. If the gas doesn't react, the weight doesn't change. So the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)₂. That suggests that the gas isn't CO₂ or SO₂ or something acidic. Maybe it's an inert gas or something like N₂, O₂? Or perhaps another possibility.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. For example, H2 can react with Cu to form Cu and water, but I'm not sure. Wait, when gases pass through red-hot copper, maybe they are oxidized. For instance, CO might react to form CO₂, but that's not it. Alternatively, H2 could react in the presence of a catalyst, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: if the gas is H2S, but no, that would probably react with Cu(OH)₂ in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a reducing agent, and reacts with CuO. Oh wait, tube 3 is red-hot copper, so perhaps the gas is something like CO, which might reduce CuO, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO₂, but I don't think that would react with copper in that setup. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that CuO is formed in tube 3. So the reaction in tube 3 must involve the gas forming CuO. That suggests that the gas is a reducing agent, like H2 or CO. For example, if the gas is H2, it could reduce CuO to Cu, forming water. Or if it's CO, similar thing. Because CuO is formed, maybe the reaction is the reverse. Let me think: if copper is in a tube and reacts with a gas to form CuO, perhaps the gas is O₂? But O₂ wouldn't react in that way. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something reacting with the copper to form oxide. Alternatively
