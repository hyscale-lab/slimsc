Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

The problem says there's an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Wait, so that's like the probability in the first 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, no. Let me read that again. Oh, the next 150 minutes, but wait, does that mean the remaining time after the 50 minutes have passed? Or is it starting from now?

Wait, the setup is that we have the atom, and we started monitoring right away. So the total time we're considering is 50 minutes passed without decay, and now we're looking at the next 150, which would make it 200 minutes total from the start. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Wait, no. Because radioactive decay is memoryless. So the probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh, right! Because each atom has a constant probability per unit time, so the past doesn't affect the future. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the current probability.

Wait, but wait, let me clarify. The decay probability is given as
