Okay, so I've got this physics problem about relativistic speeds and energies. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Alright, let's break it down. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first astronaut is moving faster than the second.

Wait, the first part asks for the relative speed between them. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally. The formula for relative velocity is different. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait. Because velocities don't just subtract like that in relativity. Let me get the exact formula.

So, if one object is moving at velocity u and another at v, both in the same direction, the relative velocity of u with respect to v (or is it the other way around?) Wait, no. The relative speed of the first astronaut as seen from the frame of the second. Or vice versa? Maybe that's a point I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says "relative speed" between them. So, the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared).

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from B's frame, what is A's velocity? Or wait, no, the problem says the relative speed. So I think it's the speed of one relative to the other.

So using the formula: v_rel = (u - v) / [1 - (u v)/(c²)]

Here, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So substituting:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)]

Calculating numerator: 0.1c

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Oh wait, the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. So for each astronaut, their energy is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but their rest masses are 2m and 3m, so we need to adjust for that.

For the first astronaut: energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So for 0.6c:
