Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an interesting formula. Let me break that down. Carbon: 8, Hydrogen: 9, Nitrogen: 1, Oxygen: 1. Wait, so the degrees of unsaturation might give me an idea about the structure. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, N is 1, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: that's either five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. But more likely, maybe one ring and a couple double bonds?

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H).

Starting with the 9.72 ppm peak. That's a triplet, and integrating for 1H. A triplet at around 9-10 ppm makes me think of an aldehyde proton. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like an aromatic -OH, but those usually are broad and maybe around 5 ppm, but this is higher. Wait, but sometimes phenolic OH might be exchanged, but in the NMR given, I don't see another peak that could be an OH. Hmm, but wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's an enol? Or maybe a coupling between protons adjacent to an oxygen or something else.

Wait, the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, and as a triplet suggests that it's next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet in an aldehyde would mean coupling with two adjacent protons. So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde (RCHO), and the adjacent carbon is a CH2 group. So RCH2CHO? Or maybe the aldehyde is at the end, and the adjacent is CH2.

Wait, looking at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each for 2H. Those look like para-substituted aromatic protons. So perhaps two phenyl groups attached? Because if each is a pair of doublets, maybe theyâ€™re in para positions. So each of those could be a substituent on a benzene ring.

Then the 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe coupling with multiple protons or exchange, but in this case, perhaps it's a conjugated system. Maybe conjugated double bonds, like an enol or something with adjacent double bonds. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring
