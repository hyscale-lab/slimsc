Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive based on some observations. Hmm.

So, the problem says there are two binary systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. So the orbital period of the stars around each other is the same as the eclipse period, right? Because they eclipse each other as they orbit. So system_1's orbital period is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

Next, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the two stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. Oh wait, I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The RV amplitude is how much each star moves towards and away from us. The more massive star would have a smaller RV because it's moving less around the center of mass. So the more massive star has a smaller RV amplitude.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We need to find the mass ratio, I think. Or maybe the total mass of each system.

Wait, but how do I relate the RV amplitudes and the periods to the
