Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states. Oh yes, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and g_i and g_j are the degeneracies.

In this problem, since it's the same element (iron), I think the degeneracies for the two energy levels would be the same, so g_i/g_j is 1. So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same level.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is higher.

Let me think. Let’s denote the energy levels as E. So, for star_1, the number of atoms in a higher energy level (let's say E2) compared to the lower level (E1) is n_1. Similarly for star_2, it's n_2.

Wait, actually, the question says the same specific energy level. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the energy difference is given, so E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the excitation is in the same energy levels but the population differs.

But wait, the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, because it's the same transition. Oh, because both stars have iron atoms, so the energy levels are the same. So the energy difference E between the two levels is the same for both stars.

In star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So, let me model this.

For star_1: n1 = number in excited state, and n2 is the number in the lower state. But wait, no, in each star, the ratio of the excited to lower states would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, wait, the ratio is for each star. So in star_1, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star_2, the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), assuming same g factors.

But in the problem, it's stated that the excited state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Wait, no, wait. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2."

Wait, perhaps the ratio of excited to ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So, for each star, the ratio is (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, this ratio is R1, and for star_2, it's R2.

The problem says R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1's excited level is twice as excited as star_2's.

Wait, or maybe more accurately, n_upper
