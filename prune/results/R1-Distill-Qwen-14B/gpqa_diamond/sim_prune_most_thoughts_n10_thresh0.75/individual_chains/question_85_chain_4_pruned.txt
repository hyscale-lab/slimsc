Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's calculated based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. But wait, I think the exact formula might vary a bit depending on the source. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). So the ratio of the two planets' temperatures would be the square root of (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ), multiplied by sqrt((1 - A1)/(1 - A2)) but since both planets have the same albedo, the (1-A) terms cancel out. So the ratio becomes sqrt(a2/a1), because the R_star and 2 just cancel each other, so sqrt(a2)/(sqrt(a1)) = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, no, waitâ€”if a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star), and we're taking the square root of (R/(a)), no. Let me get the formula right.

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to the star's temperature multiplied by sqrt(R_star/(a)) / sqrt(2), and then multiplied by (1 - A)^1/4. But since both albedos are the same, that part cancels when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt(a2 / a1). Because T1 is proportional to sqrt(R/(a1)), T2 proportional to sqrt(R/(a2)), so T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(a1)) / (R/(a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it more carefully.

Equilibrium temperature equation for each planet:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since A is the same for both, when taking the ratio T1/T2, that term cancels out.
