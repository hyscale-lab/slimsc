      "full_content": "Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.\n\nSo, the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check the norm of this vector. The square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state is not normalized. I'll have to normalize it before using it in calculations. So the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThe operators P and Q are given as matrices. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I think this is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nAnd the operator Q is another 3x3 matrix with first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q looks like:\n\nQ = [\n[1, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, -1]\n]\n\nThe question is: After measuring P, then measuring Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?\n\nWait, no. The measurement order is P first, then Q. So the process is: measure P, get outcome 0; then measure Q, get outcome -1. What's the probability of that happening.\n\nI think the approach is to first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the state onto that eigenvector to find the probability of measuring 0 for P. Then, given that the system is in that eigenvector state, find the probability of measuring -1 for Q.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system collapses into the eigenvector of P upon measurement, so after measuring P and getting 0, the state becomes the eigenvector corresponding to 0. Then, using that state, we calculate the probability for Q being -1.\n\nLet me think in steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nThe operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute its eigenvalues.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix (P - \u03bbI) is:\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0      |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n| 0       1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      |\n\nI can expand this determinant. Let me write it out.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, expanding along the first row.\n\n= (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo let's compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ] \u2192 -(1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term is 0.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0\n\nExpanding:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0\n\nWait, let's compute each term again:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) ) ] \u2192 -(1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) )= \u03bb/(2)\n\nSo the determinant becomes:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) )=0.\n\nSo eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, no. Let me solve \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo P has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, but the way the determinant was calculated, we have -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb^2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb= \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but the matrix P seems to have a symmetric structure, so perhaps it's Hermitian? Because in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian.\n\nLooking at each element of P:\n\nP_12 = 1/sqrt(2), P_21=1/sqrt(2) \u2192 same, so P is symmetric in the upper triangle. Similarly, P_13=0, P_31=0, P_23=1/sqrt(2), P_32=1/sqrt(2). So yes, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. That's good because it's an observable.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvectors for P for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo solve (P - 0 I ) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0 1/\u221a2 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 =0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 +0 v3=0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0.\n\nFrom row 2: v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3= -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So a basis vector is (1, 0, -1). But wait, let's check the normalization.\n\nWait, for the eigenvector, any non-zero scalar multiple is allowed. So the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1). But we'll need to normalize it later.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u03c8> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). Because the original vector has a norm squared of 6.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n|\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ]\n\nNow, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are 0,1,-1.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the eigenvector we found is (1,0,-1). Let me write it as |0> = [1; 0; -1 ].\n\nWait, but I need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is |0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1 ].\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and |0>.\n\nSo amplitude a = <0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) ) ]\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/(sqrt(12))) (-2)\n\n= (-2)/ (2 * sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3)\n\nSo the amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3), and the probability is |a|^2 = (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector |0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q, and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nThe operator Q has eigenvalues as per its diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, Q is a diagonal matrix:\n\nQ = diag(1, 0, -1)\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo, for -1 eigenvalue, the eigenvector is |q=-1> = [0,0,1].\n\nNow, the state after collapse is |0> = [1; 0; -1 ] / sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to compute the probability that a measurement of Q yields -1. This is the square of the amplitude of |q=-1> in the state |0>.\n\nSo the amplitude is <q=-1 | 0> \u2192 [0,0,1] \u00b7 [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2) = ( -1 ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nThe probability is | -1/sqrt(2) |^2 = (1/2).\n\nSo the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial state is |0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nTo find the probability of Q=-1, which projects onto the third basis vector (0,0,1), we take the inner product.\n\nThe third component of |0> is (-1)/sqrt(2). So the amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(2), and the probability is (1/2).\n\nSo combining both steps, the probability of measuring P=0 then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, because the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step given the previous outcome.\n\nSo P=0 first with probability 1/3, then Q=-1 with probability 1/2 given that P was 0. So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any errors in the calculations.\n\nFirst, the eigenvalues of P: 0, 1, -1. For \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1], as found. Then, the inner product calculation for the initial state gives 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2,1 ] \u00b7 [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2) \u2192 ( (-1)(1) + 0 + (1)(-1) ) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (-2) / sqrt(12) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3). Squared magnitude is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen, after P=0, the state is [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). The Q operator's eigenstates are standard basis vectors. To find the probability of Q=-1, which is the third component.\n\nThe third component of |0> is (-1)/sqrt(2). So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability is 1/2.\n\nMultiply 1/3 * 1/2 =1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), represented by their respective matrices. The task is to calculate the probability of obtaining \\( P = 0 \\) followed by \\( Q = -1 \\) in sequential measurements.\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe given state vector is \\( (-1, 2, 1) \\). Its norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Norm}^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, solve \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). The characteristic equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda^3 + \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), solving \\( (P - 0I)v = 0 \\) gives the eigenvector:\n\n\\[\nv = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nNormalizing this eigenvector, we get:\n\n\\[\n|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) is the square of the inner product between \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) and \\( |0\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle 0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nComputing the dot product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle 0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{6}} \\left[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \\right] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(P = 0) = |\\langle 0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: State after measuring \\( P = 0 \\)\nUpon measuring \\( P = 0 \\), the system collapses into the eigenstate \\( |0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Probability of measuring \\( Q = -1 \\)\nThe operator \\( Q \\) is diagonal:\n\n\\[\nQ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue \\( Q = -1 \\) corresponds to the eigenvector \\( |q = -1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). The probability of measuring \\( Q = -1 \\) is the square of the inner product between \\( |q = -1\\rangle \\) and \\( |0\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle q = -1 | 0 \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(Q = -1) = |\\langle q = -1 | 0 \\rangle|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Combined probability\nThe total probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) followed by \\( Q = -1 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \\cdot P(Q = -1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D) \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)**",
