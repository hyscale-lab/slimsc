      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe metric given is ds\u00b2 = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a type of surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like, in hyperbolic geometry. The metric here seems to be in two dimensions, considering the dx and dy terms.\n\nWait, I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere often resembles something like ds\u00b2 = dr\u00b2 + (a\u00b2 sinh\u00b2(r/a))\u00b2 d\u03b8\u00b2 or something similar, but this doesn't look like that. Maybe it's written in isothermal coordinates or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conformally flat metric because I see the (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2) multiplied by a function. Conformal metrics usually have the form ds\u00b2 = f(x,y) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2), so this fits.\n\nThe question is about finding the area. The area in a metric is given by the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So the determinant of the metric tensor would be the product of the coefficients of dx\u00b2 and dy\u00b2 minus the cross terms squared. But in this case, the metric is diagonal and the cross terms are zero, so det g = [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)]^2. Wait, no: the metric tensor components g_xx = 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), g_yy = same, and g_xy = 0. So determinant is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2))^2 * (1)(1) - 0 = [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)]\u00b2. So the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt([32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)]\u00b2) = 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Therefore, the area element is (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy.\n\nWait, but the metric is given as ds\u00b2 = [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). So that's a 2D metric. So when calculating the area, you integrate the area element over the whole surface.\n\nBut the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmmm. Wait, what's the radius here? The radius in a pseudosphere is a bit tricky because it's a constant curvature, but in hyperbolic terms. The radius r is related to the curvature. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative, K = -1/(r^2). So if the radius is 2, then K would be -1/4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can find the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. I think the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula for a conformal metric: K = - (1/(2 f)) * \u0394(ln f), where \u0394 is the Laplacian in flat space. Let me see. Hmm, f here is 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). So ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Taking the Laplacian of ln f:\n\nThe Laplacian is the sum of second derivatives with respect to x and y. So the second derivative of ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) with respect to x is (2)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Similarly for y. So the Laplacian is (2 + 2)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)\u00b2) * (-1) because the derivative of ln(a - r\u00b2) is 2(-x)/(a - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), then the second derivative would involve negative signs.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it step by step. Let me compute the first derivative: d/dx [ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] = (-2x)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Then the second derivative is [ (-2)(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) ) - (-2x)(-2x) ] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2. So that's [ -2(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) -4x\u00b2 ] / denominator squared. Simplify numerator: -8 + 2x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2 -4x\u00b2 = -8 - 2x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should factor that. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for a function f(r) where r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, the Laplacian in 2D is (1/r)(d/dr)(r df/dr). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, alternative approach. Let me compute the Laplacian of ln(4 - r\u00b2), where r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Then,\n\nThe first derivative (gradient) is (2r dr) / (4 - r\u00b2), so the divergence would be (1/r) d/dr [ (4 - r\u00b2) * (2r) / (4 - r\u00b2) ) ].\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, let me compute the Laplacian more directly.\n\nCompute the Laplacian of ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2):\n\nIn 2D, the Laplacian is \u2207\u00b2 f = (\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2) + (\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2).\n\nCompute \u2202f/\u2202x = (-2x)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2).\n\nThen \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 = [ (-2)(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) + (2x)(2x) ) ] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator: -2(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) +4x\u00b2 = (-8 + 2x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2) +4x\u00b2 = (-8) +6x\u00b2 +2y\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = [ (-2y)(4 - x\u00b2 - y^2) ) ]', but wait, let me compute it:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202y = (-2y)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2).\n\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = [ (-2)(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) + (-2y)(-2y) ) ] / (4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo numerator: -2(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) +4y\u00b2 = (-8 +2x\u00b2 +2y\u00b2) +4y\u00b2 = (-8 +2x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2).\n\nNow sum the two second derivatives:\n\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = [ (-8 +6x\u00b2 +2y\u00b2) + (-8 +2x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2) ) ] / (denominator squared).\n\nAdding together: (-16) +8x\u00b2 +8y\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator is (-16 +8x\u00b2 +8y\u00b2) = 8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2).\n\nSo Laplacian of ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) is [8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat is K = - (1/(2f)) * Laplacian(ln f). Let me confirm that formula.\n\nYes, for a metric ds\u00b2 = f(dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2f)) * \u2207\u00b2 (ln f). So here, f=32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2).\n\nSo, ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - x\u00b2 - y^2). Laplacian of ln f is the same as the Laplacian of (-ln(4 - r\u00b2)), since ln(32) is a constant and its Laplacian is zero.\n\nSo \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = \u2207\u00b2 (ln(32)) - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r\u00b2)).\n\nBut \u2207\u00b2 ln(32) is zero, so \u2207\u00b2(ln f) = - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r\u00b2)).\n\nWait, no, because ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r\u00b2). So \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = \u2207\u00b2 (ln(32)) - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r\u00b2)).\n\nBut since ln(32) is a constant, its Laplacian is zero. Hence, \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r\u00b2)).\n\nAnd from earlier, \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r\u00b2)) = [8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2. So \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = - [8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo then, K = - (1/(2f)) * [ -8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2) / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2 ].\n\nSimplify: K = (1/(2f)) * 8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2) / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut f = 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y^2), so substituting:\n\nK = [1/(2 * 32/(4 - r^2)))] * [8(r^2 - 2)]/(4 - r^2)^2.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me express this step by step.\n\nK = [1/(2f)] * [8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2.\n\nSubstituting f:\n\n1/(2f) = (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)/(64).\n\nSo,\n\nK = (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)/(64) * [8(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)^2\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) cancels with one in denominator, so:\n\n= [8 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2)] / (64 (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) )\n\nSimplify 8/64 = 1/8.\n\n= (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2) / [8 (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) ]\n\nHmm, but wait, that gives K as a function of x and y. But a pseudosphere should have constant curvature. So did I make a mistake? Because the given metric must be for a surface of constant curvature.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a computational error. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere. Let's recompute the Laplacian.\n\nWait, earlier, I computed \u2207\u00b2 (ln (4 - r\u00b2)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check:\n\nLet me compute \u2207\u00b2 ln (4 - r\u00b2) where r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nIn polar coordinates, r is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), but for Laplacian, in 2D, it's better to work in polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. Alternatively, compute using Cartesian coordinates.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian of ln(4 - r\u00b2) is:\n\n\u2202\u00b2 ln(4 - r\u00b2)/\u2202x\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2 ln(4 - r\u00b2)/\u2202y\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute \u2202/\u2202x ln(4 - r\u00b2) = (-2x)/(4 - r\u00b2).\n\nThen \u2202\u00b2/\u2202x\u00b2 = [ (-2)(4 - r\u00b2) ) + (4x\u00b2) ) ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, because:\n\nd/dx [ (-2x)/(4 - r\u00b2) ] = [ (-2)(4 - r\u00b2) ) + (-2x)(d/dx (4 - r\u00b2)) ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, (4 - r\u00b2) is 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nSo derivative of (4 - r\u00b2) w.r. to x is -2x.\n\nSo,\n\n\u2202\u00b2 ln(f)/\u2202x\u00b2 = [ (-2)(4 - r\u00b2) ) + (-2x)(-2x) ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nWhich is [ -2(4 - r\u00b2) +4x\u00b2 ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nSimilarly, \u2202\u00b2 ln(f)/\u2202y\u00b2 = [ -2(4 - r\u00b2) +4y\u00b2 ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nAdding both terms:\n\n[ -8 + 2r\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 ] + [ -8 + 2r\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 ] all over (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nWait, wait, 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 is 4r\u00b2, so adding gives:\n\n-8 +2r\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 -8 +2r\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 = (-16) +4r\u00b2 +2r\u00b2 +4r\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 =4r^2. So each term has 4x\u00b2 and 4y\u00b2 respectively.\n\nWait, no. Each term after adding:\n\nEach \u2202\u00b2 ln(f)/\u2202x\u00b2 term is [-2(4 - r\u00b2) +4x\u00b2 ]/(4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo when I add the \u2202\u00b2/\u2202x\u00b2 and \u2202\u00b2/\u2202y\u00b2, I get:\n\n[-2(4 - r\u00b2) +4x\u00b2 ]/(4 - r\u00b2)^2 + [-2(4 - r\u00b2)+4y\u00b2 ]/(4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nWhich is [ -4(4 - r\u00b2) +4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is r\u00b2, so:\n\n[ -4(4 - r\u00b2) +4 r\u00b2 ] / (4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nExpand numerator:\n\n-16 +4 r\u00b2 +4 r\u00b2 = -16 +8 r\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator is 8r\u00b2 -16 = 8(r\u00b2 - 2).\n\nSo \u2207\u00b2 ln(4 - r\u00b2) = [8(r\u00b2 - 2)]/(4 - r\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo going back to K:\n\nK = - (1/(2f)) * \u2207\u00b2 (ln f).\n\nBut ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r\u00b2).\n\nSo \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = \u2207\u00b2 (ln(32)) - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r^2)).\n\n\u2207\u00b2 (ln 32)=0, so \u2207\u00b2 (ln f) = - \u2207\u00b2 (ln(4 - r^2)).\n\nWhich is - [8(r\u00b2 - 2)/(4 - r^2)^2].\n\nSo, substituting into K:\n\nK = - (1/(2f)) * [ -8(r\u00b2 - 2)/(4 - r\u00b2)^2 ].\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nK = (1/(2f)) * 8(r\u00b2 - 2)/(4 - r^2)^2.\n\nNow, f = 32/(4 - r^2), so 1/(2f) = (4 - r^2)/(64).\n\nSo,\n\nK = [(4 - r^2)/(64)] * [8(r\u00b2 - 2)] / (4 - r^2)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe (4 - r^2) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving [8 (r\u00b2 -2)] / [64 (4 - r^2) ].\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recompute.\n\nWait,\n\n(4 - r^2) / 64 * 8(r^2 -2) / (4 - r^2)^2.\n\nSo:\n\n= [ (4 - r^2) * 8 (r^2 - 2) ) ] / [64 (4 - r^2)^2 ]\n\n= 8 (r^2 -2) / [64 (4 - r^2) ]\n\nSimplify 8/64 = 1/8.\n\nSo,\n\nK = (r^2 -2) / [8 (4 - r^2) ] * (1/8)\n\nWait, no, 8/(64) is 1/8.\n\nSo,\n\nK = [ (r\u00b2 - 2) ] / [8 (4 - r\u00b2) ]\n\nHmm, but this expression depends on r\u00b2, which suggests that the curvature is not constant. That can't be right because the metric is supposed to represent a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for K.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall the correct formula for the Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric. The formula is:\n\nK = - (1/(2f)) [ \u2202\u00b2 ln f / \u2202x\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2 ln f / \u2202y\u00b2 ]\n\nBut I think I might have messed up the sign somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the metric given.\n\nThe metric is ds\u00b2 = [32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y^2)] (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2).\n\nMaybe I can compare it to the metric of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Gaussian curvature by recognizing the metric.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the metric is for a sphere or a hyperboloid. Wait, another approach: calculate the Ricci scalar or the Gaussian curvature.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can consider the metric in terms of an isometric embedding.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the area and see which option makes sense.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) 0\n\nB) 4\u03c0(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nC)4\u03c0(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)\n\nD) +infty\n\nWait, but the area of a pseudosphere is infinite. Because a pseudosphere is like a hyperboloid of infinite extent in one direction. For example, a hyperbolic plane has infinite area, and a pseudosphere would be a surface of revolution of a hyperbola, which would have finite area? Or is it infinite?\n\nWait, wait, no. The standard pseudosphere is a finite surface. Wait, no. Wait, the standard pseudosphere is obtained by rotating a tractrix, which is a curve that has a finite length but when rotated gives a surface of finite area. Or is it infinite?\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. A sphere has finite area, but a pseudosphere's area is infinite. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the area is infinite because the radius is 2, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area can be infinite. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric's domain of definition is limited, which could affect the area.\n\nWait, the metric is defined in regions where (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) is positive, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would be problematic (since ds\u00b2 would be negative or undefined). So 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 >0 implies x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.\n\nWait, then the area would be the integral of the area element over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4. Wait, but the area element is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y^2)) dx dy.\n\nSo the area A is the integral over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4 of [32/(4 - (x\u00b2 + y^2))] dx dy.\n\nHmm, this seems like a standard integral in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates, where x\u00b2 + y^2 = r^2. So,\n\nA = \u222b (from r=0 to r=2) \u222b (\u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8.\n\nThe integrand becomes [32 r ]/(4 - r\u00b2).\n\nThe integral over \u03b8 is 2\u03c0. So A = 2\u03c0 * \u222b (0 to 2) [32 r ]/(4 - r\u00b2) dr.\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nLet me make a substitution. Let u =4 - r\u00b2. Then, du/dr = -2r \u2192 -du/2 = r dr.\n\nNow, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2) )\n\nSo, factor out the constants: 32 * (-1/2) = -16.\n\nBut because the limits are from 4 to 0, when we swap them, the negative sign goes away.\n\nSo,\n\nIntegral = 16 \u222b (u=0 to u=4) [1/u ] du.\n\nWhich is 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4.\n\nBut ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Because the domain x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4 is a finite disk, but the area element blows up at r=2. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.\n\nSo, the area of the pseudosphere (as per this metric) would be infinite, which corresponds to option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) +infty.\n\n\nThe given metric is:\n\n\\[\nds^2 = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \\left(dx^2 + dy^2\\right).\n\\]\n\nThis is a conformal metric in two dimensions, where the area element is given by:\n\n\\[\ndA = \\sqrt{\\det g} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \\, dx \\, dy.\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \\( r = 2 \\). To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The metric is valid for \\( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \\), which corresponds to the disk \\( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \\) in the \\( xy \\)-plane. Thus, the total area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \\, dx \\, dy.\n\\]\n\nSwitching to polar coordinates (\\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\)) and \\( \\theta \\) as the angular coordinate, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta.\n\\]\n\nThe angular integral contributes a factor of \\( 2\\pi \\), so:\n\n\\[\nA = 2\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \\, dr.\n\\]\n\nTo evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \\( u = 4 - r^2 \\), \\( du = -2r \\, dr \\), or \\( -\\frac{du}{2} = r \\, dr \\). When \\( r = 0 \\), \\( u = 4 \\), and when \\( r = 2 \\), \\( u = 0 \\). Substituting, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = 2\\pi \\cdot 32 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nA = 32\\pi \\int_0^4 \\frac{1}{u} \\, du.\n\\]\n\nThe integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u} \\, du \\) diverges as \\( u \\to 0 \\), because \\( \\ln u \\to -\\infty \\). Therefore, the total area is infinite.\n\nThis result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which has infinite area due to its hyperbolic geometry. The domain of the metric is finite (\\( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \\)), but the area element blows up at the boundary \\( r = 2 \\), leading to an infinite total area.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area of a pseudosphere is not zero.\n- **B) \\( 4\\pi(x^2 + y^2) \\)**: Incorrect. This is not a constant and does not represent the total area.\n- **C) \\( 4\\pi(x^2 - y^2) \\)**: Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area.\n- **D) \\( +\\infty \\)**: Correct. The area of the pseudosphere is infinite due to the divergence of the area integral at the boundary.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
