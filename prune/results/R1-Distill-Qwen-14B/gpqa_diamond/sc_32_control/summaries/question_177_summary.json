      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.\n\nThe question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Additionally, their radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume they radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity difference.\n\nWait, the question is asking by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. So, I need to find L1 / L2.\n\nI remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L is proportional to R\u00b2 T\u2074.\n\nOh, but wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898\u00d710^-3 m\u00b7K). So if \u03bb_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because T = b / \u03bb_max. So T1 = T2.\n\nWait, no, is that right? If \u03bb_max is the same, then T = same for both. Because \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T. So if the peaks are the same, T1 = T2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so maybe it's not moving relative to us, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So, the observed wavelength would be different if the star is moving towards or away from us. But the question says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. Hmm, so perhaps the observed \u03bb_max is same, but the intrinsic \u03bb_max (temperature) could be different. \n\nWait, that complicates things. Because the actual temperature of each star could be different, but when observed, their \u03bb_max as measured is same because of the Doppler shift. \n\nSo, because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest \u00d7 sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light. But wait, the formula I remember is \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but that's a linear approximation and only valid when v<<c. But if the velocities are significant (like 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light), maybe the approximation isn't so good. Alternatively, using the relativistic Doppler shift formula: \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, someone corrects for radial velocity when measuring temperature, so perhaps the actual temperature is adjusted by the Doppler effect. \n\nThis might be a point of confusion. Let's see: the peak wavelength (\u03bb_max) is observed. So, the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both stars. But the actual \u03bb_max (and hence T) of each star is different because of their velocities.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. Let's denote:\n\n\u03bb_observed for Star_1 = \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_rest (since v_r is 0, so no Doppler shift)\n\u03bb_observed for Star_2 = \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest \u00d7 (1 + v_r2 / c) approximately, assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away). Since Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs.\n\nBut for Star_1, \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_rest (since v_r is zero). For Star_2, \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest \u00d7 (1 + v_r2/c) if moving away. Alternatively, if moving towards us, it would be (1 - v_r2/c), but since the velocity is positive 700, maybe it's moving away. So, let me compute that.\n\nWait, wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest \u00d7 (1 + v/c). For speeds much less than c, this is a good approximation. So, if Star_2 is moving away at v = 700 km/s, then \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_rest * (1 + v/c).\n\nBut since \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs, and \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_rest (since v_r1=0), then:\n\n\u03bb1_rest = \u03bb2_rest * (1 + v2/c).\n\nBut from Wien's law, \u03bb_rest = b / T. So,\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).\n\nDividing both sides by b, we get 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).\n\nSo, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).\n\nWait, that could be a key point. So the intrinsic temperatures are different.\n\nLet me compute v2 in terms of c.\n\nv2 is 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s. So v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... approximately 0.233%.\n\nSo 1 + v2/c \u2248 1.002333.\n\nSo T1 \u2248 T2 / 1.002333 \u2248 T2 * (1 - 0.002333 + ... ), using the approximation 1/(1+x) \u2248 1 -x for small x.\n\nSo T1 \u2248 T2 * (0.9976667).\n\nSo the temperatures are almost the same, but slightly different.\n\nBut wait, since the problem is about the ratio of luminosities, perhaps the Doppler effect introduces a small correction. But the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, which suggests that the ratio is about 2.25 or higher.\n\nWait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first write down the formula for luminosity.\n\nL1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).\n\nWe know R1 = 1.5 R2.\n\nSo R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.\n\nSo the (R factors) contribute a factor of 2.25. But the T factors have to be considered as well.\n\nFrom earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c) \u2192 (T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v2/c) \u2248 1/(1.002333) \u2248 0.997666.\n\nThen (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997666)^4 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.997666 is approximately 1 - 0.002334.\n\nSo (1 - 0.002334)^4.\n\nUsing binomial approximation: (1 - x)^n \u2248 1 - n x.\n\nn=4, x=0.002334.\n\nSo (1 - 4*0.002334) = 1 - 0.009336 \u2248 0.990664.\n\nWait, but actually, maybe a better way is to compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 0.997666^4:\n\n0.997666^2 = (approx) 0.997666 * 0.997666.\n\nCompute 0.997666 * 0.997666:\n\n= (1 - 0.002334) * (1 - 0.002334) = 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2.\n\n= 1 - 0.004668 + (0.000005448).\n\n\u2248 0.995336448.\n\nThen square that to get to the 4th power:\n\n(0.995336448)^2 \u2248 ?\n\nAgain, expand:\n\n= (1 - 0.004663552)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.004663552 + (0.004663552)^2.\n\n= 1 - 0.009327104 + 0.00002175.\n\n\u2248 0.990698646.\n\nSo (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9907.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nL1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.227.\n\nWait, wait. So 2.25 multiplied by approximately 0.9907 is roughly 2.227. So around 2.23.\n\nLooking at the options, D is ~2.23.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Did I miscalculate the T ratio?\n\nWait, because in the Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is the same. So, let me re-examine the relation between the temperatures.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the relation between T1 and T2. Let me think again.\n\nThe observed peak wavelength \u03bb_obs is the same for both stars. For Star_1, since it's not moving, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_rest1 = b / T1.\n\nFor Star_2, which is moving away at velocity v_r2 = 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs2 = (\u03bb_rest2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ), but if v_r2 is much less than c, the approximation \u03bb_obs2 \u2248 \u03bb_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) holds.\n\nWait, or is it the other way around? The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c), correct?\n\nSo, for Star_2, \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).\n\nBut since \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2, and \u03bb_rest1 = b / T1, \u03bb_rest2 = b / T2,\n\nSo:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/T1 = (1 + v2/c)/T2 \u2192 T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).\n\nWhich is what I had before. So, T1 = T2 / (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = T2 / (1 + 0.002333) \u2248 T2 * (1 - 0.002333) \u2192 approximately 0.997667 T2.\n\nSo, (T1/T2) is 0.997667, so to the fourth power is approximately 0.9907.\n\nSo L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \u2192 (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.227.\n\nWhich is approximately 2.23, so option D.\n\nWait, but the options include A) ~2.25, which is the R^2 factor alone, but they probably included the Doppler effect which reduces it slightly. So the correct answer is D, ~2.23.\n\nBut wait, what if the Doppler effect was applied in a different way? Like considering the actual temperature shift due to velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the observed temperature is different. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so it appears hotter, and if moving away, it's redshifted, appearing cooler.\n\nSo in the case of Star_2 moving away, its observed temperature would be lower than its actual temperature. But wait, no, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, another approach: the observed wavelengths are the same, so their observed temperatures are the same. Because T = b/\u03bb_obs.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Star_2 is moving away, but they observed the same \u03bb_max. So that would imply that their observed temperatures are the same. So T_obs1 = T_obs2.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier approach. Let me think again.\n\nIf both stars have the same observed \u03bb_max, then their observed temperatures are the same. Because T = b/\u03bb_obs. So T_obs1 = T_obs2.\n\nSo for Star_1, which has v_r1 = 0, T_obs1 = T1.\n\nFor Star_2, which has v_r2 = 700 km/s, but is moving away, its observed temperature would be lower than its actual temperature. But since T_obs2 = T_obs1, perhaps T_obs2 is lower than T2.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let's clarify.\n\nThe observed temperature is T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) for relativistic Doppler shift when the source is moving away. Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for temperature shift.\n\nAlternatively, the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the rest wavelength \u03bb_rest of the star. So, for Star_1, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_rest1 = b / T1.\n\nFor Star_2, \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), because it's moving away. We know \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb_rest1 = \u03bb_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nBut \u03bb_rest1 = b / T1 and \u03bb_rest2 = b / T2.\n\nSo,\n\n(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nWhich is T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )\n\nAlternatively, T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )\n\nHmm, now this is different from before. Because earlier I used the linear approximation, but perhaps I should use the exact formula.\n\nSo with v =700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, but wait, no, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? Wait, 700 km = 7e5 meters. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v/c = (7e5) / (3e8) ) = 7 / 300 \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo, (1 - v/c) \u2248 0.997667, (1 + v/c) \u2248 1.002333.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) \u2248 (0.997667)/(1.002333) \u2248 0.995336.\n\nThe square root of that is sqrt(0.995336) \u2248 0.997666.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 / T2 \u2248 0.997666.\n\nSo, (T1 / T2)^4 \u2248 (0.997666)^4 \u2248 as computed earlier approximately 0.9907.\n\nSo then L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.227.\n\nWhich is about 2.23, so option D.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual temperatures are different, how does that affect the calculation of luminosity?\n\nWe're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So their intrinsic luminosity depends on their actual temperature and radius.\n\nSo, L = 4\u03c0 R^2 \u03c3 T^4.\n\nSo, when the problem says that the calculated luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor, they are comparing their actual luminosities, not the observed ones. Because the observed flux would be affected by distance, but the problem doesn't mention distance. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature but the actual temperature is what matters for luminosity.\n\nWait, but no, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies. So they must have used the actual temperatures of the stars, not the observed.\n\nWait, but how do they determine the actual temperature of the stars? Because if a star is moving, the observed spectrum is Doppler shifted. So, to get the actual temperature, the astronomer would correct for the Doppler shift.\n\nSo, for Star_1, since it's not moving, its observed spectrum is the same as its rest frame, so T1 is determined directly as T_obs1.\n\nFor Star_2, its spectrum is redshifted, so the astronomer would measure a lower observed temperature, but knowing that it's moving away, they would correct for the Doppler effect to find the actual T2.\n\nBut in this problem, it says that the peaks are at the same wavelength. So, the observed \u03bb_max is same for both. But when calculating luminosity, they would use the actual T (corrected for Doppler shift) and R.\n\nSo, using the actual T1 and T2, which are different because of their velocities.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation leads to L1/L2 ~2.23.\n\nBut let me re-derive this to make sure.\n\nGiven:\n\nL1 = 4\u03c0 R1\u00b2 \u03c3 T1^4,\n\nL2 = 4\u03c0 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T2^4.\n\nSo L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1^4) / (R2\u00b2 T2^4) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\n\nR1 = 1.5 R2 \u2192 (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.\n\nT1 and T2: earlier, from the Doppler shift.\n\nWait, but if the observed \u03bb_max is the same, then the observed temperatures are the same. So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.\n\nBut T_obs is related to the actual T by the Doppler shift. So, T_obs = T * (1 + v_r / c) for non-relativistic speeds when moving away. Wait, no, actually, the Doppler shift for temperature would be reciprocal. Because if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), which implies the observed temperature is lower.\n\nWait, the Doppler effect for temperature can be approximated as T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) for a star moving away.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).\n\nBecause temperature is inversely related to wavelength. So, if the star's light is redshifted (longer wavelength), the observed temperature would be lower than the rest frame temperature.\n\nSo, since Star_1's observed temperature is T_obs1 = T1.\n\nStar_2's observed temperature is T_obs2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).\n\nBut the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so the observed temperatures are the same (T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T_obs,\n\nT2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = T_obs.\n\nSo,\n\nT2 = T_obs / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = T_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T_obs,\n\nT2 = T_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1 / T2)^4 = ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )^2.\n\nSo, numerically, (v/c)=0.002333.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) \u2248 (0.997667)/(1.002333) \u2248 0.995336.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1/T2)^4 = (0.995336)^2 \u2248 0.9907.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.227.\n\nWhich is approximately 2.23, so the correct option is D.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) ~2.25\n\nB) ~2.32\n\nC) ~2.35\n\nD) ~2.23\n\nSo, the answer is D) ~2.23.\n\nBut wait, wait another moment. Because the actual calculation might require using the exact Doppler shift formula, not the approximation.\n\nLet me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) without approximation.\n\nv =700 km/s =7e5 m/s.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.00233333...\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667,\n\n(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.\n\nDividing these:\n\n0.997666667 / 1.002333333 \u2248 Let's compute it exactly.\n\n0.997666667 \u00f7 1.002333333.\n\nLet me compute this division.\n\n1.002333333 \u00d7 0.995336 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator approach.\n\nCompute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.\n\nWell, 1.002333333 is approximately 1.002333.\n\nSo,\n\nApproximately, 0.9976667 / 1.002333 \u2248 0.995336.\n\nTaking square root: sqrt(0.995336) \u2248 0.997666.\n\nSo, (T1/T2) is 0.997666, (T1/T2)^4 is approximately 0.9907.\n\nSo, 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.227, which is about 2.23.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:\n\n\\[\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n\\]\n\nThe luminosity ratio is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Radius Contribution\nThe radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \\implies \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Temperature Contribution\nThe problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.
