      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is about a meson resonance, X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a specific value in meters.\n\nHmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. Oh right, decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula I think is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, but how do I get tau? Oh, I think tau is related to the particle's width. The width \u0393 is related to the particle's lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / tau, so tau = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, units might be an issue here. I need to make sure all the units are consistent.\n\nLet me jot down the knowns:\n\n- E_X = 8 GeV\n- m_X = 1.2 GeV\n- \u0393_X = 320 MeV\n\nWait, the units for E and m are in GeV, and \u0393 is in MeV. I should convert them all to the same unit, probably to GeV or MeV. Maybe GeV is easier since E and m are in that.\n\nSo \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the formula for the mean decay distance. Let me think again. The mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / \u0393. Then, the decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBut first, I need to find gamma and beta. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c\u00b2) but wait, since E is given as the total energy, yeah. Hmm, actually, E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). But wait, E and m are in units that include c\u00b2, so perhaps the calculation can be done in natural units where c=1, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nWait, no, when you have E and m in energy terms, the formula for gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). But I think in particle physics, people often use units where c=1, so E in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2, but when c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2, so E = m, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the lifetime first, then find gamma and beta, then compute L.\n\nSo, let's compute tau first. Tau = \u0127 / \u0393. Let me remember the value of \u0127. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But I need to convert this into appropriate units because \u0393 is given in GeV.\n\nWait, I think it's easier to use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1, but then the conversion factors when going back to meters would be needed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta). \n\nWait, maybe another approach. The mean lifetime tau is related to the particle's width by the equation tau = \u0127 / \u0393. So, substituting the numbers, but I need to be careful about units.\n\nLet me get all units consistent. Let's convert everything into SI units.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV. Wait, no, the width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nBut GeV is a unit of energy. So, to get tau in seconds, I need to compute \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nI recall that \u0127 \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut 1 J = 1 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2. So, to convert \u0127 into units of GeV\u00b7s, I need to express \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\nSo, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s would be:\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) )^(-1) \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.\n\nSo, \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is:\n\n\u0127 (GeV\u00b7s) = \u0127 (J\u00b7s) / (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) )\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of unit conversion.\n\n\u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nWe can express \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s by using the conversion factor between J and GeV.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1 / 1.602e-10 GeV = approx 6.2415e9 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * (6.2415e9 GeV) ) * s \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV = approximately 6.2415e9 GeV.\n\nSo, 1 J\u00b7s = 6.2415e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nThus, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.2415e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nCalculating that: 1.0545718e-34 * 6.2415e9 \u2248 (1.0545718 * 6.2415) x 1e-25.\n\n1.0545718 * 6.2415 \u2248 approximately 6.582. So, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, that's the value I remember. So, \u0127 \u2248 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, let me compute that division: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.\n\nNext, I need to find the gamma factor. Gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, and E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2? Or wait, in natural units, E and m have the same units when c=1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. So, E is the total energy of the particle, which is 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, right? So when calculating gamma, which is E/(m c\u00b2), but if E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) would have units of (GeV)/( (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 ) ) = GeV/(GeV) )= dimensionless, which is correct for gamma.\n\nBut wait, in natural units where c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 \u2192 so E = m. So perhaps in natural units, E and m are numerically the same when c=1. So gamma would be E/m.\n\nSo, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but if E is given as 8 GeV, m as 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 ) ) \u2192 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.\n\nBut wait, alternatively, when using natural units where c=1, E and m have the same numerical value, so E = m \u2192 but here E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV \u2192 gamma = E/(m) = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nYes, makes sense. So gamma is 8 /1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nNow, beta. Beta is v/c. How to find beta?\n\nWe can use the relation between gamma, beta, and mass. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, from energy and momentum: E\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nWe can find p c = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2).\n\nBut again, in natural units, perhaps it's easier. But let's proceed.\n\nIn natural units, E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. Wait, no, more accurately, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \u2192 so, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) \u2192 but in units where c=1, this is p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ). So, in natural units, p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let's compute that.\n\n8^2 =64, 1.2^2=1.44 \u2192 64 -1.44=62.56 \u2192 sqrt(62.56)= approx 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, p =7.91 GeV/c.\n\nThen, beta = (p c)/(E). Because, in natural units, beta = p c / E \u2192 since E = gamma m c\u00b2, and p = gamma m v \u2192 so beta = v/c = (p c)/E.\n\nSo, beta = (p c) / E.\n\nWait, in our case, p is 7.91 GeV/c. So p c = 7.91 GeV/c * c = 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 \u2248 0.98875.\n\nSo, beta is approximately 0.98875.\n\nSo, now we have gamma \u22486.6667 and beta \u22480.98875.\n\nSo, the decay length L is c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Decay length L is the product of the particle's speed (v) multiplied by the lifetime (tau). But since the particle is moving, L = v * tau. But since v = beta c, L = beta c tau.\n\nBut wait, that's the proper time. Wait, no, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma tau. So, the mean decay length is L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nWe have beta \u22480.98875, gamma\u22486.6667, c is the speed of light \u22483e8 m/s, and tau\u22482.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, compute beta * gamma: 0.98875 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's see. 0.98875 *6 is about 5.9325, 0.98875*0.6667\u2248 0.65916, so total approx 6.59166.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u22486.59166.\n\nNow, c*tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s \u2192 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) ) \u2192 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nWait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 *1e-24 \u2192 6.170625 * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nSo, c tau is 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * c tau \u2248 6.59166 * 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nLet me compute 6.59166 *6.170625.\n\n6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.170625 \u22481.02375, 0.59166 *6=3.54996, 0.59166 *0.170625\u2248 0.1009. So adding up: 36 +1.02375=37.02375, 3.54996+0.1009\u22483.65086. Total \u224837.02375 +3.65086\u224840.6746.\n\nWait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps 6.59166 *6.170625 is:\n\nLet me compute 6.59166 *6.170625.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use exact multiplication.\n\n6.59166 \u00d7 6.170625:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n6 \u00d76 =36.\n\n6 \u00d70.170625=1.02375.\n\n0.59166 \u00d76=3.54996.\n\n0.59166 \u00d70.170625\u2248 let's compute 0.59166 *0.170625.\n\n0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.\n\n0.09166 *0.170625\u2248 approximately 0.015625.\n\nSo total is 0.0853125 +0.015625=0.1009375.\n\nSo all together:\n\n36 +1.02375=37.02375.\n\n37.02375 +3.54996=40.57371.\n\n40.57371 +0.1009375\u224840.67465.\n\nSo approximately 40.67465.\n\nSo, 40.67465e-16 m.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because 6.59166 * 6.170625e-16 m is 40.67465e-16 m? Wait, no, no. Oh wait, no! Wait, because 6.59166 is multiplied by 6.170625e-16. So the total is 6.59166 *6.170625e-16 = (6.59166 *6.170625) \u00d71e-16.\n\nWhich is 40.67465 \u00d71e-16 m \u22484.067465e-15 m.\n\nWait, wait, no, 40.67465e-16 meters is 4.067465e-15 meters, because 40e-16 is 4e-15.\n\nSo, L \u22484.067465e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)5.0223 *1e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655 *1e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223 *1e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655 *1e-16 m\n\nSo, my calculation gives approximately 4.067465e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, tau calculation: I had \u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, \u0393=0.32 GeV.\n\nTau = \u0127/\u0393 = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nThen, gamma = E/m =8/1.2=6.666666... \u22486.6667.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) \u2192 because in terms of beta, beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2)/(E\u00b2)}.\n\nSo, m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.\n\nSo, m\u00b2=1.44, E\u00b2=64.\n\n1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.\n\nbeta = sqrt(0.9775) \u22480.9887.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThen, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nWait, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc*tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nThen, beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u22486.5916.\n\nMultiply that by c tau: 6.5916 *6.170625e-16 = ?\n\nCalculating 6.5916 *6.170625:\n\n6 *6=36, 6 *0.170625=1.02375, 0.5916 *6=3.5496, 0.5916 *0.170625\u22480.1009.\n\nAdding up: 36 +1.02375=37.02375 \u2192 37.02375 +3.5496=40.57335 \u2192 40.57335 +0.1009=40.67425.\n\nSo, 40.67425e-16 m =4.067425e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference may be due to more precise calculation of beta and gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I used too many approximations. Let me compute beta more accurately.\n\nCompute beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.\n\n0.9775 \u2192 let's take a calculator approach. 0.98^2=0.9604, 0.988^2= (approx) 0.988 *0.988.\n\n0.98 *0.98 =0.9604, 0.008 *0.98 =0.00784, 0.008*0.98=0.00784, and 0.008^2=0.000064. So (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008\u00b2=0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064=0.976144.\n\nHmm, but 0.9775 is higher than 0.976144. So, let's compute 0.988^2= 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. Let's compute 0.989^2.\n\n0.989^2 = (0.98 +0.009)^2 = 0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.009 +0.009\u00b2 = 0.9604 + 0.01764 +0.000081 = 0.9604 +0.01764=0.97804 + 0.000081=0.978121.\n\nSo 0.989^2 is 0.978121, which is larger than 0.9775.\n\nSo, the square root of 0.9775 is between 0.988 and 0.989.\n\nLet me compute 0.9885^2:\n\n0.9885 = 0.988 +0.0005.\n\n(0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.\n\nWe know 0.988^2 is 0.976144.\n\n2*0.988*0.0005 = 0.988 *0.001=0.000988.\n\n(0.0005)^2=0.00000025.\n\nTotal: 0.976144 +0.000988 =0.977132 +0.00000025=0.97713225.\n\nBut target is 0.9775.\n\nDifference: 0.9775-0.97713225=0.00036775.\n\nSo, to find how much more than 0.9885 is needed.\n\nLet me denote x=0.9885 + delta.\n\nWe have (0.9885 + delta)^2 \u2248 0.9775.\n\nApproximating using delta <<1:\n\n(0.9885)^2 + 2 *0.9885 * delta =0.9775 \u2192 0.97713225 + 1.977 * delta=0.9775.\n\nSo, 1.977 * delta = 0.9775 -0.97713225=0.00036775.\n\ndelta=0.00036775 /1.977 \u2248 0.0001863.\n\nSo, x\u22480.9885 +0.0001863=0.9886863.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775)=\u22480.988686.\n\nSo, beta=0.988686.\n\nNow, gamma=8/1.2=6.666666...=20/3\u22486.666666667.\n\nSo, beta*gamma=6.66666667 * 0.988686.\n\nLet me compute this accurately.\n\n6.66666667 * 0.988686 = ?\n\nWell, 6 * 0.988686 =5.932116.\n\n0.66666667 *0.988686 = approx 0.66666667 *0.988686 \u2192 computing 2/3 * 0.988686 \u2192 approx 0.659124.\n\nSo, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.\n\nSo beta*gamma=6.59124.\n\nNow, tau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nc*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, L= beta gamma * c tau =6.59124 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 6.59124 *6.170625.\n\nLet me compute this multiplication more precisely.\n\n6 *6=36.\n\n6 *0.170625=1.02375.\n\n0.59124 *6=3.54744.\n\n0.59124 *0.170625 \u2192 let's compute this.\n\n0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.\n\n0.09124 *0.170625 \u2192 approx 0.01556.\n\nSo, 0.0853125 +0.01556=0.0100875? Wait, no, 0.0853125 +0.01556=0.1008725.\n\nWait, no, wait: 0.59124 is 0.5 +0.09124.\n\nSo 0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.\n\n0.09124 *0.170625 \u2192 compute 0.09124 *0.170625.\n\n0.09 *0.17=0.0153.\n\n0.09 *0.000625=0.00005625.\n\n0.00124 *0.17=0.0002108.\n\n0.00124 *0.000625=0.000000775.\n\nAdding these:\n\n0.0153 + 0.00005625=0.01535625.\n\n0.0002108 + 0.000000775=0.000211575.\n\nTotal: 0.01535625 +0.000211575=0.015567825.\n\nSo, 0.59124 *0.170625=0.0853125 +0.015567825=0.100880325.\n\nSo, the four terms are:\n\n36 (from 6*6)\n\n1.02375 (from 6*0.170625)\n\n3.54744 (from 0.59124 *6)\n\n0.100880325 (from 0.59124 *0.170625)\n\nAdding all together:\n\n36 +1.02375 =37.02375.\n\n37.02375 +3.54744=40.57119.\n\n40.57119 +0.100880325=40.672070325.\n\nSo, 6.59124 *6.170625=40.672070325.\n\nSo, L=40.672070325e-16 m =4.0672070325e-15 m.\n\nRounded to four decimal places, that's 4.0672e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, so why the small discrepancy? Perhaps I should check the calculation of beta*gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta*gamma. Let me compute 6.6666667 *0.988686 precisely.\n\n6.6666667 *0.988686.\n\nLet me compute 6 *0.988686 =5.932116.\n\n0.6666667 *0.988686 \u2192 2/3 *0.988686.\n\nCompute 0.988686 /3=0.329562. Multiply by 2 \u21920.659124.\n\nSo, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124 exactly.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. Then why is the answer 4.0672e-15 m, and the option is 4.0655e-15 m?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the c*tau product. Let me recalculate c*tau.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 = (3 *2.056875) *1e(8-24) \u2192 6.170625 *1e-16 \u2192 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, 6.59124 *6.170625e-16 =40.67207e-16=4.067207e-15 m.\n\nBut option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta or gamma.\n\nWait, let me recheck gamma.\n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but in natural units, E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 \u2192 E/(m c\u00b2) =8/(1.2) =6.666666... correct.\n\nBeta calculation: beta = p c / E.\n\nWait, another approach to find beta is sqrt(1- (m^2)/(E^2)}.\n\nBut perhaps I should use the relation beta = (pc)/E, where p is the momentum.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute p c = sqrt( E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) \u2192 but in natural units, with c=1, p c = sqrt(E\u00b2 -m\u00b2) GeV.\n\nSo, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV \u2192 p c = sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, beta= (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed beta via sqrt(0.9775), I got 0.988686. Hmm, wait, that's a discrepancy. Which is correct?\n\nWait, because (p c)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4 \u2192 when c=1, (p c)^2 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2).\n\nSo, p c = sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, beta = (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), I got 0.988686.\n\nWait, let me compute m\u00b2/E\u00b2 again. m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV \u2192 m\u00b2=1.44, E\u00b2=64. So m\u00b2/E\u00b2=0.0225.\n\n1-0.0225=0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nHmm, but according to the other method, beta=7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nWait, that's a slight discrepancy. Which is correct?\n\nAh, wait, because when m and E are in GeV, and when we have beta = (p c)/E \u2192 but when using natural units, perhaps the calculation is accurate.\n\nWait, 7.91 /8 is 0.98875.\n\nBut sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988686.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 0.98875 squared.\n\n0.98875^2 = (0.98 +0.00875)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98 *0.00875 +0.00875^2.\n\n0.98^2=0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.00875=0.98 *0.0175=0.01715.\n\n0.00875^2=0.0000765625.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 +0.01715=0.97755 +0.0000765625=0.9776265625.\n\nWhich is higher than 0.9775. So, 0.98875^2=0.9776265625, which is higher than 0.9775.\n\nSo, the actual sqrt(0.9775)=x, where x^2=0.9775.\n\nGiven that x is between 0.988686 (x^2=0.9775) and 0.98875 (x^2=0.9776265625).\n\nBut which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact expression.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} ) = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ).\n\nSo, from this formula, beta should be sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64))=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988686.\n\nBut from the other approach, it's 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps because in the first approach, I neglected that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \u2192 so, when I compute pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4), but if I'm using GeV for E and m, but in natural units, c=1, so E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, this is getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute beta as (p c) / E, but with p c in GeV.\n\nBecause E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 but when c=1, E=gamma m.\n\nAnd p = gamma m v \u2192 so beta = v/c = (p c)/(gamma m c^2) ) = (p c)/(E).\n\nSo, yes, beta is (p c)/E.\n\nWhich is 7.91 GeV /8 GeV =0.98875.\n\nBut wait, in the other approach, we have beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2/(E^2)} ) \u2192 which, with c=1, is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nBut why are these two values slightly different? Because (p c) is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4), which when divided by E gives sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ), which is the same as the other formula.\n\nWait, so they should agree. So perhaps an error in calculation.\n\nWait, wait, I think I see the mistake.\n\nWait, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 but E and m are in different units. E is in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should convert m into GeV as well, considering units.\n\nWait, the mass m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, m c\u00b2 in GeV is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 =1.2 GeV.\n\nSo, E=8 GeV.\n\nThus, (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 =64 -1.44=62.56 \u2192 pc=7.91 GeV.\n\nSo, beta = (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nBut then, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ), which is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)} )=sqrt(1 - 1.44/64)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988686.\n\nHmm, so why are these two approaches giving slightly different beta?\n\nAh, because when I compute m^2, I'm using m in GeV/c\u00b2. But when I compute (m c^2)^2, it's (1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c^2)^2= (1.2 GeV)^2.\n\nSo, the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - m^2/(E^2)} ).\n\nBut in reality:\n\nm =1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 \u2192 m c^2=1.2 GeV.\n\nSo, (m c^2)^2= (1.2 GeV)^2 =1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nE^2=64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo, beta= sqrt(1 -1.44/64)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nBut when I compute beta as (p c)/E, I get pc=7.91 GeV, E=8 GeV \u2192 beta=0.98875.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, the correct approach is to use beta = (p c)/E, which is 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nBut then, why does the other approach give 0.988686?\n\nAh, I think I messed up something.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate sqrt(0.9775).\n\n0.9775 \u2192 let's compute it accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775):\n\n0.988^2=0.976144.\n\n0.9885^2= (0.988 +0.0005)^2=0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 +0.0005^2=0.976144 +0.000988 +0.00000025=0.97713225.\n\n0.9775 is 0.00036775 higher.\n\nSo, each 0.0001 increase in x leads to an increase in x\u00b2 of approximately 2x * delta_x.\n\nSo, let x=0.9885 \u2192 x\u00b2=0.97713225.\n\nWe need x\u00b2=0.9775 \u2192 delta_x\u00b2=0.9775 -0.97713225=0.00036775.\n\ndelta_x \u2248 delta_x\u00b2/(2x) \u2192 0.00036775/(2*0.9885)=0.00036775/(1.977)\u22480.0001863.\n\nSo, x=0.9885+0.0001863=0.9886863.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775)=0.9886863.\n\nBut according to the other method, using (p c)/E gives 0.98875.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 0.98875 -0.9886863=0.0000637.\n\nWhere is this coming from?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pc.\n\nWait, pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2}.\n\nE=8 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV \u2192 E^2=64, (m c^2)^2=1.44.\n\n64-1.44=62.56 \u2192 sqrt(62.56)=7.91.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, 7.91^2=62.56?\n\n7.91 *7.91.\n\n7 *7=49.\n\n7 *0.91=6.37.\n\n0.91*7=6.37.\n\n0.91*0.91=0.8281.\n\nSo, 7.91^2 = (7 +0.91)^2 =7^2 +2*7*0.91 +0.91^2=49 +12.74 +0.8281=49+12.74=61.74+0.8281=62.5681.\n\nSo, 7.91^2=62.5681, which is slightly higher than 62.56.\n\nSo, pc= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV? No, because 7.91^2=62.5681. So, sqrt(62.56)=7.909999... approximately 7.91 GeV.\n\nWait, so maybe (pc)=7.91 GeV exactly? Because if E is in GeV and m c\u00b2 is in GeV, then pc is in GeV.\n\nSo, beta = pc/E =7.91 /8=0.98875.\n\nBut according to the other method, beta is sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nSo, there's a small discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nHmm, perhaps because using E and m in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, but when calculating in natural units, perhaps I need to consider more precise factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to not rely on approximations but to compute it precisely.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps using beta =0.98875 is more accurate because it's derived directly from the particle's energy and momentum.\n\nSo, perhaps I should proceed with beta=0.98875 and gamma=6.666666667.\n\nThen, L= beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nbeta*gamma=6.666666667 *0.98875=6.666666667 *0.98875.\n\nLet me compute that precisely.\n\n6.666666667 *0.98875.\n\nWe can compute it as 6.666666667 * (98875/1e5) \u2192 but perhaps it's easier to compute 6.666666667 *0.98875.\n\n6.666666667 *0.98875 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 *0.98875=5.9325.\n\n0.666666667 *0.98875= let's compute:\n\n0.666666667 is 2/3.\n\n2/3 *0.98875= (0.98875 *2)/3 =1.9775 /3=0.6591666667.\n\nSo, 5.9325 +0.6591666667=6.5916666667.\n\nSo, beta*gamma=6.5916666667.\n\nNow, c*tau=6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo, L=6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 6.5916666667 *6.170625.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n6 *6=36.\n\n6 *0.170625=1.02375.\n\n0.5916666667 *6=3.55.\n\n0.5916666667 *0.170625= as before, 0.100880325.\n\nSo, adding all parts:\n\n36 +1.02375=37.02375.\n\n37.02375 +3.55=40.57375.\n\n40.57375 +0.100880325=40.674630325.\n\nSo, 40.674630325e-16 m =4.0674630325e-15 m.\n\nSo, L\u22484.067463e-15 m.\n\nBut the closest option is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, the slight discrepancy may be due to more precise calculation of beta, or perhaps I made an error in the initial values.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial value of tau was miscalculated.\n\nTau = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWe had \u0127 =6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma=0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the mean decay length as L = c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nWait, but perhaps the formula is L = c * gamma * beta * tau.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nBut I think that's the same thing.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime is tau= \u0127/\u0393.\n\nThe lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nThe distance traveled is v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWhich is L= beta gamma c tau.\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct, but the answer isn't matching exactly with option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should use exact values with more precise beta.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation of beta is 0.988686, and gamma is 6.666666667.\n\nBeta*gamma=6.666666667 *0.988686=?\n\nCompute precisely:\n\n6.666666667 *0.988686.\n\n=6 *0.988686 +0.666666667 *0.988686.\n\n=5.932116 + (0.666666667 *0.988686).\n\nCompute 0.666666667 *0.988686:\n\n= (2/3) *0.988686 = (0.988686 *2)/3 =1.977372/3=0.659124.\n\nSo, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.\n\nSo, beta*gamma=6.59124.\n\nNow, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo, L=6.59124 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 6.59124 *6.170625= ?\n\nLet me compute 6.59124 \u00d76.170625.\n\nCompute as:\n\n6.59124 \u00d76 =39.54744.\n\n6.59124 \u00d70.170625.\n\nCompute 6.59124 \u00d70.1 =0.659124.\n\n6.59124 \u00d70.070625.\n\n0.07 is 0.07, 0.000625 is 0.000625.\n\n6.59124 \u00d70.07=0.4613868.\n\n6.59124 \u00d70.000625=0.004119525.\n\nSo, adding those: 0.659124 +0.4613868=1.1205108 +0.004119525=1.124630325.\n\nSo, 6.59124 \u00d70.170625=1.124630325.\n\nTotal 6.59124 \u00d76.170625 =39.54744 +1.124630325=40.672070325.\n\nSo, L=40.672070325e-16 m=4.0672070325e-15 m.\n\nSo, 4.0672e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nThe difference is about 0.0017e-15, which is small but not negligible. Perhaps due to rounding errors in the calculation of beta and gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for \u0127.\n\nWait, \u0127 is approximately 6.58233e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nIf I use 6.58233e-25, then tau=6.58233e-25 /0.32 =20.56978125e-25=2.056978125e-24 s.\n\nSo, tau=2.056978125e-24 s.\n\nc*tau=3e8 m/s * 2.056978125e-24 s =6.170934375e-16 m.\n\nNow, beta*gamma=6.59124.\n\nSo, L=6.59124 \u00d76.170934375e-16.\n\nCompute 6.59124 *6.170934375.\n\n6 *6=36.\n\n6 *0.170934375=1.02560625.\n\n0.59124 *6=3.54744.\n\n0.59124 *0.170934375= let's compute.\n\nCompute 0.5 *0.170934375=0.0854671875.\n\n0.09124 *0.170934375= approx 0.01558.\n\nSo, 0.0854671875 +0.01558=0.1010471875.\n\nAdding all four parts:\n\n36 +1.02560625=37.02560625.\n\n37.02560625 +3.54744=40.57304625.\n\n40.57304625 +0.1010471875=40.6740934375e-16 m.\n\nSo, L=40.6740934375e-16=4.06740934375e-15 m.\n\nStill around 4.0674e-15 m.\n\nSo, the options don't have this, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done using the natural unit conversion for decay length.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length L is given by (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).\n\nSo, c*tau is the product of speed of light and proper lifetime.\n\nBut wait, the proper lifetime is tau, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau.\n\nSo, the distance is v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWhich is what I've been using.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean decay length as L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).\n\nWhich is what I've done.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer expects using the value of beta as 0.988686 and gamma as 6.666666667, leading to beta*gamma=6.59123.\n\nThen, L=6.59123 *6.170625e-16=40.67205e-16=4.067205e-15 m.\n\nWhich is 4.0672e-15 m.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close but not exactly the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation for beta and gamma.\n\nLet me compute gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666666666666667.\n\nBeta= sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686383.\n\nSo, beta=0.988686383.\n\nThen, beta * gamma=6.666666666666667 *0.988686383=?\n\nCompute 6 *0.988686383=5.932118298.\n\n0.666666666666667 *0.988686383=0.659124255.\n\nTotal=5.932118298 +0.659124255=6.591242553.\n\nSo, beta*gamma=6.591242553.\n\nNow, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24=6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo, L=6.591242553 *6.170625e-16=40.67207e-16 m=4.067207e-15 m.\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer expects using the width in MeV, but I used 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, no, the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the value of Planck's constant in a different way.\n\nAlternative approach: Decay length L is given by L = (c * \u0127) / (Gamma) ) * (E/(m)) * (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2} )).\n\nWait, perhaps that's another way to write it.\n\nBut I think I've covered all possible approaches.\n\nGiven that, the calculation leads me to approximately 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo why is there a discrepancy? Maybe it's due to using \u0127 as 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s instead of a more precise value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact question uses different constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise \u0127.\n\nThe exact value of \u0127 is approximately 6.58233 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nUsing that, tau=6.58233e-25 /0.32=20.56978125e-25=2.056978125e-24 s.\n\nc*tau=3e8 *2.056978125e-24 =6.170934375e-16 m.\n\nThen, beta*gamma=6.591242553.\n\nSo, L=6.591242553 *6.170934375e-16 =40.67409e-16=4.067409e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.0674e-15 m.\n\nBut the option is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects using beta=0.98875 and gamma=6.666667, leading to L=4.0674e-15, but this isn't an option. The closest is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should have used E = m + something else, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in units when calculating tau.\n\nWait, tau= \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWait, Gamma is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, Gamma=320 MeV=0.32 GeV.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta) \u2192 but perhaps the calculation should use more precise values for beta and gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach: The decay length L is given by L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).\n\nBut perhaps, in some sources, the formula is L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta) * c.\n\nWait, no, because beta is in terms of c.\n\nWait, no, L = v * t \u2192 v = beta c, t= gamma tau.\n\nSo, L= beta c gamma tau.\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but in reality, it's 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, so when calculating E = gamma m c\u00b2, the units could affect.\n\nBut earlier, I think I accounted for that by ensuring that when c=1, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2, so E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 which with c=1, is E/(m).\n\nSo, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic relation for decay length.\n\nWait, I'm a bit stuck. Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.\n\nWait, another check: compute 7.91/8=0.98875.\n\nBut using the other method, beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nSo, a small discrepancy, but which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct beta is 0.98875 because it's derived from the exact momentum and energy relation.\n\nSo, in that case, the calculated L is approximately 4.067e-15 m.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using beta=0.98875, leading to the calculated L around 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should have used 1.2 GeV as the mass, leading to gamma=8/(1.2)=6.6666667, beta= sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.\n\nSo, beta*gamma=6.6666667 *0.988686=6.59124.\n\nc*tau=6.170625e-16 m.\n\nSo, L=6.59124 *6.170625e-16=4.067207e-15 m.\n\nBut, again, the closest option is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:5.0223e-15 m, but that's much higher.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, gamma=8/(1.2) =6.666666667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach\u2014maybe the problem is using the relativistic formula for the mean path length, which is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation involves the particle's velocity and lifetime.\n\nBut I think I've covered all the possibilities. Given that, I think option B is the correct choice, despite the slight discrepancy in the calculation.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance \\( L \\) of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)),\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\)\nThe width \\( \\Gamma \\) is given as \\( 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X, mass m_X, and width \u0393_X. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle can be found using the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a particle to its energy uncertainty. The formula I think is \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0393 is the width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy.\n\nBut wait, what's the relation between the decay width and the mean lifetime? Oh yeah, the total decay width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 by \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, \u0393 is given in MeV, so I have to convert that into appropriate units.\n\nAlso, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity of the particle and the mean lifetime. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with a certain energy, I can find its velocity from that. The energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So I should calculate the relativistic gamma factor.\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but m is given in GeV/c\u00b2? Or is m in GeV? Oh, I think in particle physics, masses are often given in GeV/c\u00b2, but sometimes just GeV. Wait, no, the units are usually GeV/c\u00b2. So, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. Then E_X is 8 GeV, which is the total energy.\n\nSo gamma, \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so about 6.6667.\n\nThen the velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Hmm, wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2. Therefore, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2).\n\nLet me compute that. Gamma is 6.6667. So gamma squared is about 44.4444. 1/(gamma squared) is 1/44.4444 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v \u2248 c * 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. So roughly, v \u2248 2.96e8 m/s (since c is ~3e8 m/s).\n\nNow, let's find the lifetime \u03c4. The width \u0393 is 320 MeV. But wait, I remember that in natural units, \u0127 c is about 197.3 MeV fm (femtometers), but perhaps I should convert everything into SI units.\n\nWait, but the formula \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0393 is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-24 seconds is a very short time, but that's typical for particles with short lifetimes. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but then I have to be careful with units.\n\nWait, another approach: in particle physics, the decay width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 by \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0393 is in MeV, and \u0127 is in MeV\u00b7s when using appropriate units. Wait, because \u0127 c \u2248 197.3 MeV\u00b7fm, so \u0127 = 197.3 MeV\u00b7fm / c. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's easier to compute everything in natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean decay length formula, which is L \u2248 c * \u03c4 * v. Wait, so that's the velocity multiplied by the lifetime.\n\nSo, L = v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have v \u2248 0.9887c, and \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, but let me compute \u03c4 properly.\n\n\u0393 is given as 320 MeV. Let me compute \u03c4 in seconds.\n\n\u0393 (in MeV) = 320 MeV.\n\nIn natural units, where c=1 and \u0127=1, the relation is \u0393 (in MeV) = 1/(\u03c4 (in seconds)) * \u0127 c^5 / (1.519e-24 MeV\u00b7s)).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute \u0393 in seconds^-1.\n\nWait, no, alternative approach:\n\nWe know that \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me convert \u0393 from MeV to J.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV, so 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\n\u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s / 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nCalculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, compute the decay length L = v * \u03c4.\n\nv \u2248 0.9887c \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s \u2248 6.103e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but none of the options are exactly 6e-16 m. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5.0223 *10^-16 m\n\nB) 4.0655 *10^-15 m\n\nC) 5.0223 *10^-15 m\n\nD) 4.0655 *10^-16 m\n\nHmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16 m, but that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me re-calculate the gamma and velocity.\n\nE_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nSo beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) \u2192 sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887c \u2192 ~2.966e8 m/s.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should be using the total energy more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic equations more carefully.\n\nWait, another approach: The mean decay length is given by L = (c * \u03c4) * beta gamma.\n\nWait, alternatively, I think L = v * \u03c4. So v is beta * c, so L = beta * c * \u03c4.\n\nWait, but in that case, L = beta * c * (\u0127 / \u0393).\n\nWait, let me compute beta * c * \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBeta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s. So beta c is 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) )\n\nWait, but wait, that's the same as 2.966e8 * (1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 )\n\nWhich is 2.966e8 * (2.057e-24) \u2192 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = ~6.1e-16 m. As before.\n\nHmm, but the options are A: ~5e-16, D: ~4e-16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.\n\nWait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E_X/(m_X c\u00b2). But wait, in natural units, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2, so E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) ) \u2192 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667, as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the energy as the rest energy plus kinetic energy, but in this case E is the total energy, so that's correct.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps I should have considered the particle's velocity in terms of the momentum. Maybe a better approach. The energy E is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So the momentum p is sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c.\n\nWait, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2).\n\nSo p = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) / (c).\n\nWait, 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.\n\nSo p = sqrt(62.56 GeV\u00b2) / c \u2192 sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV/c.\n\nSo p = 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nThen, the velocity can be found from p = gamma m v \u2192 v = (p c) / (gamma m).\n\nWait, but gamma is E/(m c\u00b2)= 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.\n\nWait, but let's compute beta (v/c):\n\nbeta = p c / (E) \u2192 since E = gamma m c\u00b2, and p = gamma m v \u2192 v = beta c.\n\nSo p c = gamma m beta c\u00b2 \u2192 p c = beta gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nBut E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 so p c = (beta) E \u2192 beta = (p c) / E.\n\nSo p is 7.91 GeV/c \u2192 p c = 7.91 GeV.\n\nE is 8 GeV \u2192 beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.\n\nSo same result as before. So beta is approximately 0.98875.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation of the lifetime is correct, but perhaps I should express it in terms of other constants.\n\nWait, another approach: The lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But I need to make sure that \u0127 is in the right units.\n\nWait, when \u0393 is in MeV, \u0127 in MeV\u00b7s.\n\nWhat's \u0127 in MeV\u00b7s? Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and \u0127 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s \u2192 so \u0127 in MeV\u00b7s:\n\n\u0127 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) ) \u2192 because 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J.\n\nWait, 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s / (1.602e-13 J/MeV) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 MeV\u00b7s \u2248 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, so \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 MeV\u00b7s? Wait, wait, no:\n\nWait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.\n\nSo \u0127 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) * (1 MeV)/(1.602e-13 J) ) \u2192 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 \u2248 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, so \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 MeV\u00b7s? Wait, no. Let me compute:\n\n1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s / 1.602e-13 J/MeV = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 \u2248 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, so \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 MeV\u00b7s? Wait no, 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s is correct.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s) / (320 MeV) \u2192 6.582e-22 / 320 \u2248 2.0569e-24 seconds.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo now, L = v * \u03c4 = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.0569e-24 s) \u2192 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.0569e-24 \u2192 Let's compute this.\n\nMultiply 2.966e8 and 2.0569e-24:\n\n2.966 * 2.0569 \u2248 6.113, and exponents: 10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16.\n\nSo 6.113e-16 meters.\n\nHmm, but none of the options are exactly 6e-16. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: 5.0223e-16 m.\n\nOption D: 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Earlier I approximated sqrt(0.9775) as 0.9887. Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nCalculate 0.9775: sqrt(0.9775).\n\nI'll use a calculator approach. Let's think of sqrt(0.9775).\n\nI know that 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, but let me compute 0.9887^2.\n\n0.9887 *0.9887:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nBut let me compute accurately:\n\n0.9887^2 = (0.9800 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.\n\n0.9604 + 2*(0.98*0.0087) + 0.00007569.\n\n0.9604 + 2*(0.008484) )= 0.9604 + 0.016968 = 0.977368, plus 0.00007569 \u2192 0.97744369.\n\nHmm, but 0.9775 is a bit higher. So sqrt(0.9775) would be slightly higher than 0.9887.\n\nWait, 0.9775 is 0.9775.\n\nWait, perhaps 0.9887^2 is 0.9775 exactly? Well, let me compute 0.9887 *0.9887 precisely.\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887:\n\nLet me compute 9887 * 9887.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way: (a + b)^2 where a= 9800, b=87.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.\n\nWait, 0.9887 * 0.9887 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887.\n\n= (0.98 + 0.0087) * (0.98 + 0.0087)\n= 0.98\u00b2 + 2 *0.98 *0.0087 + 0.0087\u00b2\n= 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569\n= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569\n= 0.9604 + 0.01712769\n= 0.97752769.\n\nSo 0.9887^2 \u2248 0.977528, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product v * tau.\n\nWait, let me recompute v * tau.\n\nv is approximately 0.9887c, which is 2.966e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s \u2192 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e8 * 1e-24.\n\n2.966 * 2.057 = let me compute this precisely.\n\n2 * 2.057 = 4.114.\n\n0.966 * 2.057 \u2248 approx 0.966 *2 =1.932, 0.966 *0.057\u22480.055 \u2192 total approx 1.987.\n\nSo total 4.114 +1.987=6.101.\n\nSo 6.101 * 1e-16 \u2192 6.101e-16 meters.\n\nSo about 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have this value.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have used the production energy E_X as the total energy but considered something else.\n\nWait, another thought: the production energy is the energy at which the meson is produced, but does that affect the calculation? Or is the energy used to calculate gamma correct? I think so because the decay length depends on the lifetime and velocity, which are determined by the mass and decay width.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should use the square of the decay width? No, I don't think so. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered the natural line width and used the formula with c and \u0127 correctly. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length can be calculated using the formula L = c * \u03c4 * v. So \u03c4 is \u0127 / (\u0393), and v is beta c.\n\nSo L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * beta.\n\nSo substituting, L = (beta) * \u0127 c / \u0393.\n\nHmm, but \u0127 c is a known value. Let me remember that \u0127 c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nWait, that's a useful constant. So \u0127 c = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo, L = (beta) * (\u0127 c) / (\u0393) ) \u2192 (beta) * (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / (\u0393 in MeV) ).\n\nBut wait, I need to convert fm to meters. 1 fm is 1e-15 m.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nbeta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.9887 * (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / 320 MeV.\n\nThe MeV units cancel out.\n\nSo, (0.9887 * 197.33 ) / 320 \u2192 compute numerator.\n\n0.9887 *197.33 \u2248 0.9887 *200 = 197.74 minus 0.9887*(2.67) \u2192 approx 197.74 \u2013 2.65 \u2248 195.09.\n\nSo 195.09 fm / 320 \u2192 approx 0.6096 fm.\n\nWait, 0.6096 fm is 0.6096e-15 meters \u2192 6.096e-16 meters.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m, same as before. But again, the options don't match this.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, it's 6.096e-16 m, which is approximately 6.1e-16 m, but the options are 5e-16 and 4e-16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in using \u0127 c. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, \u0127 c is approximately 197.327 MeV\u00b7fm. So,\n\nL = (0.9887) * (197.327) / 320 \u2192 let's compute 0.9887 *197.327.\n\n0.9887 * 200 = 197.74. But since 197.327 is 2.673 less than 200.\n\nSo 0.9887 * 197.327 \u2192 0.9887*(200 -2.673) = 197.74 - (0.9887 *2.673).\n\n0.9887 * 2.673 \u2192 approx 2.643.\n\nSo 197.74 -2.643= 195.097.\n\nSo 195.097 / 320 = approx 0.609678 fm \u2192 0.609678e-15 m \u2192 6.09678e-16 m.\n\nWait, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 5.0223e-16 m \u2192 5.02e-16.\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m.\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m.\n\nD)4.0655e-16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include the factor of 1/c somewhere. Wait, in the formula for L, perhaps it's (\u0127 / (\u0393 c)) multiplied by something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The decay width \u0393 is given in MeV, which is energy. The lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. But in natural units, \u03c4 = \u0127_bar / \u0393, where \u0127_bar is in MeV s.\n\nWait, but when you're calculating the decay length, which is a distance, you have to make sure the units are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the natural units approach where c=1 and \u0127=1, then convert to meters.\n\nWait, in natural units, L = v * tau. v is in terms of c, and tau is in seconds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me think of the formula as L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nSo, c is in m/s, tau in seconds, so c*tau is meters, multiplied by beta (dimensionless).\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nL = (beta c) * tau.\n\nBut that's the same as v * tau.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute beta and c*tau separately.\n\nWait, beta c for this particle is 0.9887 *3e8 m/s \u2192 approximately 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.103e-16 meters.\n\nBut again, the same result.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the gamma factor. Let me check that again.\n\nE_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo E = gamma m c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for lifetime. Because the lifetime in the particle's rest frame is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. Then, the observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me try that.\n\nThe proper lifetime tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThen, the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo L = v * tau = v * gamma * tau_0.\n\nBut v is beta c, so,\n\nL = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 so,\n\nL = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nThen, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is v * (gamma tau_0) = beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, but beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma \u2192 which is (gamma v)/c. Hmm, but gamma v/c = gamma beta.\n\nWait, I think another way to write beta gamma is gamma beta. So,\n\nbeta gamma = (gamma v)/c.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I should be using is L = c * tau * beta gamma.\n\nWait, because L = v * tau = (beta c) * tau.\n\nAnd tau = gamma tau_0.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, but in natural units, c=1 and \u0127=1, so L = beta gamma / Gamma.\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula L = (beta gamma) * (\u0127 c) / Gamma.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta gamma = (0.9887) * 6.6667 \u2248 6.611.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta gamma \u22486.611.\n\nThen,\n\nL = (6.611) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (320 MeV) \u2192 6.611 *197.33 / 320 fm.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 6.611 *197.33 \u2248 approx 1307.6.\n\nSo 1307.6 /320 \u22484.086 fm.\n\nWhich is 4.086e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, but wait, that's 4.086e-15, but the option is about 4.065e-15.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approximation for beta gamma is a bit off.\n\nWait, let me compute beta gamma more accurately.\n\nBeta =0.9887, gamma=6.66666667.\n\nSo beta * gamma =0.9887 *6.66666667 \u2192 let me compute.\n\n0.9887 *6 =5.9322.\n\n0.9887 *0.66666667\u22480.9887 * (2/3) \u22480.6591.\n\nSo total approx 5.9322 +0.6591=6.5913.\n\nSo beta gamma\u22486.5913.\n\nSo,\n\nL=6.5913 *197.33 /320.\n\nCompute 6.5913 *197.33.\n\n6.5913 * 200 =1318.26.\n\nBut 197.33 is 2.67 less than 200.\n\nSo 6.5913 *197.33= 6.5913*(200-2.67)= 1318.26 - (6.5913 *2.67).\n\nCompute 6.5913 *2.67:\n\n6 *2.67=16.02.\n\n0.5913 *2.67\u22481.574.\n\nTotal\u224817.594.\n\nSo 1318.26 -17.594\u22481300.666.\n\nSo L=1300.666 /320 fm.\n\n1300.666 / 320 \u2192 approx 4.0646 fm \u21924.0646e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nAh! So the correct answer is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, in this approach, L is 4.0646e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed using velocity and tau directly, I got about 6e-16 m. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I now see the mistake. Earlier, I used tau = \u0127 / Gamma, but perhaps I should have used the total decay width in the lab frame, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula incorporates the relativistic gamma factor.\n\nWait, so the proper mean lifetime is tau_0= \u0127 / Gamma. Then, in the lab frame, tau=gamma tau_0.\n\nSo the decay length is v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nBut tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma \u2192 so,\n\nL= beta c gamma (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWhich we can write as L = (beta gamma) (\u0127 c) / Gamma.\n\nBecause \u0127 c is in MeV fm, when Gamma is in MeV, the units work out.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (beta gamma) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (Gamma in MeV).\n\nSo,\n\nbeta gamma = 0.9887 *6.6667 \u22486.591.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL =6.591 *197.33 /320 fm.\n\nWhich we calculated as approximately 4.0646 fm \u21924.0646e-15 meters.\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the relativistic formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\n### Given Data:\n- Production energy: \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n- Mass: \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\)\n- Decay width: \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\)\n1. **Relativistic factor \\(\\gamma\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667\n   \\]\n\n2. **Velocity factor \\(\\beta\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the decay width in natural units\nThe decay width \\(\\Gamma\\) is given as \\(320 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).
