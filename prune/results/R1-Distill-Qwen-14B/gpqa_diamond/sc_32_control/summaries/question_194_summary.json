      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). But wait, in this case, the energy is already given with a negative sign, so maybe that affects things.\n\nEach spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me think: each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if different. So the sum of these three terms can be... Let's see. Let me consider all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think about the possible values of the sum. Since each S_i is \u00b11, the product S_i S_j is also \u00b11. So each term in the sum can be +1 or -1. But the sum of three such terms can vary.\n\nWait, but the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can have different possible values. Let me find the possible values.\n\nLet me take some examples:\n\nCase 1: All spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1.\n\nThen S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nCase 3: One spin is +1, two are -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, wait, that gives me a sum of -1. Wait, in case 2, the sum was -1, and case 3 also gives -1. What about when all are -1?\n\nCase 4: S1=S2=S3=-1.\n\nThen each product is 1, so sum is 3.\n\nHmm, that's the same as case 1.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities. Let's see: suppose two of them are opposite. Another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = 1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, another possibility: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is 3.\n\nWhat about when exactly two of the products are 1 and one is -1? Or maybe I should think of this differently.\n\nWait, the sum can take on different values. Let me think of all possible cases and the sum.\n\nPossible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, wait, let me list all possible states and their sums:\n\nTotal number of states is 8. Let me list each possibility:\n\n1. All +1: S1=1, S2=1, S3=1 --> sum = 1+1+1 =3.\n\n2. Two +1, one -1: Let's try S3=-1.\n\nS1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum = 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nWait, but that's sum=-1.\n\n3. Another case: S2=-1, others +1.\n\nS1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1+1-1 =-1.\n\nSame as above.\n\n4. S3=-1, others +1: sum is same as above.\n\n5. Now, let's have one +1 and two -1.\n\nS1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1.\n\nSame sum as before.\n\nWait a minute, so when two are -1, sum is -1.\n\nWait, another case: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1-1-1 =-1.\n\nSame sum again.\n\nAnother case: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\nSo in all cases where exactly one spin is different, the sum is -1.\n\nWait, but I thought there's a possibility where the sum could be 1. Let me check another possibility.\n\nWait, what about when two of the products are -1 and one is +1. That would give sum= -1 + (-1) +1= -1.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing a case where the sum is +1.\n\nWait, perhaps when all three spins are in a triplet state, but no, that's more for spin-1/2 systems. Wait, no, in this case, all spins are \u00b11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering possible values of the sum.\n\nThe sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term is \u00b11, so sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, let's think: when two terms are 1 and one is -1, sum is 1.\n\nWhen one term is 1, and two are -1, sum is -1.\n\nWhen all three are 1, sum is 3.\n\nWhen all three are -1, sum is -3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Each term is either +1 or -1.\n\nSo the sum can take on possible values of 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nSo let me find how many states give each sum.\n\nSum=3: When all three products are 1. So S1=S2=S3.\n\nWhich can be either all +1 or all -1. So two states: (+,+,+), (-,-,-).\n\nSo for sum=3, number of states is 2. Energy E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nWait, but wait, the energy is E = -J [sum], right? So E = -J (sum), where sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nSo when sum=3, E = -3J. So the exponential factor is exp(\u03b2*3J), because Z is sum exp(-\u03b2 E), since E is negative, it becomes positive exponent.\n\nWait, no: Z is sum exp( -\u03b2 E ), and E is -J sum, so -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J sum.\n\nSo for each state, the exponent is \u03b2 J sum.\n\nWait, so let's get back. Let's find how many states have sum=3, sum=1, sum=-1, sum=-3.\n\nSum=3: two states.\n\nSum=1: how many? Let's see when the sum is 1.\n\nSum=1: that would require two terms to be +1 and one to be -1. So the sum would be 1 +1 -1 =1.\n\nWait, but wait, each term is S_i S_j. So what configurations of spins lead to two 1's and one -1 in the sum.\n\nWait, for example: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So that's sum=-1.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: perhaps the sum can be 1 in some other way.\n\nWait, let me pick S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nThen S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as before. So in this case, when two spins are same and the third is different, the sum is -1.\n\nWhen two spins are different and the third is same, same sum.\n\nWait, maybe the sum can only be 3, -1, and -3.\n\nWait, let's think of another case. Suppose all three spins are arranged such that each pair is opposite. But wait, that's not possible with three spins.\n\nWait, for three spins, can you have all pairwise products being -1? Let's see:\n\nIf S1=-S2, S1=-S3, S2=-S3.\n\nWait, but if S1=-S2, and S1=-S3, then S2 must be equal to S3.\n\nSo S2=S3 and S1=-S2.\n\nThen S2S3 = 1, since they are same.\n\nBut then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.\n\nSo sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSo the sum can't be -3, unless all three products are -1.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because if all three products are -1, then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSo from S1S2=-1, S1=-S2.\n\nFrom S1S3=-1, S1=-S3.\n\nSo S2 = S3.\n\nBut then S2S3= S2^2 = 1, because S2 is either +1 or -1. So S2S3=1.\n\nWhich contradicts S2S3=-1. So it's impossible for all three products to be -1.\n\nTherefore, the sum cannot be -3. So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought sum=1 was possible, but in the examples I tried, it wasn't. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be 1, 3, and -3?\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe I should compute all possible states.\n\nThere are 8 states, so let's list each and compute the sum.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1):\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum = 3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1):\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1-1-1 = -1.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1):\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum=-1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. (+1, -1, -1):\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum=-1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\n5. (-1, +1, +1):\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum=-1 -1 +1= -1.\n\n6. (-1, +1, -1):\n\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum=-1 +1 -1= -1.\n\n7. (-1, -1, +1):\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1 -1 -1=-1.\n\n8. (-1, -1, -1):\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3.\n\nSo looking at all 8 states, the sum is 3 in two cases (1 and 8), and -1 in the other six. There are no states with sum=1, which I thought was possible earlier. So the possible sums are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that's a bit of a surprise. So sum can be 3 (two states) and -1 (six states). So the possible energies are E = -J * sum. So for sum=3, E = -3J. For sum=-1, E = J.\n\nWait, because E = -J * sum.\n\nSo for sum=3, E = -3J.\n\nFor sum=-1, E = (-J)*(-1) = J.\n\nSo each state with sum=3 contributes exp(\u03b2 * 3J), because Z is sum exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(\u03b2 * sum * J) because E = -J sum.\n\nSimilarly, states with sum=-1 contribute exp(\u03b2 * J), since E = J, but exp(-\u03b2 E) would be exp(-\u03b2 J), wait.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The energy E is given by E = -J [sum].\n\nSo for sum=3, E = -3J.\n\nSo in Z, each state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp( \u03b2 *3J ).\n\nFor sum=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nBecause E is given as E = -J [sum].\n\nSo for each state, the exponent in the partition function is exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp( \u03b2 J sum ), because:\n\n-\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 * (-J sum) = \u03b2 J sum.\n\nSo for sum=3: exponent is \u03b2 J *3.\n\nFor sum=-1: exponent is \u03b2 J * (-1) = -\u03b2 J.\n\nNow, the number of states for each sum:\n\nsum=3: 2 states.\n\nsum=-1: 6 states.\n\nSo Z is sum over all states of exp(\u03b2 J sum) = 2 exp(3 \u03b2 J) + 6 exp(- \u03b2 J).\n\nWait, so Z = 2 e^{3\u03b2 J} +6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, exponents are wrong.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nOption C: Z=2e^{2J\u03b2} +6e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 Exponents are 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: Z=6e^{2J\u03b2} + 2e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 Also 2 in exponents, wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start with the given energy \\( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \\). The partition function is defined as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} \\exp(-\\beta E),\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\). Since \\( E = -J \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\), we have \\( -\\beta E = \\beta J \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\). Thus, the contribution of each state to \\( Z \\) depends on the value of \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\).\n\n### Step 1: Possible values of \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\)\nEach term \\( S_iS_j \\) can be \\( +1 \\) (if \\( S_i = S_j \\)) or \\( -1 \\) (if \\( S_i \\neq S_j \\)). The sum \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\) can therefore take the following values:\n- \\( +3 \\): All three spins are the same (\\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \\)).\n- \\( -1 \\): Exactly two spins are the same, and the third is different.\n\n### Step 2: Number of states for each value of \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j \\)\n- For \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j = +3 \\): There are 2 states: \\( (+1, +1, +1) \\) and \\( (-1, -1, -1) \\).\n- For \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j = -1 \\): There are 6 states, corresponding to all other configurations where two spins are the same, and one is different.\n\n### Step 3: Contribution of each state to \\( Z \\)\nFor each state, the contribution to \\( Z \\) is \\( \\exp(\\beta J \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j) \\). Thus:\n- For \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j = +3 \\): Contribution is \\( 2 \\exp(3\\beta J) \\).\n- For \\( \\sum_{i<j} S_iS_j = -1 \\): Contribution is \\( 6 \\exp(-\\beta J) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Total partition function\nAdding these contributions, the partition function is:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 \\exp(3\\beta J) + 6 \\exp(-\\beta J).\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Matching with the options\nComparing this result with the given options:\n- **Option A**: \\( Z = 2 \\exp(-3J\\beta) + 6 \\exp(J\\beta) \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.\n- **Option B**: \\( Z = 2 \\exp(3J\\beta) + 6 \\exp(-J\\beta) \\) \u2014 Correct, matches the derived expression.\n- **Option C**: \\( Z = 2 \\exp(2J\\beta) + 6 \\exp(-2J\\beta) \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the exponents are \\( 2J\\beta \\), not \\( 3J\\beta \\) and \\( J\\beta \\).\n- **Option D**: \\( Z = 6 \\exp(2J\\beta) + 2 \\exp(-2J\\beta) \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the exponents are \\( 2J\\beta \\), and the coefficients are swapped.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
