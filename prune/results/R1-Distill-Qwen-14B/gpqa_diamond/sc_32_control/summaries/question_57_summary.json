      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering with electrons at 50 MeV. The question gives me some phase shifts and wants me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes, especially in partial wave expansions.\n\nWait, the phase shifts given are \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, and \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0. And I'm supposed to ignore the rest. So I think those are the phase shifts for the s-wave (l=0), p-wave (l=1), d-wave (l=2), and so on up to l=4.\n\nI remember that the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) can be written as a sum over these partial waves. The formula is something like f(\u03b8) = (1/k) \u03a3 (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} sin(\u03b4_l) [some spherical harmonics terms], but wait, no, I think the general form is f(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) \u03a3 (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But maybe for this problem, we're considering the forward direction, so \u03b8=0\u00b0, which corresponds to cos\u03b8=1.\n\nWait, the question says along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, that's when \u03b8=0\u00b0, the forward direction. So in that case, the only term that contributes from the Legendre polynomials is when l=0 because P\u2080(1)=1, and all higher P_l(1) for l>0 are zero? Or wait, no\u2014P_0 is 1, P_1 is something else, but when x=1, P_l(1)=1 for all l? No, wait, no. Let me think. For the Legendre polynomials, P_l(1) is indeed 1 for all l because when x=1, each polynomial evaluates to 1. But wait, no, that can't be right. Because P_1(x) = x, so P_1(1)=1. P_2(x) = (3x\u00b2-1)/2, so P_2(1)= (3-1)/2 = 1. So all P_l(1) are 1? So for \u03b8=0\u00b0, cos\u03b8=1, each term contributes. Hmm, but that complicates things. Because then the sum would have all the terms.\n\nBut wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(\u03b8) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8). Or maybe I have the multiplicative factor wrong. Let me get this right. The general expression is:\n\nf(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8)\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: I think the expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial waves is:\n\nf(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\u221e sum_{m=-l}^l (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} (sin\u03b4_l) [something involving spherical harmonics?]\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (\u03b8=0) would relate to the total cross-section. Because the differential cross-section is |f(\u03b8)|^2, and when \u03b8=0, the forward direction, but maybe for the imaginary part, it's linked to the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section \u03c3_total is (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) * Im(f(0)), where f(0) is the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0. So if I can find Im(f(0)), that would relate to the total cross-section.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section. So perhaps I can express Im(f(0)) in terms of the given phase shifts.\n\nLet me get back to the formula for f(\u03b8). At \u03b8=0, cos\u03b8=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the sum becomes:\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1 ]\n\nBecause each term in the sum is (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] multiplied by P_l(1) which is 1.\n\nSo f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nBecause the phase shifts beyond l=4 are ignored.\n\nWait, but wait, in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given up to \u03b4_4=13\u00b0, so I think l goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSo let's compute each term for l=0 to l=4.\n\nEach term is (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nBut let's compute the imaginary part of f(0). Because f(0) is a complex number, and we're to find its imaginary part.\n\nSo compute Im(f(0)) = Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] ]\n\nHmm, but 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), since 1/i = -i.\n\nSo f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nSo the imaginary part of f(0) would be the imaginary part of (-i/(2k)) times the sum.\n\nLet me factor out the constants. Let me write this as:\n\nIm(f(0)) = Im [ (-i/(2k)) * S ] \n\nwhere S is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2i \u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nBut S is a complex number. Let me expand it.\n\nSo S = sum [ (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} ] - sum [ (2l+1) ]\n\nBecause [ e^{2i\u03b4} -1 ] = e^{2i\u03b4} - 1.\n\nSo S = sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} - sum (2l+1) \n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nCompute sum (2l+1) from l=0 to 4. When l=0, 1; l=1,3; l=2,5; l=3,7; l=4,9. So sum is 1+3+5+7+9 = 25.\n\nNow, the other part is sum (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l}, each term is (2l+1) multiplied by e^{i 2 \u03b4_l }, but since \u03b4_l is in degrees, I need to convert them to radians for calculations.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute each term's imaginary part and then sum them, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part of the sum S.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The imaginary part of S is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term, because each term is a complex number.\n\nSo Im(S) = sum_{l=0}^4 Im[ (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} ] \n\nSince (2l+1) is real.\n\nIm[e^{i\u03b8}] = sin\u03b8, so e^{i2\u03b4_l} = cos(2\u03b4_l) + i sin(2 \u03b4_l )\n\nSo each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l )\n\nSo Im(S) = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l )\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Because S = sum (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} - sum (2l+1), so S = [sum (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} ] - [sum (2l+1) ]\n\nTherefore, Im(S) = Im( sum (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} ) - Im( sum (2l+1) )\n\nBut the sum (2l+1) is real, so its imaginary part is zero. Therefore, Im(S) = Im( sum (2l+1) e^{2i \u03b4_l} )\n\nWhich is sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l )\n\nSo Im(S) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l )\n\nNow, putting it all together. \n\nIm(f(0)) = Im [ (-i/(2k)) * S ]\n\n= Im [ (-i/(2k)) * (Re(S) + i Im(S)) ) ]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n= Im [ ( (-i Re(S) )/(2k) ) + ( (-i^2) Im(S) )/(2k) ) ]\n\nSince i^2 = -1,\n\n= Im [ ( -i Re(S) )/(2k) + ( Im(S) )/(2k) ) ]\n\nBecause the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, the term (Im(S)/(2k)) is real, so its imaginary part is zero. The other term is (-i Re(S))/(2k), which is purely imaginary.\n\nSo the imaginary part of [ (-i Re(S))/(2k) + Im(S)/(2k) ) ] is [ - Re(S)/(2k) ].\n\nWait, let me recheck: \n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n(-i/(2k)) * (Re(S) + i Im(S)) )\n\n= [ (-i Re(S) )/(2k) ) ] + [ (-i^2 Im(S) )/(2k) ) ]\n\n= [ (-i Re(S))/(2k) ) ] + [ (Im(S))/(2k) ) ]\n\nThe first term is imaginary, the second is real. So when taking the imaginary part of the whole expression, only the first term contributes.\n\nImaginary part of the expression is ( - Re(S) )/(2k )\n\nWait, because the first term is (-i Re(S))/(2k) which is equal to i * (-Re(S))/(2k). So the imaginary part is (-Re(S))/(2k).\n\nSo:\n\nIm(f(0)) = (- Re(S) )/(2k )\n\nBut wait, no, because in terms of components:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n[ (Re(S) + i Im(S)) * (-i) ] / (2k )\n\n= [ -i Re(S) - i^2 Im(S) ] / (2k )\n\n= [ -i Re(S) + Im(S) ] / (2k )\n\nBecause i squared is -1, so minus i squared is +1.\n\nSo the expression is (Im(S) + [ -i Re(S) ]) / (2k )\n\nSo the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is (- Re(S))/(2k )\n\nSo Im(f(0)) = (- Re(S) )/(2k )\n\nWait, but let's think about this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the signs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute f(0) in terms of real and imaginary parts, then take the imaginary part.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to compute each term in S, then compute S, then compute Im(f(0)).\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute S as the sum of (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 )\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFor each l, compute (2l+1) ( e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1 )\n\nThen sum all these terms, then multiply by (-i)/(2k), then take the imaginary part.\n\nBut let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWe have \u03b4_0=90\u00b0, \u03b4_1=67\u00b0, \u03b4_2=55\u00b0, \u03b4_3=30\u00b0, \u03b4_4=13\u00b0.\n\nCompute each (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4} - 1 ]\n\nConvert each \u03b4 to radians for calculation.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nl | 2l+1 | \u03b4 (degrees) | 2\u03b4 (degrees) | e^{2i \u03b4} | e^{2i \u03b4} -1 | (2l+1)(e^{2i \u03b4} -1)\n\n0 | 1 | 90 | 180 | e^{i \u03c0} = -1 | (-1) -1 = -2 | 1*(-2) = -2\n\n1 |3 |67 | 134 degrees= 2.339 radians | e^{i * 2.339} \u2248 e^{i 134\u00b0} \u2248 cos(134\u00b0) + i sin(134\u00b0) \u2248 (-0.6947) + i (0.7193) | e^{i 134} -1 \u2248 (-0.6947-1) + i 0.7193 \u2248 (-1.6947) + i 0.7193 | 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.7193) \u2248 (-5.0841) + i 2.1579\n\n2 |5 |55 \u2192 110\u00b0 \u2192 1.91986 radians | e^{i 110\u00b0} \u2248 cos(110) + i sin(110) \u2248 (-0.3420) + i 0.9397 | e^{i 110} -1 \u2248 (-1.3420) + i 0.9397 | 5*(-1.3420 + i 0.9397) \u2248 (-6.71) + i 4.6985\n\n3 |7 |30 \u2192 60\u00b0 \u2192 1.0472 radians | e^{i 60} = 0.5 + i (\u221a3/2) \u2248 0.5 + i 0.8660 | e^{i60} -1 = (0.5-1) + i 0.8660 \u2248 (-0.5) + i 0.8660 | 7*(-0.5 + i 0.8660) \u2248 (-3.5) + i 6.062\n\n4 |9 |13 \u2192 26\u00b0 \u2192 0.4538 radians | e^{i26} \u2248 cos(26) + i sin(26) \u2248 0.8988 + i 0.4384 | e^{i26} -1 \u2248 (-0.1012) + i 0.4384 | 9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) \u2248 (-0.9108) + i 3.9456\n\nNow, sum each of the real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet me sum the real parts and the imaginary parts for each term.\n\nTerm l=0: real part = -2, imaginary part = 0.\n\nTerm l=1: real = -5.0841, imaginary = 2.1579.\n\nTerm l=2: real = -6.71, imaginary = 4.6985.\n\nTerm l=3: real = -3.5, imaginary = 6.062.\n\nTerm l=4: real = -0.9108, imaginary = 3.9456.\n\nNow, sum all the real parts:\n\n-2 + (-5.0841) = -7.0841\n\n-7.0841 + (-6.71) = -13.7941\n\n-13.7941 + (-3.5) = -17.2941\n\n-17.2941 + (-0.9108) = -18.2049\n\nSum of real parts: S_real = -18.2049.\n\nSum of imaginary parts:\n\n0 + 2.1579 = 2.1579\n\n+4.6985 \u2192 6.8564\n\n+6.062 \u2192 12.9184\n\n+3.9456 \u2192 16.8640\n\nSum_imag = 16.8640.\n\nSo S = S_real + i S_imag = (-18.2049) + i (16.8640 )\n\nNow, f(0) = [ (-i)/(2k) ] * S\n\nBut what is k?\n\nk is the wave number, which is equal to sqrt(2mE)/\u0127. But since we're dealing with electrons, and given that E is 50 MeV, but let's think in terms of units.\n\nWait, electrons have mass m_e. The Compton wavelength is approximately 2.426 fm. So the wave number k is 2\u03c0/(\u03bb), where \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute k in units where \u0127 = 1 and c=1, but perhaps I can compute it in terms of eV and meters.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since the problem gives options in units of fm, perhaps we can compute k in units of inverse fm.\n\nWait, but let's compute k.\n\nThe energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy of the electron is about 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than the rest mass, so non-relativistic approximations may not apply, but perhaps we can use relativistic expressions.\n\nThe relation between energy, momentum, and mass for a relativistic electron is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nSo p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c.\n\nBut in natural units where \u0127 = c =1, the wave number k is p.\n\nWait, but in terms of units:\n\nk = p / \u0127.\n\nWait, but in natural units, where \u0127 = c =1, then k = p.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute p in units of MeV/c.\n\nE =50 MeV. m c\u00b2= 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(2500 - 0.261) \u2248 sqrt(2499.739) \u2248 49.997 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224850 MeV/c.\n\nSo k = p / \u0127.\n\nBut \u0127 in units of MeV s is 6.582\u00d710^-25 MeV s.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse fm.\n\nWait, the wavelength \u03bb = 2\u03c0 /k.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: the momentum p for an electron with E=50 MeV is approximately 50 MeV/c.\n\nSo k = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (\u0127 c) ) * c.\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to use the formula k = (sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4)) / (\u0127 c) ) * c.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the Compton wavelength is \u03bb_c = 2.426 fm, and for an electron, the Compton wavelength is given by \u0127/(m_e c). So m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so \u0127 c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo, k = p / \u0127 = (E)/(\u0127 c) ), approximately, when E >> m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me compute p in terms of MeV/c.\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c. But since E is 50 MeV, and m c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV, so p \u2248 E/c = 50 MeV/c.\n\nSo k = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / (\u0127 c) ) * (c) )? Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:\n\nk = (p) / (\u0127) \n\nBut in units where \u0127 is in MeV s, and p is in MeV/c, then:\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1/fm.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the relation k = (2 E )^(1/2) / \u0127 c for high-energy electrons, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute k as follows:\n\nIn natural units (\u0127 = c =1 ), energy E has units of MeV, momentum p has units of MeV, and k = p.\n\nBut for an electron, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2.\n\nSo when E is 50 MeV, m is about 0.511 MeV, so p \u2248 E =50 MeV.\n\nSo k = p \u224850 MeV.\n\nBut to convert k into inverse fm, since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, and considering that in natural units (\u0127=c=1), 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.197 fm.\n\nWait, let me think again. In natural units, 1 GeV^-1 is 0.1973e-15 meters (since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). So 1 GeV^-1 is approximately 0.197 fm.\n\nSo 50 MeV = 0.05 GeV.\n\nSo 1/(0.05 GeV) = 20 GeV^-1 \u2248 20 * 0.197 fm \u2248 3.94 fm.\n\nSo k is about 50 MeV \u2192 0.05 GeV \u2192 k \u2248 20 GeV^-1 \u2192 3.94 fm^-1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because k is in 1/fm units. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute \u0127 c in MeV fm.\n\n\u0127 c \u2248 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo the momentum p in MeV/c is given by p = E\u00b2/(\u0127 c) ) when E >> m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, in high-energy limit, E \u2248 pc.\n\nSo p = E / c.\n\nBut in units where \u0127 c is in MeV fm, p is in MeV/c, and k = p / \u0127.\n\nSo k = (E / c) / \u0127 = E/(\u0127 c).\n\nBut \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo E is 50 MeV, so k = 50 / (197.33) \u2248 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSo k \u22480.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, because if E is 50 MeV, then p = E/(c) \u2192 50 MeV/c.\n\nThen, k = p/(\u0127) = (50 MeV/c) / (\u0127 c) * c ) \u2192 because \u0127 has units of J s = (MeV s) / c^2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula k = (p) / \u0127.\n\np is in MeV/c. \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo p = E / c \u2192 50 MeV/c.\n\nk = (50 MeV/c) / (\u0127 c) \u2192 since \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nBut wait, (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) \u2192 (1/c) / fm \u2192 1/(c fm) \u2192 but since c is in units of fm per second or something, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units of 1/fm:\n\nk = p / \u0127 = (E/(c)) / (\u0127)\n\nBut \u0127 is 197.33 MeV fm / c.\n\nSo p = E/(c) = 50 MeV/(c)\n\nk = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/(c)) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) \n\nThe MeV and c terms cancel out:\n\n= 50 / (197.33 fm) ) \u2192 approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo k \u2248 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.253) \u2248 1/0.506 \u2248 1.976 fm.\n\nSo now, Im(f(0)) is (\u2212 S_real) / (2k )\n\nS_real is \u221218.2049. So:\n\nIm(f(0)) = (- (-18.2049 )) / (2k ) = 18.2049 / (2k )\n\nSubstituting k =0.253 fm^{-1}:\n\nSo 2k = 0.506 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) = 18.2049 / 0.506 fm^{-1} \u2192 since 1/fm^{-1} is fm.\n\nWait, 18.2049 / (0.506) \u2248 35.98 fm.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) \u2248 35.98 fm.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, option C is 177.675, option D is 251.271, option A is 87163.4.\n\nWait, but wait, that's nowhere near any of the options. Did I make a mistake in calculations?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I'm getting k \u22480.253 fm^{-1}, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute k again.\n\nE =50 MeV.\n\nIn natural units, \u0127 c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit, k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127. But since E is much larger than the rest mass, perhaps the relativistic expression is better.\n\nBut for high-energy electrons, E \u2248 pc, so p = E/c.\n\nSo p =50 MeV/c.\n\nk = p / \u0127 = (50 MeV/c) / ( \u0127 )\n\nBut \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV fm, so \u0127 = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.\n\nSo k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / c ] ) \n\nThe c's cancel out.\n\nSo k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) \u2192 50/(197.33) \u2192 \u2248 0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 2k = 0.506 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) is 18.2049 / 0.506 \u2192 35.98 fm.\n\nBut none of the options are around 36 fm. The options are:\n\nA) 87163.4 fm\n\nB) 355.351 fm\n\nC) 177.675 fm\n\nD) 251.271 fm\n\nHmm, 35.98 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign when computing Im(f(0)).\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I thought that Im(f(0)) = ( - Re(S) )/(2k )\n\nRe(S) is -18.2049.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) = (- (-18.2049)) / (2k ) \u2192 18.2049/(2k )\n\nWhich is 18.2049/(0.506) \u224835.98 fm.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another approach: The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is (4\u03c0/k\u00b2) Im(f(0)).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which relates to the cross-section, but maybe in any case, let me check whether the cross-section approach can help.\n\nWait, let me compute the sum S again.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I think I made a mistake in the term for l=4.\n\nWait, let me recompute each term in the sum.\n\nFor l=0: \n\n(2l+1)=1. delta_0=90\u00b0, so 2delta_0=180\u00b0.\n\ne^{i 180} = -1.\n\nSo e^{2i delta_0} -1 = (-1) -1 = -2.\n\nSo term is 1 * (-2) = -2.\n\nl=0: real part = -2, imaginary part =0.\n\nl=1: delta=67\u00b0, so 2\u03b4=134\u00b0, which is 2.339 radians.\n\nCompute e^{i 134\u00b0}:\n\ncos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)\u2248-0.6947.\n\nsin(134)=sin(46)\u22480.7193.\n\nSo e^{i134} \u2248 (-0.6947) + i 0.7193.\n\nSo e^{i134} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i 0.7193 \u2192 (-1.6947) +i 0.7193.\n\nMultiply by (2l+1)=3:\n\n3*(-1.6947) = -5.0841 \u2192 real part.\n\n3*(0.7193) = 2.1579 \u2192 imaginary part.\n\nSo term l=1: real=-5.0841, imag=2.1579.\n\nl=2: delta=55\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b4=110\u00b0.\n\ncos(110)= -0.3420, sin(110)=0.9397.\n\ne^{i110} = cos(110)+i sin(110) = (-0.3420) + i 0.9397.\n\ne^{i110} -1 = (-0.3420 -1) +i 0.9397 = (-1.3420) +i 0.9397.\n\nMultiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420)= -6.710; 5*(0.9397)=4.6985.\n\nSo real: -6.710, imag:4.6985.\n\nl=3: delta=30\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b4=60\u00b0.\n\ne^{i60}=0.5 +i 0.8660.\n\ne^{i60} -1 = (0.5-1) +i 0.8660 \u2192 (-0.5) +i 0.8660.\n\nMultiply by7: 7*(-0.5)= -3.5; 7*(0.8660)=6.062.\n\nReal: -3.5, imag:6.062.\n\nl=4: delta=13\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b4=26\u00b0.\n\ncos(26)=0.8988, sin(26)=0.4384.\n\ne^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.\n\ne^{i26} -1 = (0.8988-1) +i 0.4384 \u2192 (-0.1012) +i 0.4384.\n\nMultiply by9: 9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108; 9*0.4384=3.9456.\n\nReal: -0.9108, imag:3.9456.\n\nAdding up all real parts:\n\n-2 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108 = ?\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n-2 + (-5.0841) = -7.0841.\n\n-7.0841 + (-6.71) = -13.7941.\n\n-13.7941 + (-3.5) = -17.2941.\n\n-17.2941 + (-0.9108) = -18.2049.\n\nImaginary parts:\n\n0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456.\n\n0 \u2192 2.1579 \u2192 6.8564 \u2192 +6.062 \u219212.9184 \u2192 +3.9456 \u219216.864.\n\nSo S_real = -18.2049, S_imag=16.864.\n\nThen f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * (S_real + i S_imag )\n\n= (-i/(2k)) [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n= (-i/(2k)) * (-18.2049) + (-i/(2k)) * i (16.864 )\n\n= [ (i * 18.2049 ) / (2k) ) ] + [ (i^2 * (-16.864) ) / (2k ) )\n\n= i*(18.2049)/(2k) + (-1) * (-16.864)/(2k )\n\nBecause i^2 = -1.\n\nSo:\n\n= i*(18.2049)/(2k) ) + (16.864)/(2k )\n\nSo f(0) is a complex number with real part 16.864/(2k) and imaginary part 18.2049/(2k).\n\nWait, that's a key point I think I messed up earlier.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and I should consider that the imaginary part of the amplitude is linked to the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, another approach: The imaginary part of the amplitude at \u03b8=0 is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that the imaginary part of the amplitude is sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l multiplied by 1/(2k).\n\nBut that's only when the phase shifts are small, perhaps, but in our case, \u03b4_0 is 90\u00b0, which is problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion, and compute the imaginary part as (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then:\n\nsum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l \u2192 l=0 to 4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nl=0: \u03b4=90\u00b0, sin(90)=1 \u2192 1 *1 =1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4=67 \u2192 sin(67)=0.9205 \u2192 3 *0.9205=2.7615.\n\nl=2: 55\u00b0, sin(55)=0.8192 \u21925 *0.8192=4.096.\n\nl=3:30\u00b0, sin(30)=0.5 \u21927 *0.5=3.5.\n\nl=4:13\u00b0, sin(13)=0.22495 \u21929 *0.22495\u22482.02455.\n\nSum these: 1 + 2.7615 =3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.\n\nThen Im(f(0)) would be (1/(2k)) * 13.382.\n\nWith k=0.253 fm^{-1}, 2k=0.506 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo 13.382 / 0.506 \u2192 26.44 fm.\n\nStill, not matching any options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Im( f(0) ) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nBut that approach gives 26.44 fm, which isn't an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the given options and think about possible factors I might have missed.\n\nWait, in the expression f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i \u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nThe imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) )/(2k )\n\nWait, earlier I thought that the Im(S) was sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me compute sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nl=0: 2\u03b4=180\u00b0 \u2192 sin(180)=0 \u2192 term=1 *0=0.\n\nl=1: 2\u03b4=134\u00b0 \u2192 sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193 \u2192 3 *0.7193\u22482.1579.\n\nl=2: 2\u03b4=110 \u2192 sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 \u21925 *0.9397\u22484.6985.\n\nl=3:60 \u2192 sin(60)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660 \u21927 *0.866\u22486.062.\n\nl=4:26\u00b0 \u2192 sin(26)=0.4384 \u21929 *0.4384\u22483.9456.\n\nSum these:\n\n0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )=16.864.\n\nThen Im(S)=16.864.\n\nThen S = Re(S) + i Im(S ), where Re(S)= sum (2l+1) [ cos(2\u03b4_l) -1 ] ?\n\nWait, let me compute Re(S):\n\nRe(S) = sum (2l+1) [ cos(2\u03b4_l) -1 ]\n\nl=0: cos(180)= -1 \u2192 1 * (-1 -1) = -2.\n\nl=1: cos(134)= -0.6947 \u21923 * (-0.6947-1) =3*(-1.6947)= -5.0841.\n\nl=2: cos(110)= -0.3420 \u21925*(-0.3420 -1)=5*(-1.342)= -6.710.\n\nl=3: cos(60)=0.5 \u21927*(0.5-1)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5.\n\nl=4: cos(26)=0.8988 \u21929*(0.8988-1)=9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.\n\nSum Re(S): -2 -5.0841= -7.0841 -6.710= -13.7941 -3.5= -17.2941 -0.9108= -18.2049.\n\nSo S= Re(S) + i Im(S ) \u2192 -18.2049 +i 16.864.\n\nThen f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * S.\n\nWhich is:\n\n= (-i/(2k)) * (-18.2049) + (-i/(2k)) * i 16.864.\n\n= i*(18.2049)/(2k) ) + (i^2 * (-16.864))/(2k )\n\n= i*(18.2049)/(2k) ) + (-16.864)/(2k )\n\nSo f(0) has real part (-16.864)/(2k ), and imaginary part (18.2049)/(2k )\n\nThus, Im(f(0)) = (18.2049 )/(2k ) \u2192 18.2049/(2 *0.253 ) \u224818.2049/0.506 \u224835.98 fm.\n\nAgain, about 36 fm, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Because sometimes the scattering amplitude is written differently.\n\nWait, another thought: The scattering amplitude f is often written as (1/k) sum ... but perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere.\n\nWait, the correct formula for f(\u03b8) is f(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, so for \u03b8=0, cos\u03b8=1, so each P_l(1)=1.\n\nThus, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nSo the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = Im [ (1/(2ik)) * S ]\n\nS is sum (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4} -1 )\n\nWhich, as before, when expanded, is S = sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4} - sum (2l+1) \n\nSo S = sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4} -25.\n\nWe calculated that sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4} = S +25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of S.\n\nWait, but S = sum (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 )\n\n= sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4} - sum (2l+1) \n\nSo the imaginary part of S is sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )\n\nWhich is 16.864 as before.\n\nSo f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * S.\n\nSo, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] (Re(S) + i Im(S) )\n\n= [ Re(S) + i Im(S) ] / (2ik )\n\n= [Re(S) + i Im(S) ] * (-i)/(2k )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= (-i Re(S) - i^2 Im(S) ) / (2k )\n\n= [ -i Re(S) + Im(S) ] / (2k )\n\nSo the real part of f(0) is Im(S)/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (-Re(S) )/(2k )\n\nSo, Im(f(0)) = (- Re(S) ) / (2k )\n\nRe(S) is -18.2049, so Im(f(0)) = (18.2049 )/(2k )\n\nWith k = 0.253 fm^{-1}, 2k =0.506 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=18.2049 / 0.506 \u2192 \u224835.98 fm.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have 36 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, another approach: The wavelength \u03bb is related to the energy E by the de Broglie relation.\n\n\u03bb = h / p, where h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum.\n\nIn units where \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0), so h = 2\u03c0 \u0127.\n\nSo p = sqrt( (2mE)^2 )/(2m), wait no, for relativistic particles:\n\nE = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )\n\nSo for E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.\n\nSo p c = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) \u2192 sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) \u224850 MeV.\n\nSo p =50 MeV/c.\n\nThen, \u03bb = h/(p) \u2192 h = 6.582\u00d710^{-25} MeV s.\n\nSo p =50 MeV/c \u2192 units: MeV/c.\n\nSo \u03bb = (6.582e-25 MeV s) / (50 MeV/c ) ) \u2192 (6.582e-25 /50 ) s c \u2192 (1.3164e-26 ) s c.\n\nBut c is in fm/s. Since 1 fm =1e-15 m, and the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo c =3e8 m/s = 3e8 /1e15 fm/s = 3e-7 fm/s.\n\nSo \u03bb = 1.3164e-26 s * 3e-7 fm/s \u2192 3.949e-33 fm.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because that's an incredibly small wavelength.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a unit conversion mistake.\n\nWait, let me recompute \u03bb.\n\np =50 MeV/c.\n\nh =6.582e-25 MeV s.\n\n\u03bb = h/(p) \u2192 (6.582e-25 MeV s) / (50 MeV/c ) ) \u2192 (6.582e-25 /50 ) (s * c) \u2192 1.3164e-26 s * c.\n\nConvert s * c to fm:\n\nc is 3e8 m/s \u2192 3e8 m/s = 3e8 * 1e15 fm / s \u2192 3e23 fm/s.\n\nSo \u03bb = 1.3164e-26 s * 3e23 fm/s \u2192 1.3164e-26 *3e23 = 3.9492e-3 fm \u2192 0.0039492 fm \u2192 approximately 3.949e-3 fm.\n\nWait, so \u03bb\u22480.003949 fm, so k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb \u2192 2\u03c0/(0.003949 fm ) \u2248 160 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, that's a big difference from earlier calculation. So maybe I messed up the calculation of k earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k correctly.\n\nk = p / \u0127 \u2192 but p is in MeV/c, \u0127 is in MeV s.\n\nWait, let me compute p in units of MeV/(c) \u2192 p=50 MeV/(c).\n\n\u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 MeV s.\n\nSo k = p / \u0127 \u2192 (50 MeV/c ) / (6.582e-25 MeV s ) \u2192 50/(6.582e-25) / c \u2192 ?\n\nBut wait, units don't seem to cancel correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute k in 1/fm.\n\nSince \u0127 c \u2248197.33 MeV fm.\n\nSo, p =50 MeV/c \u2192 so k = p/(\u0127 ) \u2192 (50 MeV/c ) / (\u0127 )\n\nBut \u0127 is 6.582e-25 MeV s.\n\nSo, (50 MeV/c ) / (6.582e-25 MeV s ) \u2192 50/(6.582e-25) 1/(c s )\n\nBut c is in fm/s \u2192 c =3e8 m/s =3e8 *1e15 fm/s / (1e15 m) \u2192 wait, no, to get c in fm/s:\n\n1 m = 1e15 fm \u2192 so c =3e8 m/s =3e8 *1e15 fm/s \u21923e23 fm/s.\n\nSo 1/(c s ) = 1/(3e23 fm/s * s ) \u2192 1/(3e23 fm ) \u2192 3.333e-24 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nk = (50 / 6.582e-25 ) * 3.333e-24 fm^{-1}\n\nWait, 50 /6.582e-25 \u2192 approx 7.59e25.\n\n7.59e25 *3.333e-24 \u2192 about 253. So k \u2248253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, that's a huge k. But earlier when I thought k was 0.253 fm^{-1}, that was a mistake because I used 50 MeV and forgot to account for the units correctly.\n\nSo, with k=253 fm^{-1}, let's recalculate Im(f(0)).\n\nIm(f(0)) = (18.2049 )/(2k ) \u2192 18.2049/(2*253) \u219218.2049/(506) \u22480.03598 fm.\n\nThat's about 0.036 fm, which is 36 femtometers? No, wait, 0.036 fm is 0.036 fm = 0.36 \u00d7 10^{-14} meters, which is 3.6 \u00d7 10^{-15} meters, but the options are in the hundreds of fm.\n\nHmm, something's not right here. I think I'm getting confused with the units, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nWait, let me use the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.\n\nIm(f(\u03b8=0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )\n\nWe computed sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )=16.864.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) = 16.864/(2k )\n\nBut if k=253 fm^{-1}, then 16.864/(2*253 )=16.864/506\u22480.0333 fm.\n\nBut the options are in the hundreds. So perhaps my calculation of k is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute k using the Compton wavelength.\n\nWait, the Compton wavelength of the electron is \u03bb_c = \u0127/(m_e c) \u2248 2.426 fm.\n\nSo for E=50 MeV, the wavelength \u03bb = h/(p) = (h c)/(p c ) \u2192 but perhaps it's better to compute using the relation:\n\nE = \u0127 \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 = E/\u0127.\n\nThe wave number k = \u03c9/c \u2192 E/(\u0127 c ) \u2192 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) \u2192 50/197.33 \u21920.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo k=0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*0.253 )=16.864/0.506\u224833.33 fm.\n\nWhich is about 33.3 fm, but the closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere in the units.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, 50 MeV \u2192 to get k in inverse fm, perhaps I should compute E in GeV.\n\nE=50 MeV =0.05 GeV.\n\nk = E / (\u0127 c ) \u2192 0.05 GeV / (0.1973 GeV fm ) \u2192 0.05 / 0.1973 \u22480.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. So Im(f(0))=16.864/(2 *0.253 )=33.33 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering that all the higher phase shifts beyond l=4 are included? But the question says to ignore the rest, so l=0 to 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, not 2\u03b4_l.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nsum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin90=1 \u21921.\n\nl=1:3 * sin67\u22483 *0.9205\u22482.7615.\n\nl=2:5* sin55\u22485 *0.8192\u22484.096.\n\nl=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.\n\nl=4:9 * sin13\u22489 *0.22495\u22482.02455.\n\nSum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.\n\nSo total sum=13.382.\n\nIm(f(0)) = (1/(2k )) * 13.382 \u219213.382/(2 *0.253 ) \u219213.382/0.506\u224826.44 fm.\n\nAgain, not matching any options.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, multiply by 2, and then divide by (2k ). So Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ] /k.\n\nWait, sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l=13.382.\n\nSo 13.382 /0.253 fm^{-1} \u2192\u224852.85 fm.\n\nStill not matching options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the real part of the amplitude. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the cross-section using the optical theorem and compare it with the options.\n\nThe optical theorem says:\n\n\u03c3_total = 4\u03c0/(k\u00b2) * Im(f(0)).\n\nSo, if Im(f(0)) is 35.98 fm, then \u03c3_total \u22484\u03c0/(k\u00b2) *35.98.\n\nk=0.253 fm^{-1} \u2192k\u00b2 \u22480.064 (fm^{-2} )\n\n4\u03c0 \u224812.566.\n\nSo \u03c3_total \u2248 12.566/(0.064 ) *35.98 \u219212.566/0.064\u2248196.34 \u2192 196.34 *35.98 \u22487060 fm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options for the amplitude are in fm, which doesn't directly relate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.\n\nWait, but where does that number come from?\n\nWait, perhaps when I computed Im(f(0))=35.98 fm, but if the actual correct calculation gives me half of that, perhaps 17.99 fm, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct formula is the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l multiplied by 1/k.\n\nIn that case, 13.382 /0.253 \u224852.85 fm.\n\nBut no option matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, and multiply by (1/k).\n\nSo 13.382/(0.253)\u224852.85 fm.\n\nBut again, no option matches.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing Im(f(0)).\n\nWait, earlier, I thought Im(f(0))= (18.2049 )/(2k ) \u2192 35.98 fm.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to compute Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(\u03b4_l )) /k \u219213.382/0.253=52.85 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have that either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the formula Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(\u03b4_l )) / (k).\n\nWhich would give 52.85 fm.\n\nBut options don't have that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(\u03b4_l )) * (k).\n\nWhich would be 13.382 *0.253\u22483.38 fm.\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(\u03b4_l ) * something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find an alternative approach.\n\nWait, the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The formula for f(\u03b8=0) is:\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nThe imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l ) ]/(2k )\n\nWhich we computed as 16.864/(2*0.253 )=33.33 fm.\n\nBut that's not an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each e^{2i\u03b4} correctly.\n\nWait, for l=0, \u03b4=90\u00b0, so 2\u03b4=180\u00b0, e^{i180}= -1 \u2192 real part -1, imaginary part 0.\n\nl=1: 67*2=134\u00b0, e^{i134}= cos(134)+i sin(134)= -0.6947 +i 0.7193.\n\nSo real part: -0.6947, imaginary 0.7193.\n\nSo e^{i134} -1= (-0.6947-1)+i 0.7193= -1.6947 +i 0.7193.\n\nMultiply by 3: real -5.0841, imaginary 2.1579.\n\nl=2: 55*2=110\u00b0, e^{i110}=cos(110)+i sin(110)= -0.3420 +i 0.9397.\n\ne^{i110}-1= (-1.3420)+i 0.9397.\n\nMultiply by5: real -6.710, imag 4.6985.\n\nl=3: 30*2=60\u00b0, e^{i60}=0.5 +i (\u221a3/2)=0.5 +i 0.8660.\n\ne^{i60}-1= (-0.5)+i 0.8660.\n\nMultiply by7: real -3.5, imag 6.062.\n\nl=4: 13*2=26\u00b0, e^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.\n\ne^{i26}-1= (-0.1012)+i 0.4384.\n\nMultiply by9: real -0.9108, imag 3.9456.\n\nSum real parts: -2 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108= -18.2049.\n\nSum imag parts: 0+2.1579+4.6985+6.062+3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo S=-18.2049 +i 16.864.\n\nThen f(0)= (-i/(2k)) * S \u2192 [(-i)(-18.2049 ) + (-i)(i 16.864 ) ]/(2k )\n\n= [i*18.2049 + (16.864 ) ]/(2k )\n\nSo real part is 16.864/(2k ), imag part is 18.2049/(2k ).\n\nSo Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(2*0.253 )=35.98 fm.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse fm correctly.\n\nGiven E=50 MeV, and m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.\n\nUsing E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \u2192 p c \u224850 MeV.\n\nSo p=50 MeV/c.\n\nk= p/(\u0127) \u219250 MeV/c / (\u0127 ).\n\nBut \u0127 c=197.33 MeV fm \u2192 \u0127=197.33 MeV fm /c.\n\nSo k= (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) \u219250/(197.33) fm^{-1} \u2192\u22480.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nThus, k=0.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=35.98 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, not 2\u03b4_l.\n\nIn that case, sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l=13.382.\n\nIm(f(0))=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(0.506 )=26.44 fm.\n\nAgain, not matching any options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum up to l=1 only, but the phase shifts given go up to l=4.\n\nWait, the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in including l=4.\n\nWait, the given phase shifts are delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, delta_4. So l runs from 0 to4.\n\nSo including all five terms is correct.\n\nI'm stuck. None of the approaches give an option that matches the given choices.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the question is using the formula where Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l multiplied by (1/k).\n\nSo 13.382/0.253 \u219252.85 fm.\n\nBut the options have option C as 177.675 fm, which is about three times that.\n\nWait, 52.85 *3=158.55, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2, getting 105.7 fm, which is close to option C (177), but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l )*(some factor).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * (k).\n\nSo 13.382 *0.253 \u22483.38 fm.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 10^(-15) meters (fm), but perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k, which I thought was 0.253 fm^{-1}, but perhaps it's 253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, how?\n\nIf E=50 MeV, then in terms of \u0127 c=197.33 MeV fm, then k = E/(\u0127 c )=50/197.33 \u21920.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nBut some sources might use k in 1/(fm) units, which would be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k using the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127.\n\nE=50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.\n\nBut that's the non-relativistic approach, which isn't valid here.\n\nBut for the sake of calculation, let's try it.\n\nk = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127.\n\nBut E in Joules: E=50 MeV =50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV \u21928.01e-12 J.\n\nm_e=9.11e-31 kg.\n\nSo 2mE= 2*9.11e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J \u2192 2*9.11e-31 *8.01e-12 \u2192approx1.458e-42 kg^2 m^2/s^2.\n\nsqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.458e-42 )=1.208e-21 m/s.\n\n\u0127=1.0545718e-34 J s.\n\nSo k=1.208e-21/(1.0545718e-34 ) \u2192\u22481.145e13 m^{-1}.\n\nConvert to 1/fm: 1 fm=1e-15 m \u21921/fm=1e15 m^{-1}.\n\nSo k=1.145e13 m^{-1} *1e15 m^{-1} /1 fm^{-1} \u21921.145e13 *1e15=1.145e28 fm^{-1}.\n\nThat can't be right. So the non-relativistic approach is not appropriate here.\n\nThus, I think the correct value of k is 0.253 fm^{-1}, leading to Im(f(0))=35.98 fm, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly half of 355.351 fm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me recheck the formula.\n\nThe formula for f(\u03b8) is f(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8 )\n\nAt \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1.\n\nSo f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nThe imaginary part is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l )) / (2k )\n\nWhich is 16.864/(2*0.253 ) \u224833.33 fm.\n\nBut that's not matching any option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l multiplied by 1/k.\n\nWhich would be (13.382 )/(0.253 )\u224852.85 fm.\n\nStill, no option matches.\n\nAnother thought: The phase shifts are given in degrees. Perhaps I should use radians in the calculations.\n\nWait, let's recompute sum(2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l ), but using radians.\n\nCompute each 2\u03b4 in radians:\n\nl=0: 180\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0 radians \u2192 sin(\u03c0)=0.\n\nl=1:134\u00b0 \u2192 2.339 radians \u2192 sin(2.339 )\u22480.7193.\n\nl=2:110\u00b0 \u21921.91986 radians \u2192 sin(1.91986 )\u22480.9397.\n\nl=3:60\u00b0 \u21921.0472 radians \u2192sin(1.0472 )=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660.\n\nl=4:26\u00b0 \u21920.4538 radians \u2192 sin(0.4538 )\u22480.4384.\n\nSo sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l ) is same as before: 16.864.\n\nThus, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, multiplied by 2 and by 1/k.\n\nWhich would be 2*13.382/0.253 \u219226.764/0.253\u2248105.75 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, the options are A:87163, B:355.351, C:177.675, D:251.271.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct Im(f(0)) is 355.351 fm, which is option B.\n\nHow could that be?\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 1000 in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, if k=253 fm^{-1}, then 18.2049/(2*253 )=0.03598 fm \u219235.98 fm.\n\nBut if k=0.253 fm^{-1}, then 18.2049/(2*0.253 )=35.98 fm.\n\nBut another possibility is that the phase shifts are in radians, but I used degrees. Wait, no, the phase shifts are given in degrees.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach gives Im(f(0))=35.98 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l / (2k )\n\nWhich would be13.382/(2 *0.253 )=26.44 fm.\n\nBut again, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C:177.675 fm.\n\nWhich is approximately 35.98 *5=179.9, which is close to 177.675.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the real parts.\n\nWait, let me recompute S_real.\n\nsum (2l+1) [ cos(2\u03b4_l ) -1 ]\n\nl=0: cos(180)= -1 \u21921*(-1-1)= -2.\n\nl=1: cos(134)= -0.6947 \u21923*(-0.6947-1 )=3*(-1.6947)= -5.0841.\n\nl=2: cos(110)= -0.3420 \u21925*(-0.3420 -1 )=5*(-1.342 )= -6.71.\n\nl=3: cos(60)=0.5 \u21927*(0.5-1 )=7*(-0.5 )= -3.5.\n\nl=4: cos(26)=0.8988 \u21929*(0.8988 -1 )=9*(-0.1012 )= -0.9108.\n\nSum: -2 -5.0841= -7.0841 -6.71= -13.7941 -3.5= -17.2941 -0.9108= -18.2049.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 355.351 fm, which is option B.\n\nBut I don't see how to get that number. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1/fm as 253 instead of 0.253.\n\nIf k=253 fm^{-1}, then Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2*253 )= 18.2049/506=0.03598 fm.\n\nWhich is 0.036 fm, but that's way smaller than any option.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 35.98 fm, which isn't among the options. However, option B is 355.351 fm, which is roughly 10 times larger. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, forgetting that 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately half of 355.351 fm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: the scattering amplitude f is given as f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8 )\n\nBut sometimes, the formula is written with a factor of 1/(2ik).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ] P_l(cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhich would change the calculation.\n\nIn that case, for \u03b8=0, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 ]\n\nSo Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l ) ]/(2k )\n\nWhich as before is 16.864/(2*0.253 )=33.33 fm.\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l and multiply by (k).\n\nWhich would be13.382 *0.253 \u22483.38 fm.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l and multiply by (k^2).\n\nBut I don't see how that would fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * (2k )\n\nWhich would be13.382 * (2*0.253 )=13.382 *0.506 \u2192\u22486.77 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is 10 times 35.535 fm.\n\nWait, 18.2049/(2k )=35.98 fm, which is approximately 36 fm. If k was 0.0253 fm^{-1}, then 18.2049/(2*0.0253 )= 358.7 fm, which is close to option B's 355.351 fm.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, and k is actually 0.0253 fm^{-1}.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k as 0.0253 fm^{-1}.\n\nWait, \u0127 c=197.33 MeV fm.\n\nE=50 MeV.\n\nk=E/(\u0127 c )=50/197.33 \u21920.253 fm^{-1}.\n\nSo no, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct k is 0.0253 fm^{-1}, which would give Im(f(0))=355 fm.\n\nBut then why would k be 0.0253 fm^{-1}?\n\nThat would require E= (k \u0127 c ) \u21920.0253 *197.33 \u21925.0 MeV.\n\nBut the problem states E=50 MeV.\n\nHmm, I'm at a loss. I think the correct answer based on the calculations is 35.98 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. But I can't see where the factor of 10 comes from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to give the real part, which would be 16.864/(2k )=16.864/(0.506 )=33.33 fm. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem used the sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l and multiplied by 1000, giving 13.382 *1000=13382 fm, but that's not an option either.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I'm forced to consider that the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\nOkay, so I've got this question about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nThe question gives me phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment with 50 MeV electrons. The phase shifts are \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, and \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0. I'm supposed to ignore the rest, so I guess higher order terms beyond \u03b4\u2084 don't matter here.\n\nThe task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8, \u03c6) has both real and imaginary parts, and when you're looking along the beam (\u03b8=0\u00b0), the expression might simplify a bit.\n\nWait, I think the general formula for the scattering amplitude involves a sum over all the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ (e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1) * (2l+1) * P_l(cos\u03b8) ) ] multiplied by a plane wave factor, but maybe for the imaginary part, some terms drop out.\n\nWait, but along the incident direction, \u03b8=0\u00b0, so cos\u03b8=1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1. So that simplifies the sum.\n\nAlso, I think the imaginary part of f is given by the imaginary part of each term in the sum. So for each l, the term (e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1) can be expanded. Let me think: e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8, so e^{2i\u03b4_l} = cos(2\u03b4_l) + i sin(2\u03b4_l). Therefore, e^{2i\u03b4_l} - 1 = [cos(2\u03b4_l) -1] + i sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nSo the imaginary part of each (e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1) is sin(2\u03b4_l). Therefore, the imaginary part of f should be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) * sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nWait, but what's k here? In scattering theory, k is the wave number, which is given by the square root of (2mE)/\u0127\u00b2. But wait, the energy here is given in MeV, so I might need to compute k in appropriate units.\n\nBut wait, the units of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude are in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters. So I'll probably need to compute k in units where these things work out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula that gives the imaginary part directly in terms of the phase shifts and the energy.\n\nWait, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l). And since we're along the beam direction, all the P_l terms are 1, so that's why it's the sum.\n\nSo let's write that out: Im(f) = [1/(2ik)] * [sum l=0 to 4 (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l)].\n\nWait, the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, right? So l=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, no, the phase shifts given are \u03b4\u2080, \u03b4\u2081, \u03b4\u2082, \u03b4\u2083, \u03b4\u2084, which correspond to l=0,1,2,3,4 respectively.\n\nSo let me compute the sum for each l:\n\nl=0: (2*0+1) sin(2*90\u00b0) = 1 * sin(180\u00b0) = 0.\n\nl=1: 3 * sin(2*67\u00b0) \u2192 3 * sin(134\u00b0). What's sin(134\u00b0)? 134 is in the second quadrant, so it's positive. sin(134)= sin(180\u221246)= sin46\u22480.7193. So 3*0.7193 \u2248 2.1579.\n\nl=2: 5 * sin(110\u00b0). 110 degrees: sin(110) is sin(180-70)=sin70\u22480.9397. So 5 * 0.9397\u22484.6985.\n\nl=3:7 * sin(60\u00b0). 60 degrees: sin60\u22480.8660. So 7 *0.866 \u22486.062.\n\nl=4:9 * sin(26\u00b0). 26 degrees: sin(26)\u22480.4384. 9 *0.4384\u22483.9456.\n\nAdding all these up: l=0 contributes 0, l=1: 2.1579, l=2:4.6985, l=3:6.062, l=4:3.9456.\n\nSum: 2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 16.864.\n\nThen Im(f)= [1/(2ik)] * 16.864.\n\nNow I need to compute k. The energy is 50 MeV. Let's recall that the relation between energy E and wave number k is E = (\u0127\u00b2k\u00b2)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.\n\nBut wait, I need to get k in units of 1/fm because the answer is in fm. Let me be careful with the units.\n\nFirst, I'll compute k using E=50 MeV.\n\nE = (\u0127\u00b2 k\u00b2)/(2m) \u2192 k = sqrt( (2mE)/(\u0127\u00b2) )\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, m is the electron mass. m \u2248 9.10938356 \u00d7 10^-31 kg.\n\n\u0127 is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nE is 50 MeV. Oh, right, I need to convert E into joules.\n\n1 eV = 1.60218 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nSo 50 MeV = 50 \u00d7 10^6 eV = 5e7 eV.\n\nSo E = 5e7 * 1.60218e-19 J = approximately 8.0109e-12 J.\n\nNow let's compute 2mE:\n\n2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J.\n\nWait, but J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2. So 2mE has units kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, no, 2mE is (kg) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2) \u2192 kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2. But when we take the square root in k, which is sqrt( kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2 * 1/ ( (J\u00b7s)^2 )) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute k in atomic units or use a known relation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for k in terms of energy in MeV.\n\nI remember that the Compton wavelength is related to the mass. The Compton wavelength \u03bb_c = \u0127/(m c). Wait, but perhaps for electrons, there's a way to compute k from E in MeV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for k in terms of E (in MeV) and the mass of the electron.\n\nElectron rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV. Since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.5 MeV, we can use the non-relativistic approximation for k.\n\nIn non-relativistic case, E = (\u0127\u00b2 k\u00b2) / (2 m). So k = sqrt(2 m E) / \u0127.\n\nSo compute k in meters:\n\nk = sqrt(2 m E) / \u0127.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm = 9.10938356e-31 kg.\n\nE = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 8.0109e-12 J.\n\nSo 2 m E = 2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J.\n\nWait, 2mE = 2 * 9.10938356e-31 * 8.0109e-12.\n\nLet me compute that: 9.10938e-31 * 8.0109e-12 = approx 7.302e-42. Multiply by 2: 1.4604e-41.\n\nThen sqrt(1.4604e-41) \u2192 sqrt(1.4604) is about 1.208e-20.5. Wait, sqrt(1e-42) is 1e-21, so sqrt(1.46e-41)= approx 1.208e-20.5? Hmm, wait, 1e-42 is (1e-21)^2, so 1.46e-41 is 1.46 * 1e-41 \u2192 sqrt(1.46e-41) = sqrt(1.46) * 1e-20.5 \u2192 which is about 1.208 * 3.16e-21? Wait, wait, 1e-20.5 is 1e-20 * 1e-0.5 \u2192 3.16e-21.\n\nSo 1.208 * 3.16e-21 \u2248 3.82e-21.\n\nThen k = (3.82e-21 m) / (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) \u2192 because \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34.\n\nWait, no: the formula is k = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127.\n\nWait, sqrt(2mE) is (2mE)^(1/2) \u2192 which is in units of sqrt(kg * J), but J is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so sqrt(kg * kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2 ) = kg^(3/2) m / s^(1/2).\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think in terms of units:\n\nE in joules is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nSo 2mE has units kg * kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2 = kg\u00b2 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nTaking the square root gives kg m/s.\n\nDivide by \u0127, which is J s = kg m\u00b2/s.\n\nSo sqrt(2mE) has units kg m/s.\n\nDivide by \u0127 (kg m\u00b2/s) \u2192 (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) ) = 1/m.\n\nSo k is 1/m, which is correct because wave number is in reciprocal meters.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\nsqrt(2mE) = sqrt( 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-12 J ) \u2192 compute this value.\n\nWait, 2 * 9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30 kg.\n\nMultiply by 8.0109e-12 J \u2192 1.821876e-30 * 8.0109e-12 = 1.4604e-41 kg\u00b7J.\n\nWait, kg\u00b7J is kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2. Taking the square root gives kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nSo sqrt(1.4604e-41 kg\u00b2 m\u00b2/s\u00b2) \u2192 1.208e-20.5 kg m/s.\n\nWait, 1e-41 is (1e-20.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-41) is 1e-20.5.\n\nSo approx 1.208e-20.5 kg m/s.\n\nThen divide by \u0127: 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, J\u00b7s is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s.\n\nSo (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) ) = (kg m/s) * (s)/(kg m\u00b2) )= 1/(m).\n\nSo let's compute the numerical value:\n\n1.208e-20.5 kg m/s divided by 1.0545718e-34 kg m\u00b2/s.\n\nWhich is (1.208e-20.5) / (1.0545718e-34) ) * (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) )\n\nSimplify the units: (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) ) = 1/(m).\n\nSo the numerical value is (1.208e-20.5) / (1.0545718e-34) )\n\nWait, let me compute the exponent:\n\n-20.5 is -20.5, so 1e-20.5 is about 3.16e-21.\n\nSo 1.208 *3.16e-21 \u2248 3.815e-21.\n\nSo 3.815e-21 divided by 1.0545718e-34 is approximately 3.617e13.\n\nWait, 3.815e-21 / 1.05e-34 \u2248 (3.815 / 1.05) ) * 1e13 \u2248 3.633 * 1e13 \u2192 3.633e13 1/m.\n\nSo k \u2248 3.633e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I did the exponents right.\n\nWait, sqrt(2mE) is sqrt(1.4604e-41) \u2192 sqrt(1.4604) is about 1.208, and sqrt(1e-41) is 1e-20.5 = 3.16e-21.\n\nSo 1.208 *3.16e-21 = 3.815e-21.\n\nDivide by \u0127 (1.0545718e-34):\n\n3.815e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 \u2248 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo k \u2248 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, since the answer is in fm, which is 1e-15 meters, let's convert k to 1/fm units.\n\n1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1/fm is 1e-15 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9 is 3.617e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 3.617e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 approximately 0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but wait, 3.617e13 m^-1 * (1 fm = 1e-15 m) \u2192 1 m = 1e15 fm \u2192 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.\n\nSo 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 3.617e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 3.617e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo k \u2248 0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that seems a bit small, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, Im(f) = [1/(2ik)] * sum.\n\nSum we found was approximately 16.864.\n\nSo 1/(2i * k) \u2192 1/(2i * 0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 1/(0.07234 i fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 since 1/(fm\u207b\u00b9) is fm.\n\nSo 1/(0.07234 i) fm.\n\nWait, 1/(0.07234) is about 13.82.\n\nSo 13.82 / i \u2192 which is -13.82i, because 1/i = -i.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) \u2192 which is (1/(2i)) * (0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9)^-1 ) \u2192 1/(2i) * (1/(0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9)) ) \u2192 1/(2i) * (27.66 fm) \u2192 [27.66/(2i)] fm \u2192 13.83 / i fm.\n\nSo 13.83 / i is -13.83i.\n\nSo Im(f) = (sum) * [1/(2ik)] \u2192 sum is 16.864.\n\nSo Im(f) = 16.864 * (-13.83i) * fm.\n\nWait, wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, Im(f) is [1/(2ik)] * sum.\n\nsum is 16.864.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) is 1/(2i * 0.03617 fm\u207b\u00b9) ) \u2192 1/(0.07234 i fm\u207b\u00b9) ) \u2192 which is (1/0.07234) * (1/fm\u207b\u00b9) ) * (1/i) \u2192 (13.82) * fm * (-i), because 1/i = -i.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = -13.82 fm.\n\nSo Im(f) = sum * (1/(2ik)) = 16.864 * (-13.82 fm) \u2192 16.864 * (-13.82) \u2248 -232.5 fm.\n\nWait, but wait, the imaginary part is a magnitude, but I'm getting a negative value. However, in scattering theory, the imaginary part of the amplitude is related to the inelastic contribution, but the sign might not matter here for the magnitude. Wait, but the options are all positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when dealing with 1/i.\n\nWait, 1/(2ik) \u2192 let's compute that again.\n\nk is positive, so 2ik is 2i *k, a purely imaginary number. So 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).\n\nSo when I multiply by the sum (which is real, 16.864), the result is (16.864) * (-i/(2k)).\n\nSo Im(f) is the imaginary part of f, which would be the coefficient of i. So Im(f) = (16.864) * (-1/(2k)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The formula for Im(f) is the imaginary part of [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ... ]\n\nSo f = real part + i * imaginary part.\n\nSo let me write it as [ sum ] * (1/(2ik)).\n\n1/(2ik) = [1/(2i)] * (1/k) = ( -i/(2) ) * (1/k).\n\nSo [ sum ] * ( -i/(2k) ) \u2192 which is [ sum * (-i) ] / (2k).\n\nSo f = [ sum * (-i) ] / (2k ) \u2192 which is 0 + i * [ -sum/(2k) ].\n\nWait, no, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. So the imaginary part is [ - sum/(2k ) ].\n\nWait, no, f = [ sum ] * (1/(2ik)).\n\n1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.\n\nSo f = [ sum ] * (-i/(2k) ) \u2192 which is 0 - i [ sum/(2k) ].\n\nSo the imaginary part of f is - sum/(2k).\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the imaginary part, which is a real number. So the negative sign would indicate the phase, but the magnitude is positive. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, but the options are positive, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation of k.\n\nWait, when I calculated k, I found 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9, which converted to fm\u207b\u00b9 is 3.617e13 * (1e-15 m)\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 3.617e13 * 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 3.617e28 fm\u207b\u00b9? That can't be right. Wait, no, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let's clarify the units.\n\n1 m = 1e15 fm.\n\nSo 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo when I have k in m\u207b\u00b9, to convert to fm\u207b\u00b9, it's multiplied by 1e15.\n\nWait, if k is 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9, then in fm\u207b\u00b9, it's 3.617e13 * 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 3.617e28 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that's an enormous number, and when I use it in the formula, it would give a tiny result, but the options are in the hundreds of fm.\n\nI think I must have made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's compute k in units of 1/fm.\n\nLet me compute k in terms of MeV/c.\n\nWait, another approach: the relation between energy and wave number. Perhaps using natural units where \u0127 = c =1.\n\nIn natural units, E (in MeV) is equal to (\u0127 c k), but I'm not sure about the exact relation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127, but in units where E is in MeV, m is the electron mass in MeV/c\u00b2, and \u0127 is in MeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in units where c=1 and \u0127=1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the standard formula for the electron's wave number in terms of its energy.\n\nI think for an electron, the wave number k can be approximated as k \u2248 sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127), but when E is much larger than the rest mass energy (which is 0.511 MeV), the non-relativistic approximation is okay.\n\nWait, let me compute the mass of the electron in energy terms. m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, E = 50 MeV, which is much larger than 0.511 MeV, so the non-relativistic approximation should be okay.\n\nSo, using E = (\u0127\u00b2 k\u00b2)/(2m), I can solve for k:\n\nk = sqrt( (2mE) ) / \u0127.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the units are consistent.\n\nIf I take m in MeV/c\u00b2, E in MeV, and \u0127 in MeV\u00b7s, but perhaps it's easier to find a formula that gives k in terms of E in MeV.\n\nWait, I found a formula online once that for electrons, k (in inverse femtometers) can be approximated as:\n\nk (fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2248 0.62 (E (MeV))^(1/2) / (1 + 0.035 (E (MeV))^(1/4)) )\n\nBut I'm not sure about this; perhaps I should compute it directly.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength \u03bb_c = \u0127/(m_e c).\n\nBut I'm not sure that helps here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the following approach:\n\nExpress E in eV, m in kg, and compute k in m\u207b\u00b9, then convert to fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, let's try again with E = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-12 J.\n\nm = 9.109e-31 kg.\n\nCompute 2mE: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-12 J.\n\nWait, 2mE = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-12 = 1.46e-41 kg\u00b7J.\n\nWait, J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so 2mE has units kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(2mE) has units kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nThen k = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127.\n\nCompute sqrt(2mE):\n\nsqrt(1.46e-41 kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2) = 1.208e-20.5 kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nWait, 1e-41 is (1e-20.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-41) is 1e-20.5.\n\nSo sqrt(1.46e-41) \u2248 1.208e-20.5 kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nThen \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s.\n\nSo k = (1.208e-20.5 kg\u00b7m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s).\n\nSimplify the units: kg\u00b7m/s divided by kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s \u2192 (kg\u00b7m/s) * (s)/(kg\u00b7m\u00b2) ) \u2192 1/(m).\n\nSo the numerical value is (1.208e-20.5) / (1.0545718e-34) ) \u2192 1.208e-20.5 / 1.05457e-34 \u2248 (1.208/1.05457) ) * 1e13.5 \u2192 approx 1.145 * 3.16e13 \u2192 3.62e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, 1e-20.5 is 3.16e-21, so 1.208e-20.5 is 3.81e-21.\n\n3.81e-21 / 1.05457e-34 \u2248 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo k = 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, converting m\u207b\u00b9 to fm\u207b\u00b9:\n\n1 m = 1e15 fm \u2192 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 3.61e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 3.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 0.0361 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 0.0361 fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 1/(0.0722 i fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 which is (1/0.0722) * (1/fm\u207b\u00b9) * (1/i)\n\n(1/fm\u207b\u00b9) is fm, so 1/(0.0722 i) fm \u2192 13.85 * (1/i) fm \u2192 13.85 * (-i) fm.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = -13.85 i fm.\n\nSo Im(f) = sum * [1/(2ik)].\n\nsum is 16.864.\n\nSo Im(f) = 16.864 * (-13.85 i) fm \u2192 which is -232.5 i fm.\n\nBut the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, so Im(f) = -232.5 fm.\n\nWait, but the options are all positive. Did I make a mistake in the sign?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value because the phase shift is about the magnitude. But looking at the phase shifts given, some are greater than 90 degrees, so the sine might be positive or negative.\n\nWait, wait, when I computed the sum, I had sum = 16.864. Let me double-check the individual terms.\n\nl=0: 1 * sin(180) = 0.\n\nl=1: 3 * sin(134\u00b0) \u2192 3 * 0.6691 \u2248 2.0073 (Wait, earlier I thought it was 0.7193, but wait, sin(134) is sin(180\u221246)= sin46\u22480.7193).\n\nOh wait, sin(134 degrees)= sin(46 degrees)= approximately 0.7193.\n\nSo 3 * 0.7193 = 2.1579.\n\nl=2: 5 * sin(110). 110 degrees \u2192 sin(70) \u2248 0.9397 \u2192 5 * 0.9397=4.6985.\n\nl=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(sqrt(3)/2)=7*0.8660=6.062.\n\nl=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.\n\nSum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 \u2192 +6.062=12.9184 \u2192 +3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo sum is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the negative sign is correct, but the options don't have negative values. Hmm.\n\nWait, but when I calculate Im(f), the result is -232.5 fm, but the options are 87163, 355, 177, 251. So none match approximately 232.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, let me compute k again.\n\nk = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127.\n\nE=50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-12 J.\n\nsqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J ) \u2192 sqrt(1.46e-41 kg^2\u00b7m^2/s^2).\n\nWhich is 1.208e-20.5 kg\u00b7m/s \u2192 1.208e-20.5 \u2248 3.81e-21.\n\nDivide by \u0127=1.05457e-34 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s: 3.81e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nAh, but wait, 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9 is 3.61e13 (1/m).\n\nSo 1/m is 1e15 fm/m \u2192 because 1 m = 1e15 fm.\n\nWait, no, 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = (1e15 fm)\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 3.61e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 3.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 0.0361 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) \u2192 1/(2i * 0.0361 fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 1/(0.0722 i fm\u207b\u00b9 )\n\nWhich is (1/0.0722) * (1/(i) ) * fm \u2192 Approximately 13.85 * (1/i) fm \u2192 13.85 * (-i) fm.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = -13.85 i fm.\n\nIm(f) = sum * [1/(2ik) ] \u2192 16.864 * (-13.85 i) fm \u2192 which gives Im(f) = -232.5 fm.\n\nBut since the options are all positive, perhaps the correct answer is the magnitude, 232.5 fm, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the options are A) 87163, B) 355, C)177, D)251.27.\n\nHmm, 232 is not close to any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps when I calculate the imaginary part, I should have it as (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l), but perhaps I forgot a factor.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the Born approximation.\n\nWait, in the case of the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part at \u03b8=0 is given by Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nBut in some references, the formula might include a factor of 4\u03c0 or something else. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8,\u03c6)= (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} (P_l(cos\u03b8)).\n\nThen, the imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) P_l(cos\u03b8).\n\nAt \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nSo my approach seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a more straightforward way to compute k. Let me compute it in atomic units.\n\nWait, another approach: The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127), as before.\n\nBut perhaps using the value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s and m in eV/c\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute E in eV: 50 MeV = 5e7 eV.\n\nThe mass of the electron m_e is approximately 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 = 5.11e5 eV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, E = 5e7 eV.\n\nSo, 2mE = 2 * (5.11e5 eV/c\u00b2) * (5e7 eV) ) \u2192 2 *5.11e5 *5e7 = 2 *5.11e12 = 1.022e13 eV\u00b2 /c\u00b2.\n\nBut I need to find k in 1/fm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units of inverse femtometers.\n\nLet me use the formula:\n\nk (fm\u207b\u00b9) = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127, where m is in MeV/c\u00b2, E in MeV, and \u0127 in MeV s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Planck's constant \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s \u2192 which is 6.582e-25 MeV\u00b7s * 1000 = 6.582e-22 MeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me compute k in terms of E in MeV and m in MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nThe formula is k = sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127 c).\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct formula in these units is k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127, but with c=1 in these units.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relation:\n\nk (fm\u207b\u00b9) = sqrt( 2 m (E) ) / \u0127,\n\nwhere m is in MeV/c\u00b2, E is in MeV, and \u0127 is in MeV s.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, I can find a standard value or use a known relation.\n\nWait, I found a reference that says that for electrons, the wave number k can be expressed as:\n\nk \u2248 0.62 * sqrt(E) / (1 + 0.035 * (E)^{1/4} )\n\nwhere E is in MeV, and k is in fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nIf E is 50 MeV, then:\n\nk \u2248 0.62 * sqrt(50) / (1 + 0.035*(50)^{1/4} )\n\nCompute sqrt(50) \u2248 7.071.\n\n50^{1/4} is the fourth root of 50. Let's compute that: the square root of sqrt(50) \u2248 sqrt(7.071) \u2248 2.658.\n\nSo denominator: 1 + 0.035 * 2.658 \u2248 1 + 0.093 \u2248 1.093.\n\nSo k \u2248 0.62 * 7.071 / 1.093 \u2248 (4.37) / 1.093 \u2248 4.0.\n\nSo k \u2248 4.0 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's a much more manageable number. So maybe earlier calculations were way off because of unit conversion mistakes.\n\nSo with k \u2248 4 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, compute Im(f) = [1/(2ik)] * sum.\n\nsum is 16.864.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i *4) )= 1/(8i) \u2192 which is -i/8.\n\nSo Im(f) = 16.864 * (-i/8 ) fm.\n\nSo the imaginary part is (16.864 / 8 ) * (-i) fm \u2192 2.108 * (-i) fm.\n\nBut the imaginary part is the real coefficient of i, so Im(f) would be -2.108 fm.\n\nBut this is nowhere near the options given, which are in the hundreds or tens of thousands of fm. So this suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to consider the fact that the scattering amplitude is in units of fm, and the imaginary part is the imaginary component.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts includes a factor of 4\u03c0 or something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) / (2k).\n\nBecause in the expression, 1/(2ik) times the sum, but when you take the imaginary part, you might have Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) / (2k).\n\nWait, no, let's recompute.\n\nSo f = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l}.\n\nThe imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nSo, since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), the imaginary part of f is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) ] * ( -i/(2k) ) \u2192 which as a real number is [ sum ... ] * ( -1/(2k) )\n\nBut since the imaginary part is a real number, Im(f) = - sum/(2k).\n\nWait, but the negative sign suggests it's negative, but the options are positive. So perhaps I should take the magnitude.\n\nBut in any case, let me compute Im(f) = sum/(2k) \u2192 since the negative could be due to the phase.\n\nWait, so with k \u22484 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nsum is 16.864.\n\nSo Im(f) = (16.864) / (2*4) ) \u2192 16.864 /8 \u2192 2.108 fm.\n\nBut options are much larger. So perhaps my calculation of k is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula uses k in units of inverse angstroms or another unit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use k in units of 1e-15 m (fm\u207b\u00b9) as per the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the initial approach but recompute k accurately.\n\nLet me compute k using the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/\u0127.\n\nE=50 MeV = 50e6 eV.\n\nm=9.10938e-31 kg.\n\nE in joules: 50e6 * 1.602e-19 =8.01e-12 J.\n\nCompute 2mE: 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01e-12 = 1.46e-41 kg\u00b2 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nsqrt(2mE)= sqrt(1.46e-41) =1.208e-20.5 kg m/s.\n\nBut wait, kg\u00b7m/s is the unit of momentum.\n\nThen k = (1.208e-20.5 kg m/s) / (1.05457e-34 kg m\u00b2/s).\n\nSimplify units: (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) )= 1/m.\n\nSo, the numerical value is 1.208e-20.5 /1.05457e-34.\n\nCompute 1.208e-20.5 / 1.05457e-34 \u2192 1.208/1.05457 \u22481.145.\n\nAnd 1e-20.5 / 1e-34 = 1e13.5 \u2192 3.16e13.\n\nSo 1.145 *3.16e13 \u2192 3.62e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nConvert to fm\u207b\u00b9: 3.62e13 m\u207b\u00b9 * (1e15 fm/m) \u2192 3.62e28 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's way too big. So 1/k is 1/(3.62e28 fm\u207b\u00b9) \u2192 2.76e-29 fm.\n\nSo 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i *3.62e28) ) fm \u2192 but this gives a very small number, which doesn\u2019t match the options.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to find an alternative approach or check if I'm using the correct formula.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the imaginary part is given by (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l)) / (2k), and perhaps k is in the same units as the options.\n\nWait, if the sum is 16.864 and k is in fm\u207b\u00b9, then Im(f) would be in fm.\n\nBut with k=3.62e13 m\u207b\u00b9 =3.62e13 * (1e15 fm)^-1 \u2192 3.62e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 16.864/(2*3.62e-2) \u2192 16.864/(0.0724) \u2192 approx 232.9 fm.\n\nWhich is about 233 fm. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, the options are A) 87163 fm, B)355, C)177, D)251.271.\n\n233 is close to option D (251.271), but not exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in summing the terms.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sum:\n\nl=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.\n\nl=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(46)=3*(0.7193)=2.1579.\n\nl=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * sin(70)=5*(0.9397)=4.6985.\n\nl=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(0.8660)=6.062.\n\nl=4:9 * sin(26)=9*(0.4384)=3.9456.\n\nSum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579; +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo sum is correct.\n\nIf I compute Im(f) = sum/(2k), and k=3.62e13 m\u207b\u00b9=3.62e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo Im(f)=16.864/(2 *3.62e-2) \u2192 16.864/(0.0724)= approx 232.9 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another consideration: The question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond \u03b44. So l goes from 0 to 4.\n\nWait, but what if the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) P_l(cos\u03b8), and along \u03b8=0, this is sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) / (2ik).\n\nBut if k is 3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9, which is 3.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9, then 1/(2ik) would be 1/(2i *3.61e-2) ) \u2192 (1/(0.0722i)) fm.\n\nWhich is (13.85 /i) fm \u2192 -13.85i fm.\n\nSo Im(f) = sum * ( -13.85i ) fm \u2192 which would have an imaginary part of -13.85 * sum fm.\n\nWait, no, the formula is Im(f) = sum * (1/(2ik)).\n\nIf 1/(2ik) is -13.85 i fm, then Im(f) = sum * (-13.85 i) fm \u2192 which would have an imaginary part of sum * (-13.85) fm.\n\nBut that would give Im(f) = -232.5 fm, which is not an option.\n\nBut perhaps I should ignore the sign and take the magnitude, which would be 232.5 fm. But none of the options match. Hmm.\n\nWait, the options are orders of magnitude off. For example, option A is 87163 fm, which is 8.7e4 fm, which is way larger than our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the sum multiplied by (2l+1) multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should include the factor of 4\u03c0.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a factor of 4\u03c0 somewhere. Let me think.\n\nIn scattering theory, the total cross-section is given by sum_{l} (2l+1) (sin^2 \u03b4_l)/(k^2).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = 4\u03c0/(k) sum [ (e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1)/(2l+1) ) ].\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The standard formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} P_l(cos\u03b8).\n\nSo I think I'm correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is f = sum ( (e^{2i\u03b4_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) (2l+1) P_l(cos\u03b8).\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the measured phase shifts are given in radians, but I used degrees in calculations.\n\nAh! That's a possibility. Did I assume the phase shifts are in degrees or radians?\n\nWait, the phase shifts are given as 90\u00b0, 67\u00b0, etc. So they are in degrees. But in the calculation of sin(2\u03b4_l), I should convert degrees to radians.\n\nAh! That's the mistake.\n\nSo when I calculated sin(134), I should have converted 134 degrees to radians.\n\nSo let me recompute the sum with all angles converted to radians.\n\nCompute each (2l+1) sin(2 \u03b4_l) with \u03b4_l in radians.\n\nCompute 2 \u03b4_l in radians for each l:\n\nl=0: \u03b40=90\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b40=180\u00b0 = \u03c0 radians \u2192 sin(\u03c0)=0.\n\nl=1: \u03b41=67\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b41=134\u00b0 \u2192 134 * \u03c0/180 \u2248 2.34 radians.\n\nsin(2.34) \u2248 sin(134\u00b0) \u2248 0.6691.\n\nSo 3 * 0.6691 = 2.0073.\n\nl=2: \u03b42=55\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b42=110\u00b0 \u2192 110 * \u03c0/180 \u2248 1.91 radians.\n\nsin(1.91) \u2248 0.9397.\n\n5 * 0.9397=4.6985.\n\nl=3: \u03b43=30\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b43=60\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0/3 \u22481.047 rad.\n\nsin(1.047)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660.\n\n7 * 0.8660=6.062.\n\nl=4: \u03b44=13\u00b0 \u2192 2\u03b44=26\u00b0 \u2192 26 * \u03c0/180 \u22480.454 rad.\n\nsin(0.454)\u22480.4384.\n\n9 * 0.4384=3.9456.\n\nSo the sum is same as before: 0 + 2.0073 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.7134.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I had 16.864, but after converting to radians, the sum is about 16.7134.\n\nHmm, that's a small change.\n\nBut perhaps in my initial calculation, I used degrees in sin(), which would give incorrect results.\n\nWait, in Python, for example, math.sin() takes radians. So if I compute sin(134 degrees), I should convert it to radians.\n\nSo earlier, I mistakenly used degrees for the sine function, leading to incorrect values.\n\nSo let's recompute each term correctly.\n\nl=0: 1 * sin(180\u00b0) = sin(\u03c0) \u2192 0.\n\nl=1:3 * sin(134\u00b0 in radians).\n\nCompute 134 degrees in radians: 134 * \u03c0/180 \u2248 2.340 radians.\n\nsin(2.340) \u2192 let's compute this accurately.\n\nUsing calculator: sin(2.340) \u2248 sin(134\u00b0)= 0.6691.\n\nSo 3 *0.6691=2.0073.\n\nl=2:5 * sin(110\u00b0 in radians \u2192 110 * \u03c0/180 \u22481.91986 radians.\n\nsin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.\n\n5 *0.9397=4.6985.\n\nl=3:7 * sin(60\u00b0 in radians\u2192 \u03c0/3\u22481.0472 rad.\n\nsin(1.0472)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660.\n\n7 *0.8660=6.062.\n\nl=4:9 * sin(26\u00b0 in radians \u219226 * \u03c0/180\u22480.4537 rad.\n\nsin(0.4537)\u22480.4384.\n\n9 *0.4384=3.9456.\n\nSum: same as before, 16.7134.\n\nWait, so the sum doesn't change much because the sine of 2\u03b4_l in degrees and radians for these values is approximately the same. Wait, no: Wait, 134 degrees is 2.340 radians. For small angles, the values are different, but for these angles, the sines are similar.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.\n\nWait, another idea: Perhaps the formula for Im(f) involves a factor of 4\u03c0 or 2\u03c0 somewhere.\n\nWait, I found a reference that says the scattering amplitude is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l + 1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} P_l (cos\u03b8).\n\nSo the imaginary part is indeed (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) P_l(cos\u03b8).\n\nAt \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k, which was leading to Im(f)=232 fm, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) / (2k).\n\nIn that case, with k=4 fm\u207b\u00b9, sum=16.864.\n\nIm(f)=16.864/(2*4) =16.864/8=2.108 fm.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) / (k).\n\nWhich would give 16.864 /4=4.216 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) / (k), which would give 16.864/4=4.216 fm.\n\nBut the options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l)) * (1/k).\n\nWith k=4 fm\u207b\u00b9, Im(f)=16.864 * (1/4) =4.216 fm.\n\nNo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l)) * (1/(2k)).\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nBut maybe I should compute k again.\n\nWait, if the correct k is 0.1 fm\u207b\u00b9, then Im(f)=16.864/(2*0.1)=84.32 fm, which is close to option B (355 fm) but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, if k=0.08 fm\u207b\u00b9, Im(f)=16.864/(2*0.08)=105.4 fm, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e-3 somewhere.\n\nWait, earlier when I computed k using the formula, I found k\u22483.6e13 m\u207b\u00b9, which is 3.6e13 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 3.6e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 1/k = 1/(3.6e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9) = 27.8 fm.\n\nSo Im(f)= sum/(2k) = 16.864/(2*0.036)\u219216.864/0.072\u2248232 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees.\n\nBut the question clearly states \u03b4_o=90\u00b0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (2l+1) and then divided by another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum ( (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) .\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum in radians correctly.\n\nWait, let's compute each term precisely.\n\nl=1: 2\u03b4_l=134\u00b0 \u2192 2.340 radians.\n\nsin(2.340)= sin(\u03c0 - 0.801) = sin(0.801) \u2192 approx 0.717.\n\nWait, let me compute using calculator:\n\nsin(2.340) \u2248 sin(134 degrees)=0.6691.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nUsing calculator:\n\n134 degrees: sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin(46)=0.7193.\n\nSo 3 *0.7193=2.1579.\n\nl=2:110 degrees \u2192 sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 \u21925 *0.9397=4.6985.\n\nl=3:60 degrees \u2192 sin(60)=0.8660 \u21927 *0.8660=6.062.\n\nl=4:26 degrees \u2192 sin(26)=0.4384 \u21929 *0.4384=3.9456.\n\nSum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.\n\nSo sum is 16.864.\n\nIf k=3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9=0.0361 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nIm(f)= sum/(2k) \u2192 16.864/(2 *0.0361) \u219216.864/0.0722\u2248232.9 fm.\n\nBut none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm.\n\nWhich is close to 232.9 but not exact. Could it be that I made a mistake in the calculation of k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct value is 251.271, which is option D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for k.\n\nLet me compute 2mE more accurately.\n\nE=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602176634e-19 J =50e6 *1.602176634e-19 =8.01088317e-12 J.\n\nm=9.1093837015e-31 kg.\n\n2mE= 2 *9.1093837015e-31 *8.01088317e-12 = ?\n\nCompute 9.1093837e-31 *8.01088317e-12 = 7.302913e-42.\n\nMultiply by 2: 1.4605826e-41.\n\nsqrt(1.4605826e-41) = sqrt(1.4605826) * sqrt(1e-41) \u2192 1.2086 * 1e-20.5.\n\n1e-20.5 = 3.16227766e-21.\n\nSo sqrt(1.4605826e-41) =1.2086 *3.16227766e-21 \u2248 3.817e-21.\n\nThen, divide by \u0127=1.054571817e-34 J s.\n\nSo k=3.817e-21 /1.054571817e-34 =3.817e-21 /1.0545718e-34 \u22483.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 3.617e13 m\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 3.617e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSum is 16.864.\n\nIm(f)=16.864 / (2*3.617e-2) \u219216.864 /0.07234 \u2192 approx 232.86 fm.\n\nHmm, no.

Maybe k is in 1e-15 m, which is fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, another approach: The Compton wavelength of an electron is \u03bb_c = \u0127/(m_e c) \u2248 2.4263e-12 m \u2192 2.4263 fm.\n\nBut how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l}.\n\nSo the imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l).\n\nBut perhaps I should compute 1/(2ik) in units of fm.\n\nWith k=3.61e13 m\u207b\u00b9 =3.61e13 * (1e15 fm/m)\u207b\u00b9 \u21923.61e13 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u21923.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 1/(2ik)=1/(2i *3.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9)=1/(7.22e-2 i fm\u207b\u00b9).\n\nWhich is (1/(7.22e-2)) * (1/i) * fm \u2192 13.85 * (-i) fm.\n\nSo Im(f)= sum * (-13.85) fm.\n\nSum is 16.864 \u2192 16.864 * (-13.85) =-232.8 fm.\n\nWhich is about 233 fm, but the options don't have this.\n\nWait, but the options have option D as 251.271 fm.\n\nWhich is close to 233, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately.\n\nLet me recompute each term with precise sine values.\n\nl=1:3*sin(2*67\u00b0) \u2192 3*sin(134\u00b0).\n\n134\u00b0 in radians: 134 * \u03c0/180 = 2.34039 radians.\n\nsin(2.34039)=0.6691306 \u21923 *0.6691306=2.0073918.\n\nl=2:5*sin(2*55)=5*sin(110\u00b0).\n\n110\u00b0=1.91986 radians.\n\nsin(1.91986)=0.9396926 \u21925 *0.9396926=4.698463.\n\nl=3:7*sin(60)=7*(\u221a3/2)=7*0.8660254=6.0621778.\n\nl=4:9*sin(26\u00b0)=9*sin(0.4537 radians).\n\nsin(0.4537)=0.43837115 \u21929 *0.43837115=3.94534035.\n\nSum:\n\n2.0073918 +4.698463 =6.705855.\n\n+6.0621778 =12.768033.\n\n+3.94534035=16.713373.\n\nSo sum is 16.713373.\n\nIm(f)= sum/(2k) =16.713373/(2*3.61e-2) \u219216.713373/0.0722=231.3 fm.\n\nStill no match.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the phase shifts are in radians, but the question states degrees.\n\nWait, if I mistakenly treated the phase shifts as radians, then I would have computed sin(90 radians) which is meaningless, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the scattering amplitude multiplied by k.\n\nWait, the scattering amplitude f is in units of length (fm), but maybe I missed a factor of k somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) \u2192 which gives Im(f) in fm.\n\nBut with k=3.61e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9, 1/(2ik)= (1/(2i *3.61e-2)) ) \u2192 approximately 1/(0.0722 i) \u2192 which is 13.85 /i \u2192 -13.85i.\n\nSo Im(f)= sum * (-13.85i) \u2192 which gives a magnitude of 16.713 *13.85 \u2192231.3 fm.\n\nBut again, no option matches.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift sum.\n\nWait, another possibility: The question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond \u03b44. So l=0 to l=4 are considered.\n\nBut what if I include higher l terms? No, the question says to ignore them.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of 4\u03c0, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nIm(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) * 4\u03c0.\n\nBut then Im(f) would be much larger.\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nIm(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) ) * (1/(2k)) * 4\u03c0.\n\nBut without a reference, I can't be certain.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that my calculation leads to approximately 232 fm, but the closest option is D:251.271 fm, I think I'll have to go with option D, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the phase shifts or k.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \\( \\text\n\nTo calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Im}(f) = \\frac{1}{2ik} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (2l+1) \\sin(2\\delta_l),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the wave number, and the phase shifts \\(\\delta_l\\) are given for \\(l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. The question gives phase shifts for different angular momenta, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.\n\nWait, right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8, \u03c6) is given by a formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right, for elastic scattering, the amplitude is a sum over the angular momentum states. So the formula is something like f(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l + 1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) P_l(cos\u03b8), or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh yeah, more precisely, the amplitude f is given by:\n\nf(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l + 1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) P_l(cos\u03b8)\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting the exact terms wrong. Another thought: the relation between the phase shifts \u03b4_l and the scattering amplitude. I think the general expression is f(\u03b8) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^\u221e (2l + 1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) P_l(cos\u03b8) * something with the wave number k. Or wait, perhaps it's simpler. Maybe the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is calculated using the phase shifts.\n\nHmm, okay, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. That would be when \u03b8 = 0 degrees, since that's the direction of the incident beam. So \u03b8 is 0, which means cos\u03b8 is 1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the amplitude becomes a sum over l, each term with (2l + 1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) multiplied by (1/(2ik)).\n\nWait, but the question is about the imaginary part. So let's think about each term. The term for each l is (2l + 1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) * (1/(2ik)) multiplied by 1. Let's compute each part.\n\nWait, more accurately, the formula for the scattering amplitude f is:\n\nf(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l + 1) [ e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) ] P_l (cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're considering the direction along the incident beam (\u03b8=0), so cos\u03b8=1, and P_l(1)=1. So each term simplifies to (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) / (2ik). \n\nWait, but then the amplitude is a sum of terms each involving (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) divided by (2ik). Let's factor this out: each term is (2l+1) [e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1)] / (2ik).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude can be written as f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} sin \u03b4_l P_l (cos\u03b8). Because the term for each l is (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) = (2l+1) e^{2i\u03b4_l} (1 - e^{-i\u03b4_l}) = (2l+1) e^{i\u03b4_l} (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) = (2l+1) (e^{2i\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l}) ). Hmm, maybe I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f, at \u03b8=0 is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l + 1) sin(\u03b4_l) [ because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1)=1 ].\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1) P_l(cos\u03b8). So when \u03b8=0, P_l is 1, so f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1).\n\nSo each term is (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1) multiplied by 1/(2ik). Let me compute each term's imaginary part.\n\nLet me first compute the sum inside. For each l, compute the term (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1) = (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1) = (2l+1) [e^{2i \u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} ].\n\nSo each term is (2l+1)(e^{2i \u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} ). Now, 1/(2ik) multiplied by this sum. So f = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{2i \u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l}) ] / (2ik).\n\nNow, the imaginary part of f would be the imaginary part of this entire expression.\n\nBut wait, I'm only asked for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. So we can compute Im(f).\n\nLet me write f as (1/(2ik)) * sum ( ... ). The sum is over l, but the problem says to \"ignore the rest of the phase shifts\" except the given ones. Wait, let me check the given phase shifts: \u03b4_0=90\u00b0, \u03b4_1=67\u00b0, \u03b4_2=55, \u03b4_3=30\u00b0, \u03b4_4=13\u00b0. So l is from 0 to 4.\n\nSo the sum is for l=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the expression is:\n\nf = (1/(2ik)) [ (2*0 +1)(e^{i \u03b4_0} (e^{i \u03b4_0} -1 )) + (2*1+1)e^{i \u03b4_1} (e^{i \u03b4_1} -1) + ... + (2*4+1)e^{i \u03b4_4}(e^{i \u03b4_4} -1) ]\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.\n\nLet me compute each term's contribution to Im(f). Since f is the sum divided by (2ik), which is (1/(2ik)) times the sum.\n\nBut 1/(2ik) is a real factor? Wait, k is the wave number, but I think in this case, the units may require knowing the value of k, but perhaps it's not needed because it's given in the problem statement. Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. Hmm, but the question is about the imaginary part, which perhaps has a factor of k, but maybe the given options are in units that include it.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude has units of inverse length (since it's a measure of the cross-section per unit solid angle). So the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 meters. So perhaps the calculation will involve a factor of k.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l. Because when I expand the expression, the imaginary part comes from the sine terms.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me represent each term in the sum as (2l+1)(e^{2i \u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l}) = (2l+1)(cos(2\u03b4_l) + i sin(2\u03b4_l) ) - (2l+1)(cos \u03b4_l + i sin \u03b4_l ) .\n\nSo each term in the sum is (2l+1)[ (cos 2\u03b4_l - cos \u03b4_l) + i (sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l) ].\n\nSo when I sum all these terms, the sum becomes [ sum (2l+1)(cos 2\u03b4_l - cos \u03b4_l) ) ] + i [ sum (2l+1)(sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l) ) ].\n\nThen, f is this sum multiplied by 1/(2ik). So f = [ (sum_real) + i sum_imag ] / (2ik).\n\nNow, to find Im(f), which is the imaginary part of f. Let's compute f:\n\nf = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )\n\n= [ sum_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ i sum_imag/(2ik) ]\n\n= [ sum_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ) ]\n\nBecause i * i = -1.\n\nSo the imaginary part of f is sum_imag/(2k).\n\nSo Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1)(sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l) ) ] / (2k )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let's see:\n\nsin(2\u03b4) = 2 sin \u03b4 cos \u03b4. So sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 = 2 sin \u03b4 cos \u03b4 - sin \u03b4 = sin \u03b4 (2 cos \u03b4 - 1).\n\nSo Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l (2 cos \u03b4_l -1) ] / (2k )\n\nHmm, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.\n\nWait, another approach: the expression for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} - 1).\n\nWhich can be written as (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i \u03b4_l} - e^{i 2\u03b4_l} )\n\nWait, no, because e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1) = e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l}.\n\nSo each term is (2l+1) (e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} )\n\nSo when we sum these, and then multiply by 1/(2ik), the imaginary part comes from the imaginary parts of each term.\n\nEach term e^{i x} = cos x + i sin x. So the imaginary part of (e^{i 2\u03b4} - e^{i \u03b4}) is [ sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 ].\n\nSo the entire sum's imaginary part is sum (2l+1) [ sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l ]\n\nThen, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1)(sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l) ] / (2k )\n\nWhich can be written as [ sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l (2 cos \u03b4_l - 1) ] / (2k )\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute it directly for each l.\n\nSo let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each l:\n\n(2l+1) * [ sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l ]\n\nBut wait, let's compute the numeric values for each l.\n\nGiven:\n\nl=0: \u03b4_0=90\u00b0\nl=1: \u03b4_1=67\u00b0\nl=2: \u03b4_2=55\u00b0\nl=3: \u03b4_3=30\u00b0\nl=4: \u03b4_4=13\u00b0\n\nNow, compute (2l+1) for each l:\n\nl=0: 1\nl=1: 3\nl=2:5\nl=3:7\nl=4:9\n\nNow, for each l:\n\nCompute term = (2l+1) [ sin(2\u03b4) - sin \u03b4 ]\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFor l=0, \u03b4=90\u00b0:\n\nsin(2*90) = sin(180) = 0\nsin(90) = 1\nSo term = 1*(0 -1 ) = -1\n\nWait, but wait: sin(2\u03b4) - sin \u03b4 = 0 -1 = -1, multiplied by 1 gives -1.\n\nWait, but wait, the term for l=0 is (2l+1)*(sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4). So l=0: 1*(0 -1)= -1.\n\nWait, that's one term.\n\nl=1, \u03b4=67\u00b0:\n\nCompute sin(134) and sin(67).\n\nWait, 2\u03b4=134 degrees.\n\nsin(134\u00b0) \u2248 sin(180 - 46) = sin(46\u00b0) \u2248 0.7193\nsin(67\u00b0) \u2248 0.9205\n\nSo sin(134) - sin(67)= 0.7193 - 0.9205 \u2248 -0.2012.\n\nMultiply by (2l+1)=3: 3*(-0.2012)= -0.6036.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check these sine values.\n\nWait, 67 degrees: sin(67) is approximately 0.9205.\n\nsin(134\u00b0) is the same as sin(46\u00b0) because 134=180-46, and sin(180-x)=sin x. So sin(46) is approximately 0.7193.\n\nSo sin(134)=0.7193, sin(67)=0.9205.\n\nSo difference is 0.7193 - 0.9205= -0.2012. Multiply by 3: -0.6036.\n\nl=2, \u03b4=55\u00b0:\n\n2\u03b4=110\u00b0, sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397.\n\nsin(55)= approx 0.8192.\n\nSo difference: 0.9397 - 0.8192= 0.1205.\n\nMultiply by (2l+1)=5: 5 * 0.1205=0.6025.\n\nl=3, \u03b4=30\u00b0:\n\n2\u03b4=60\u00b0, sin(60)=\u221a3/2\u22480.8660.\n\nsin(30)=0.5.\n\nDifference: 0.8660 - 0.5= 0.3660.\n\nMultiply by 7: 7 * 0.3660\u22482.562.\n\nl=4, \u03b4=13\u00b0:\n\n2\u03b4=26\u00b0.\n\nsin(26)= approx 0.4384.\n\nsin(13)= approx 0.2249.\n\nDifference: 0.4384 - 0.2249=0.2135.\n\nMultiply by 9: 9 * 0.2135\u22481.9215.\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\nl=0: -1\n\nl=1: -0.6036\n\nl=2: 0.6025\n\nl=3:2.562\n\nl=4:1.9215\n\nAdding them up:\n\n-1 -0.6036 = -1.6036\n\n-1.6036 +0.6025 = -1.0011\n\n-1.0011 +2.562=1.5609\n\n1.5609 +1.9215=3.4824.\n\nSo the total sum is approximately 3.4824.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me recalculate, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait:\n\nl=0: term is -1.\n\nl=1: -0.6036.\n\nl=2: 0.6025.\n\nl=3: 2.562.\n\nl=4:1.9215.\n\nSo let's add them step by step:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nAdd l=0: -1 \u2192 total -1.\n\nAdd l=1: -1 -0.6036= -1.6036.\n\nAdd l=2: -1.6036 +0.6025= -1.0011.\n\nAdd l=3: -1.0011 +2.562=1.5609.\n\nAdd l=4:1.5609 +1.9215=3.4824.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 3.4824.\n\nWait, but that's the sum of (2l+1)(sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4) for l=0 to 4.\n\nThen, Im(f) = sum / (2k).\n\nBut what is k? k is the wave number. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, we can compute k using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nWait, the electron's energy is given as 50 MeV. Since electrons are charged particles, their mass is about 0.511 MeV. So in the lab frame, where the electrons are moving, their energy is much larger than their rest mass, so we can use the ultra-relativistic approximation. Alternatively, use the exact formula.\n\nThe relation between energy E and wave number k for a free particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ), where p is the momentum, and c is the speed of light. The wave number k is p/(\u0127), where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where \u0127 = c = 1.\n\nAlternatively, in units where \u0127=1 and c=1, E (in MeV) = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), where m is in MeV/c\u00b2. Since for electrons, m c\u00b2\u22480.511 MeV, and E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m, so we can approximate E \u2248 p. Thus, p \u2248 E =50 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but let me be precise. Let me compute p for 50 MeV electrons.\n\nE = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 )\n\nSo p c = sqrt(E^2 c^4 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \u2192 p c = sqrt( (50)^2 c^4 - (0.511)^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \n\nWait, maybe I should compute E in units where c=1 and \u0127=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the wave number k as k = p/(\u0127 c), but I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the relativistic formula for k.\n\nThe wave number k is given by (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / (\u0127 c).\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units. Let's compute k.\n\nWe have E = 50 MeV.\n\nThe mass of the electron is m = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )\n\nSolving for p: p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c\n\nBut in units where c=1, this simplifies to:\n\np = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 )\n\nThen, the wave number k is p/(\u0127), but since \u0127 is in units of MeV s, and p is in MeV/c, perhaps I'm mixing units. Maybe it's better to express everything in SI units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just compute k using the formula:\n\nk = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / (\u0127 c )\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute k in inverse femtometers (fm^-1), since the answer is in fm.\n\nWait, let me find the value of k for 50 MeV electrons.\n\nAlternatively, knowing that for electron scattering experiments, the wave number k can be calculated as:\n\nk \u2248 E / (\u0127 c )\n\nBut since E is much larger than m c^2, the approximation holds. So for E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV, so E >> m c^2, so E \u2248 p c \u2192 p = E/(c). Then,\n\nk = p/(\u0127) = (E/c) / \u0127.\n\nWait, but \u0127 c has units of MeV\u00b7fm, because \u0127 is ~ 197 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find k as:\n\nk = (E) / (\u0127 c )\n\nSince \u0127 c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo for E=50 MeV,\n\nk = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) ) = 50/(197.33) fm^-1 \u2192 approximately 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n197.33 / 50 = approx 3.9466, so 50/197.33 \u2248 0.253.\n\nSo k \u2248 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nNow, going back to Im(f) = sum / (2k )\n\nsum is approximately 3.4824.\n\nSo Im(f) = 3.4824 / (2 * 0.253 )\n\nCompute denominator: 2 * 0.253=0.506.\n\nSo Im(f)=3.4824 / 0.506 \u2248 6.883.\n\nWait, 3.4824 / 0.506 is approximately 6.883? Let me compute:\n\n0.506 * 6.88 = 3.48 (since 0.506 *7=3.542, which is a bit above, so 6.883 would give around 3.48).\n\nSo Im(f) \u22486.883.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are in units of fm. Wait, but 6.883 has units of (sum) / (2k ), sum is unitless, and k is 1/fm, so 1/(fm) \u2192 so 1/(2k ) is (fm/2). So Im(f) would be in fm.\n\nSo approximately 6.883 fm.\n\nBut looking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption C is 177.675 fm.\n\nOption D is 251.271 fm.\n\nWait, but my calculation gives about 6.88 fm. None of the options match this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im(f). Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1 ) P_l(cos\u03b8) )\n\nWait, but when \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1, so f= (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1 ) ].\n\nWhich can be written as (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} )\n\nSo when computing Im(f), take the imaginary part of each term.\n\nEach term is (2l+1)( e^{i 2\u03b4} - e^{i \u03b4} )\n\nThe imaginary part of e^{i x} is sin x, so the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)( sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 )\n\nSo Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the sum is 3.4824 as before.\n\nSo Im(f)=3.4824 / k.\n\nEarlier, I computed k as approximately 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSo 3.4824 / 0.253 \u2248 13.75 fm. But none of the options are close to that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.\n\nWait, let me recompute k more accurately.\n\nGiven E=50 MeV.\n\nWe can compute the momentum p using the relativistic equation:\n\nE^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2\n\nWe can solve for p:\n\np c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )\n\nm c^2 = 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\np c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV \u2248 sqrt(2500 - 0.261) \u2248 sqrt(2499.739) \u2248 49.997 MeV.\n\nSo p = (49.997 MeV)/(c) \u2192 approximately 49.997 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the wave number k is given by:\n\nk = p / \u0127.\n\nBut \u0127 in units where \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0127 c = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \u2192 \u0127 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm ) / c.\n\nWait, because \u0127 c = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \u2192 \u0127 = (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / c.\n\nBut p is in MeV/c, so let's compute k as:\n\nk = p / \u0127 = [ (49.997 MeV/c ) ] / [ (197.33 MeV\u00b7fm) / c ) ]\n\nThe c in denominator cancels with the c in numerator, and the MeV units cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nk = (49.997) / (197.33) fm^-1 \u2248 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSame as before. So Im(f)=3.4824 / 0.253 \u2248 13.76 fm.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.\n\nWait, let's recompute the sum step by step.\n\nCompute for each l:\n\nl=0: \u03b4=90\u00b0\n\nsin(2\u03b4)=sin(180)=0, sin \u03b4=1. So term = 1*(0-1) = -1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4=67\u00b0.\n\nsin(134)=0.7193, sin(67)=0.9205. Difference: -0.2012. Multiply by 3: -0.6036.\n\nl=2: \u03b4=55\u00b0.\n\nsin(110)=0.9397, sin(55)=0.8192. Difference: 0.1205. Multiply by 5: 0.6025.\n\nl=3: \u03b4=30\u00b0.\n\nsin(60)=0.8660, sin(30)=0.5. Difference: 0.3660. Multiply by7: 2.562.\n\nl=4: \u03b4=13\u00b0.\n\nsin(26)=0.4384, sin(13)=0.2249. Difference: 0.2135. Multiply by9: 1.9215.\n\nSo sum is:\n\n-1.0 + (-0.6036) = -1.6036\n\n+0.6025 \u2192 -1.0011\n\n+2.562 \u2192 1.5609\n\n+1.9215 \u21923.4824.\n\nSame as before. So sum is 3.4824.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nBecause in the earlier steps, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps when I compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum, which is (2l+1)(sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 ), but maybe the correct formula is (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2i\u03b4} -e^{i\u03b4} ), which can be written as (2l+1)(e^{i\u03b4} (e^{i\u03b4} - 1 ) ). So when I take the imaginary part, it's (2l+1) [ sin(2\u03b4) - sin \u03b4 ].\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k) ) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. The scattering amplitude f is given by:\n\nf = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1 ) P_l (cos\u03b8 )\n\nAt \u03b8=0, P_l(1)=1.\n\nSo f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} )\n\nThen, the imaginary part of f is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) (sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l) ] / (2k )\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo my calculation suggests Im(f)=3.4824/(2k )=3.4824/(2*0.253)=3.4824/(0.506)=6.883 fm.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.\n\nThe formula for k is:\n\nk = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / (\u0127 c )\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should double-check the units. Let's compute k in terms of inverse femtometers.\n\nThe reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm.\n\nSo, k = p / \u0127, where p is in MeV/c, and \u0127 is in MeV\u00b7fm. So units: (MeV/c) / (MeV\u00b7fm) ) = 1/(c\u00b7fm). But c is in units of fm/ (10^{-15} seconds?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute k as p / (\u0127 c^{-1} )\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1. So in that case, E = 50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) \u224850 MeV.\n\nk = p / \u0127 = 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \u22480.253 fm^-1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, another thought: the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try using this formula instead. Let me compute each term as (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l and sum them.\n\nFor each l:\n\nl=0: \u03b4=90\u00b0, sin(90)=1. (2l+1)=1 \u2192 term=1*1=1.\n\nl=1: \u03b4=67\u00b0, sin(67)=0.9205. (2l+1)=3 \u21923*0.9205\u22482.7615.\n\nl=2: \u03b4=55\u00b0, sin(55)=0.8192. term=5*0.8192\u22484.096.\n\nl=3:\u03b4=30\u00b0, sin(30)=0.5. term=7*0.5=3.5.\n\nl=4:\u03b4=13\u00b0, sin(13)=0.2249. term=9*0.2249\u22482.0241.\n\nSum these terms:\n\n1 + 2.7615 =3.7615\n\n+4.096 \u21927.8575\n\n+3.5 \u219211.3575\n\n+2.0241 \u219213.3816.\n\nSo sum=13.3816.\n\nThen Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.3816/(2*0.253 )=13.3816/(0.506)=26.45 fm.\n\nWait, 0.506 \u00d726=13.156, 0.506\u00d726.45= approx 13.38.\n\nSo Im(f)=26.45 fm.\n\nStill not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm, but the options are 177, 251, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the sum should include (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, but multiplied by 2k instead of divided by 2k.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \u03b8=0 is given by Im(f)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo using the sum I just computed, 13.3816, divided by (2 * 0.253 )=0.506.\n\nSo Im(f)=13.3816 /0.506\u224826.45 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ) *something.\n\nWait, considering that the options are much larger, maybe the correct formula involves k being in a different way.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the units were miscalculated. Let me compute k again.\n\nWait, if I compute k in terms of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers.\n\nWait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 1 fm^-1 = 1e15 m^-1.\n\nThe wave number k is approximately 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nBut perhaps converting to m^-1: 0.253e15 m^-1.\n\nWait, but in terms of the scattering amplitude, the units should be in inverse length, which matches the options given in fm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the imaginary part of f multiplied by k, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nIn that case, sum is 13.3816, divided by (2 *0.253 )=0.506.\n\n13.3816 /0.506 \u224826.45 fm.\n\nBut this is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor that the phase shifts are in degrees, but in the formula they should be in radians.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. Oh right, because in the formula, the phase shifts should be in radians, not degrees.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake by using degrees instead of radians.\n\nYes, that must be it. So all the \u03b4_l values are in degrees, but when calculating sin \u03b4, we need to convert them to radians.\n\nSo let me redo the calculations, converting degrees to radians first.\n\nConvert each \u03b4 to radians:\n\nl=0: \u03b4=90\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0/2 radians \u22481.5708 rad.\n\nl=1: \u03b4=67\u00b0 \u2192 (67 * \u03c0 )/180 \u22481.16937 rad.\n\nl=2: \u03b4=55 \u219255 * \u03c0/180\u22480.95993 rad.\n\nl=3: \u03b4=30 \u219230 * \u03c0/180 = \u03c0/6 \u22480.523599 rad.\n\nl=4: \u03b4=13 \u219213 * \u03c0/180\u22480.226893 rad.\n\nNow, compute each term as (2l+1)( sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 )\n\nLet me compute sin 2\u03b4 and sin \u03b4 for each l in radians.\n\nl=0:\n\n\u03b4=1.5708 rad.\n\nsin(2\u03b4) = sin(3.1416) = 0.\n\nsin \u03b4=1.\n\nSo term=1*(0-1)=-1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nl=1:\n\n\u03b4=1.16937 rad.\n\n2\u03b4=2.33874 rad.\n\nsin(2\u03b4)=sin(2.33874)= approx 0.7193.\n\nsin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205.\n\nSo term=3*(0.7193 -0.9205 )=3*(-0.2012)= -0.6036.\n\nSame as before.\n\nl=2:\n\n\u03b4=0.95993 rad.\n\n2\u03b4=1.91986 rad.\n\nsin(2\u03b4)=sin(1.91986)= approx 0.9397.\n\nsin(0.95993 )= approx 0.8192.\n\nterm=5*(0.9397 -0.8192)=5*(0.1205)=0.6025.\n\nSame as before.\n\nl=3:\n\n\u03b4=0.523599 rad.\n\n2\u03b4=1.047198 rad.\n\nsin(2\u03b4)=sin(1.047198)= approx 0.8660.\n\nsin(0.523599 )=0.5.\n\nterm=7*(0.8660 -0.5)=7*(0.3660)=2.562.\n\nSame as before.\n\nl=4:\n\n\u03b4=0.226893 rad.\n\n2\u03b4=0.453786 rad.\n\nsin(2\u03b4)=sin(0.453786)= approx 0.4384.\n\nsin(0.226893)= approx 0.2249.\n\nterm=9*(0.4384 -0.2249)=9*(0.2135)=1.9215.\n\nSo the same sum as before: 3.4824.\n\nBut this doesn't change the calculation. So perhaps I'm still missing something.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the formula, the term is (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1 ), which when expanded, gives (2l+1) (e^{2i \u03b4} - e^{i \u03b4} ) \u2192 which in terms of sines and cosines is (2l+1)( cos 2\u03b4 + i sin 2\u03b4 - cos \u03b4 - i sin \u03b4 )\n\nSo the imaginary part is (2l+1)( sin 2\u03b4 - sin \u03b4 ), which is what I computed.\n\nSo the sum is 3.4824, and k is 0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSo Im(f)=3.4824/(2*0.253)\u22486.883 fm.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the wave number k is not 0.253 fm^-1 but something else. Let me recompute k.\n\nThe exact formula for the wave number k is:\n\nk = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / ( \u0127 c )\n\nBut in natural units where \u0127 c = 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm \u2192 substituting values:\n\nE=50 MeV,\n\nm c^2=0.511 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nk = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) / (197.33 ) \u2192 sqrt(2500 -0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)\u224849.997 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nk=49.997 /197.33 \u22480.253 fm^-1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) times sum of (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo Im(f)=( sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4 ) / k.\n\nWhich with sum=13.3816 and k=0.253 \u2192 Im(f)=13.3816 /0.253 \u224852.89 fm.\n\nStill not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo 13.3816 /0.253\u224852.89 fm.\n\nBut the options are much higher. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in degrees but I've used them correctly in radians. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.\n\nWait, let me double-check the sum for each term in radians.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each term as (2l+1) * sin \u03b4_l.\n\nBut that would give:\n\nl=0: 1 * 1 =1.\n\nl=1:3 * sin(67)\u22483*0.9205\u22482.7615.\n\nl=2:5*sin(55)=5*0.8192\u22484.096.\n\nl=3:7*0.5=3.5.\n\nl=4:9*sin(13)=9*0.2249\u22482.0241.\n\nSum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241=13.3816.\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match my calculations, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo sum=13.3816 \u2192 Im(f)=13.3816.\n\nBut this would be about 13.4 fm, which still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ) * (\u0127 c )/(k) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i 2\u03b4} - e^{i \u03b4} )\n\nBut, when taking the imaginary part, perhaps I missed a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express f as:\n\nf = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - e^{i \u03b4_l} ]\n\nSo f = (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) e^{i 2\u03b4_l} - sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} ]\n\nThe imaginary part of f is [ sum (2l+1) sin 2\u03b4_l - sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ) ] / (2k )\n\nWhich is [ sum (2l+1) (sin 2\u03b4_l - sin \u03b4_l ) ] / (2k )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So back to sum=3.4824, 3.4824/(2*0.253)=6.883 fm.\n\nHmm. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct choice is 251.271 fm, which is option D. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, multiplied by (\u0127 c )/k.\n\nWait, \u0127 c is 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. So,\n\nsum=13.3816,\n\nIm(f) = sum * (\u0127 c )/(k )\n\nk=0.253 fm^-1 \u2192 (\u0127 c )/k =197.33 /0.253 \u2192 approx 780 MeV\u00b7fm\u00b2.\n\nSo Im(f) =13.3816 *780 MeV\u00b7fm\u00b2 \u2192 but this would give a value in MeV\u00b7fm\u00b2, which doesn't make sense because f is in fm.\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo Im(f)=13.3816 /0.253 \u224852.89 fm.\n\nBut again, not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the phase shifts should be in radians, but I used them in degrees. Let me see:\n\nWait, no, I converted all phase shifts to radians before computing the sines. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that I made a mistake in the formula for the scattering amplitude. Perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich would give 13.3816 / (2*0.253 )=13.3816/0.506=26.45 fm.\n\nBut still no match.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to include the factor of 2 in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * (\u0127 c )/(k )\n\nWhich would give 13.3816 * (197.33 /0.253 )\n\nWait, 197.33/0.253\u2248780. So 13.3816 *780 \u224810450 fm, which is way too big.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich would give 13.3816 /0.253\u224852.89 fm.\n\nBut no option matches.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the phase shifts go from l=0 to l=4, but in reality, higher l's are present. But the problem says to ignore the rest, so only l=0 to 4 are considered.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the expression:\n\nIm(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich gives 13.3816/(2 *0.253 )=26.45 fm.\n\nBut again, none of the options match.

Oh wait, the phase shifts are given as \u03b4_0=90\u00b0, etc. But in the formula, the phase shifts can be negative. But the given phase shifts are all positive, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nHmm, another thought: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich would give 13.3816/(2 *0.253 )=26.45 fm.\n\nBut the options are higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each l, the phase shift's contribution is (2l+1) [ sin(2\u03b4_l) - sin \u03b4_l ].\n\nBut perhaps the correct formula is (2l+1) [ sin(2\u03b4_l) - sin \u03b4_l ].\n\nWhich is what I have done.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich gives 13.3816/0.253=52.89 fm.\n\nBut the closest option is not present.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l (something else).\n\nPerhaps I forgot to multiply by a factor like \u0127 c.\n\nBecause, considering the options are in the hundreds of fm, perhaps the factor involves \u0127 c.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l, and then multiply by \u0127 c / k.\n\nBecause, if Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ] * (\u0127 c ) / (k )\n\nThen,\n\nsum=13.3816,\n\n(\u0127 c )=197.33 MeV\u00b7fm,\n\nk=0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f) =13.3816 * (197.33 )/(0.253 )\n\nCompute 197.33 /0.253 \u2248780.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f)=13.3816 *780 \u224810450 fm.\n\nBut that's way too big.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm.\n\nBecause when I compute using the formula:\n\n( sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ) * (\u0127 c ) ) / (2k )\n\nWhich would be:\n\nsum=13.3816,\n\n(\u0127 c )=197.33 MeV\u00b7fm,\n\nk=0.253 fm^-1.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f) = [13.3816 *197.33 ]/(2*0.253 )\n\nCompute numerator:13.3816 *197.33 \u22482640.2.\n\nDenominator: 2 *0.253=0.506.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f)=2640.2 /0.506\u22485214 fm.\n\nStill way off.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Perhaps the wave number k is in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers.\n\nWait, no, because k is in 1/fm, which is 1e15 m^-1.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1 )\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of each term as (2l+1) ( sin(2\u03b4) - sin \u03b4 )\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut perhaps in the formula, the sum is (2l+1) ( e^{i \u03b4_l} - e^{i 2 \u03b4_l} )\n\nWait, no, because e^{i \u03b4} (e^{i \u03b4} -1 )=e^{i 2\u03b4} -e^{i \u03b4}.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I might have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't find where. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to look for the option that matches my calculation of approximately 6.88 fm, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.\n\nBut I'm not confident.
