Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the question is specifically about the pp-III branch stopping.

Wait, the pp chain... right. The proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe? Or is it the other branches? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we wouldn't have noticed the change yet because the neutrinos would have already reached us.

But neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp-III branch is a sub-process of the proton-proton chain. I think it's one of the later steps, perhaps involving the generation of carbon or something. But more importantly, this process emits neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux from that process would stop, but other processes might continue.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how much of each band comes from the pp-III branch versus other processes.

I remember that the dominant solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with lower energies, around 200-300 keV? Or maybe higher? Wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the so-called B8 (Brahmagupta) neutrinos, which are from the burning of boron in the CNO cycle, but wait, no, the CNO cycle is another fusion process.

Wait, no. The dominant source is the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are the pep and the main pp neutrinos. The main pp neutrinos have energies around 500-800 keV, I think. The pep neutrinos are lower energy, like 1-2 MeV? Or wait, no, maybe higher. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the main pp neutrinos are produced when a boron-8 nucleus captures an electron neutrino to become boron-9, which then decays into lithium-7 and emits a positron and two neutrinos. Each of those neutrinos has about 1.4 MeV energy. But wait, that can't be right because the neutrinos can't have more energy than the rest mass. Wait, maybe the neutrinos have lower energy.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the details. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the so-called B8 neutrinos, which are from the CNO cycle. Or wait, no, the CNO neutrinos are not as dominant as the pp. The main neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain's main branch, which emits neutrinos with energies around 500-800 keV. Then there's the pep branch, which is a small part, and emits neutrinos around 2.5 MeV or something.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the pp-III branch. I'm not exactly sure what the pp-III branch does. Let me think. The proton-proton chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium. Then another proton fuses to form helium-3. The helium-3 can either combine with another helium-3 to form boron-8 (pp-I branch), or one can combine with a helium-4 (but that's the CNO cycle maybe). Alternatively, the pp-III branch might involve something else.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor part of the proton-proton chain. For example, in the first step, two protons form a deuterium. Then they can fuse into tritium via the pp-II branch, but that's maybe a small part. Alternatively, the pp-III might be another process that produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III branch might contribute to the high-energy neutrinos. For example, some sources say that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor and emits neutrinos in higher energy ranges, like around 1 MeV or so.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos (like those above a certain threshold) would drop. Because the question is about the ratio of flux in two bands: band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV), which are both in the higher end of the neutrino energies.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch only contributes a small fraction of the total neutrino flux, then stopping it would reduce the flux in higher energy bands more than lower ones. Because the main pp branch (pp-I) produces neutrinos up to around 800 keV, maybe. So if pp-III emits more in higher energies, then stopping it would lower the flux above a certain point.

But the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2. Both bands are adjacent, but band 2 is higher. So if the pp-III branch produces more neutrinos in band 2 than in band 1, then stopping it would decrease the flux in band 2 more than in band 1, making the ratio higher.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about which neutrinos come from which processes.

The main neutrinos from the Sun are the B8 neutrinos, but wait, no—that's from the CNO cycle. Wait, no, the dominant neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the main branch, which produces neutrinos with energies around 500 keV to about 1.4 MeV. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the main pp chain neutrinos (from the dominant process) have energies up to around 1.4 MeV, but that's when considering the decay products.

Wait, perhaps the main branch produces neutrinos with energies around 500-800 keV (so band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV). If the main branch produces neutrinos up to about 800 keV, then the pp-III branch might contribute more to higher energies, like 800 keV and above.

Wait, alternatively, the pp-III branch might contribute neutrinos in higher energy ranges. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in higher bands would drop more.

So, before the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would have contributions from both the main pp branch and the pp-III branch. The main pp branch might have a flux that peaks around 800 keV, and then drops off. The pp-III might contribute a higher fraction at higher energies.

So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would be lower than before, but band 1 (700-800 keV) would be less affected because it's mostly from the main pp branch.

Therefore, the ratio of band 1 flux to band 2 flux would increase. Because without the pp-III, band 2's flux drops, so the ratio band1/band2 would be higher than before.

But wait, what was the flux ratio before the pp-III stopped? If the pp-III contributes more to band 2 than to band 1, then previously, the ratio was lower. Now, without that, the ratio goes up.

Suppose that band 2's flux was dominated by the pp-III. For example, perhaps the main pp branch contributes more to band 1, and the pp-III contributes more to band 2. So the flux in band 2 is higher than band 1 because of the pp-III.

Wait, but the main pp branch's neutrinos are in the 500-800 keV range. So their contribution to band 1 (700-800) is significant, and then to band 2 (800-900) is negligible. The pp-III, which stops, might contribute more to band 2.

So normally (before the pp-III stopped), the flux in band 1 is from the main pp branch, and band 2 is from both main pp and pp-III. So, if the main pp branch contributes F1 to band 1 and F2 to band 2, and the pp-III contributes F3 to band 2. So the total flux in band 2 is F2 + F3.

If the pp-III stops, then the flux in band 1 remains at F1, and the flux in band 2 drops to F2.

If F3 was a significant portion of the band 2 flux, then (F1)/(F2 + F3) could be less than 1. After stopping, it's (F1)/(F2). Since F2 + F3 was larger than F2, the ratio increases.

If, for example, F3 is about the same as F2, then the ratio would double. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp branch's neutrinos don't contribute much to band 2, and most of band 2 comes from pp-III. So after stopping, band 2 flux is almost gone, so the ratio becomes F1/ (almost zero) which would be very high, but that's probably not the case because the pp-III might contribute a small fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp branch contributes more to band 1 than band 2, and the pp-III contributes more to band 2.

Wait, but the question is about neutrino flux. Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The main proton-proton chain produces neutrinos with a spectrum peaking around 300 keV to about 1.4 MeV. The exact details are a bit hazy, but I think the main pp branch produces neutrinos with energies up to around 1.4 MeV, but the majority might be around 500 keV or so.

The pp-III branch is a minor part, perhaps producing higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (above, say, 800 keV) would drop. So the flux in band 2 (which is 800-900 keV) would be mostly from pp-III, while band 1 is from the main pp branch.

Wait, but the main pp branch might have a tail into band 1, but perhaps not much into band 2. So if the pp-III contributed most of band 2, then after stopping, band 2's flux would drop to almost zero. But the main branch still contributes band 1.

So, if band 2's flux was, say, 10% from main pp and 90% from pp-III, then after stopping pp-III, band 2's flux is 10% of what it was before. Band 1 might be 90% from main pp. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would go from (0.9)/(0.9 + 0.1) = 0.9/1.0 = 0.9 → to (0.9)/(0.1) = 9. So the ratio increases by a factor of 10.

But the question is about the flux ratio after the pp-III stops. So the ratio was initially 0.9, but after stopping, it becomes 9. So the ratio increased by a factor of 10.

Wait, but the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Hmm, so the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So if the ratio was 0.9 before, and becomes 9 after, then the ratio is 10 times higher. So the flux ratio band1/band2 would be 10.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let's think about the total neutrino flux. The main pp branch produces most of the neutrinos, so the majority of flux in band 1 (700-800) comes from the main branch. Band 2 (800-900) has some from the main branch and some from pp-III.

If the pp-III contributes a significant portion to band 2, but a negligible amount to band 1, then before stopping, band 2 flux is F2 = F_pp_main_high + F_ppIII. After stopping, F2 becomes F_pp_main_high.

So the ratio becomes:

band1_flux = F_pp_main_band1

band2_flux = F_pp_main_band2

So the flux ratio is F_pp_band1 / F_pp_band2.

If the main branch's flux in band1 is higher than band2, then the ratio would be greater than 1. If band1 has more flux, then the ratio would be greater than 1.

But I'm not sure about the actual numbers. Let me think about the pp neutrino spectrum.

According to some sources, the main proton-proton neutrinos have energies from about 0.3 to 1.4 MeV, with a peak around 0.6-0.8 MeV. So the flux in 700-800 keV is higher than in 800-900 keV, since the distribution is higher at lower energies. So if band1 (700-800) is the higher energy end of the main branch, but maybe the flux drops off beyond that.

So, if the main pp branch contributes more to band1 than band2, and the pp-III contributes more to band2, then when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops, making the ratio higher.

Suppose the main branch has 10 times as much flux in band1 as pp-III in band2. So, band1_flux = 10, band2_flux=1 (before stopping). Then the ratio is 10:1.

But if pp-III contributes to band2, say, adding another 5 units. Then before stopping, band2_flux = 1 + 5 =6. So the ratio is 10:6 ≈ 1.67.

After stopping, band2_flux=1, so ratio is 10:1=10.

So the ratio would be 10.

Which matches option A) 10.

Alternatively, if the main pp branch contributes about the same to band1 and band2, and pp-III contributes a lot to band2, then the ratio after stopping would be much higher.

But the exact numbers are tricky. But given the options, and the reasoning, I think the answer is A)10.

The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the total neutrino flux and is known to emit higher-energy neutrinos, particularly in the 800-900 keV range. The main proton-proton branch (pp-I) produces neutrinos with a spectrum peaking around 0.6-0.8 MeV, contributing significantly to the 700-800 keV band but with a much smaller tail extending into the 800-900 keV range.

Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) is significantly enhanced by the contribution from pp-III, while the 700-800 keV band (band 1) is dominated by the main pp branch. After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 decreases substantially, as the pp-III branch no longer contributes to it. In contrast, the flux in band 1 remains largely unaffected, as it is primarily sourced from the main pp branch.

The ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 increases because the flux in band 2 is reduced more significantly than the flux in band 1. If the pp-III branch contributes a large fraction of the flux in band 2, the ratio can increase by a factor of 10 or more. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 after the pp-III branch stops is **10**.
