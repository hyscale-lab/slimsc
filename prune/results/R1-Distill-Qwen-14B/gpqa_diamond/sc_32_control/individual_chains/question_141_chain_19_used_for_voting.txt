Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, what's that structure? 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because sometimes the numbering gets a little tricky. Or is it 1-bromo, 2-dimethylaminobenzene? I think that's right. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. 

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution, especially when activating groups are present, elimination reactions can occur. Wait, but in this case, the substituents—bromine is a deactivating group, and the dimethylamino group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when we have such substituents, what kind of reaction happens?

Wait, wait. The presence of a strong base like NaNH2 is probably leading to some kind of elimination. Maybe a benzene ring with a leaving group (like bromine) and an adjacent hydrogen that can be abstracted to form a double bond. So in such cases, elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, which is an aromatic compound, but wait, benzene is already aromatic. Oh, wait, perhaps the bromine is in a position where elimination can form a diene? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is leaving as Br- and a neighboring proton is abstracted, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in another position. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds. So if a substituent is present, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's beta to the bromine, leading to the formation of a new double bond.

Wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. If the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the bromine, like at position 3 or position 6. Or maybe position 4? Let me draw this out mentally. The ring has Br at position 1, and (N(CH3)2) at position 2. So positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. But 2 is already taken by the dimethylamino group. So the adjacent position is 6. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 is already substituted with a bulky group, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base but not a typical nucleophile in aromatic substitution. Since the ring has strong activating groups, perhaps the bromide could be replaced, but I'm not sure. Wait, but aromatic substitution usually requires specific conditions, like a good leaving group and activating groups to facilitate the attack. But since we have a dimethylamino group which is strong activating, maybe the bromide could be replaced by something else. But in this reaction, the nucleophile is likely an amide ion (NH2^-), but I'm not sure if it's attacking here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Wait, but dimethylamino is a strong activating group for electrophilic substitution. For nucleophilic substitution, the ring typically needs to be deactivated, but in this case, it's activated. Hmm, maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility is elimination, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the dimethylamino group is deprotonated, but that doesn't make sense because it's a strong base. Wait, but NH2^- is a strong base; maybe it abstracts a proton from the ring. Let me think: the substituents are Br at 1 and NMe2 at 2. The ring is activated in certain positions. The base could abstract a proton that's in a position leading to a new substitution.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is similar to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond? No, that doesn't make sense because benzene is fully conjugated. Wait, wait, maybe it's not elimination but dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene? But that would require adjacent protons, which I'm not sure about.

Hmm. Maybe I should look up what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I recall that NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation, especially in aliphatic systems. Like in the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides via elimination. But for aromatic rings, perhaps it's used in dehydrohalogenation to form an aromatic compound with an additional double bond? Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds.

Wait a second, perhaps the bromine is in a position where elimination would form a new ring structure. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about substituent elimination. Let me think: 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. If the bromide leaves, but what comes in? Or perhaps it's a substitution where another group takes its place.

Alternatively, maybe the dimethylamino group is deprotonated, but how? The dimethylamino group is a strong base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton from the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, which would be an aromatic compound, but that's just benzene itself.

Wait, maybe it's about the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's more activating or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the ring forms a new double bond, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. When treated with a strong base, perhaps it undergoes elimination of HBr. But for elimination, you need a hydrogen that's adjacent to Br. So in the structure, the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has the dimethylamino group, so the only adjacent position is 6. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then elimination would occur between positions 1 and 6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in a benzene ring, double bonds are conjugated, so forming another double bond... but I'm not sure how that would change the structure.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. If a new double bond is formed, perhaps the ring becomes a larger conjugated system, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, maybe elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's not possible because benzene is fully conjugated with double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction again. NaNH2 is a strong base, and in condensed ammonia solvent, it's used for dehydrohalogenation. So perhaps it's an E2 elimination, removing Br- and a proton to form a new double bond.

Wait, but in an aromatic ring, E2 elimination would require the leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen that's antiperiplanar to it, and the base abstracts that hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents or hydrogens. So the Br is at position 1, and if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, then the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But benzene already has a double bond, so maybe the ring becomes a diene? But that's not possible because benzene is a fully conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring loses a bromide and forms a new double bond, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a new ring with a benzene ring and a double bond in a fused ring system, but that's more like naphthalene, which would require another ring to form.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the possible products. Since the reaction is elimination, perhaps the product is a diene, but that doesn't fit with benzene. Alternatively, maybe the product is a substituted benzene where the bromide has been replaced by something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but I don't think so because NaNH2 isn't typically a catalyst for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. But the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, but maybe under strong basic conditions, the dimethylamino group gets deprotonated. The dimethylamino group (NMe2) is a good proton donor, but in a strongly basic solution, perhaps it loses a proton to become a stronger base. Wait, that might not make sense because the amine is already a good base.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then attack something. But I'm not sure what the nucleophile would be in this case.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, where the bromide is replaced by something else. But the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps the NH2^- is acting as a nucleophile. So substitution: Br is replaced by NH2 group. But wait, that would form 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene, but under what conditions? I'm not sure if NaNH2 would do that. Also, the positions would matter. The starting material has Br at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2. If substitution occurs, the amino group would be at position 1, but wait, that's already taken by the Br. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but perhaps the substitution occurs at a different position. Let me think: the starting material has Br at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2. The ring is activated at positions 3,4,5,6? No, because NMe2 is a strong activating group, which directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But in this case, the Br is at position 1, which is para to position 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: in benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the substituents are at 1 and 2. So the ring would look like this: positions 1 (Br), 2 (NMe2), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, the substituents are ortho to each other. Now, when considering where a new substituent would go in electrophilic substitution, the activating group (NMe2) directs to ortho and para. The Br is deactivating and meta-directing. But since the Br is a leaving group here, perhaps the reaction is substitution.

Wait, but in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be deactivating and meta-directing. Wait, but in this case, the ring has an activating group (NMe2) which would make the ring more reactive towards electrophiles, not nucleophiles. So maybe nucleophilic substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position that's meta to the NMe2 group, leading to a ring expansion or contraction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as Ullmann or Suzuki, but those usually require a metal catalyst, which isn't mentioned here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think NaNH2 is often used for dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. But in the case of aromatic rings, perhaps it's similar. So elimination of HBr would occur, resulting in the formation of a new double bond.

So the bromine is at position 1. For elimination, the base would abstract a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is already occupied by NMe2, so the only possibility is position 6. So the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's impossible because benzene already has a fully conjugated system.

Wait, but maybe the ring undergoes a change. Perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't form a new double bond but instead leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, which is impossible because benzene is already a conjugated ring.

Wait, maybe the product is a substituted benzene with a double bond, but that would require a change in the ring structure, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine leaves, and the ring becomes a diradical or something, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple products based on the regiochemistry of the elimination. Because if the base abstracts a hydrogen from either adjacent position, but since position 2 is taken, maybe only position 6 is available. So only one possible product from elimination.

Wait, but what if the base abstracts a hydrogen that's para to the NMe2 group? Let me think: the NMe2 is at position 2. The para position would be position 5. If a hydrogen is abstracted from position 5, then elimination would form a double bond between positions 5 and 4? Or wait, elimination requires H and leaving group to be adjacent. So the leaving group is Br at position 1. So the only adjacent H is at position 2 (taken by NMe2) and position 6. So elimination can only occur if the H is at position 6.

So, when the base abstracts H from position 6, elimination of Br- occurs, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene already has a double bond there, so this might not be possible.

Wait, but benzene has three alternating double bonds. So maybe forming another double bond would create a different structure. But I'm not sure how that would look. Alternatively, perhaps the ring doesn't change, and the product is a different substitution pattern.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and the substituents at C2 and C6 (wait, no, because C6 was where the H was abstracted). Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between the carbon where the Br was (C1) and the adjacent carbon where the H was removed (C6). So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the substituents would remain at C2 and C1. But since the ring already has a double bond between C1 and C6, perhaps this doesn't change the structure, and the product is the same.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the elimination leads to a new structure, but I'm stuck on visualizing it.

Alternative approach: look for similar reactions. For example, in toluene derivatives, NaNH2 can cause elimination to form a benzene ring with a methyl group and a double bond. But in this case, the substituents are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a dimethylamino group and a new substituent.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about the formation of aniline derivatives. If the bromide is replaced by an amine group, but that would require substitution. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a new ring, but I'm not well-versed in that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that the reaction doesn't proceed as expected. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, perhaps the reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia leads to the formation of a new amine. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide ion. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that would require the amide to attack at position 1, which is adjacent to the NMe2 group, which might hinder the attack.

Wait, but considering steric effects, the NMe2 group is bulky. So substitution at position 1 would be difficult because of steric hindrance from the NMe2 at position 2.

Hmm, maybe the substitution occurs at a different position. Let me think: where else is adjacent to the NMe2 group? The NMe2 is at position 2, so the ortho positions are 1 and 3. The para position is 6. So perhaps the substitution occurs at position 6, which is para to NMe2. But the starting material already has Br at position 1, so substitution at position 6 would replace a hydrogen with NH2, forming 6-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that's a new product.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a typical nucleophile for substitution. So perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling, where the Br is replaced by a new group. But I'm not sure what the nucleophile would be here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not clear on how that would look.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible number of products. The question is asking how many possible organic products there are. The options are 4,1,2,3.

If the reaction leads to only one product, the answer would be option B (1). But if there are multiple possible sites for elimination or substitution, the number of products would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible products based on where the base abstracts the hydrogen. But earlier I thought that the only possible site is position 6, leading to only one product.

Wait, but maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen from either the ortho or para position relative to the NMe2 group. Let me see: the NMe2 is at position 2. The ortho positions are 1 and 3, and the para is position 6. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, would that lead to elimination? But the bromine is at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2 (NMe2) and position 6. So position 3 is not adjacent to bromine. So elimination would require the H to be adjacent to Br, which is only position 6 in this case.

So, perhaps only position 6 is possible for elimination, leading to only one product.

Wait, but then why is the question giving options with more than one product? Maybe I'm missing something.

Another approach: maybe the reaction doesn't involve elimination but instead involves the base abstracting a proton from the dimethylamino group, leading to some kind of isomerization. But the dimethylamino group is a strong base and might not be deprotonated under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the base abstracting a proton from the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's the same as the starting material.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let's think about the possible products again. If the reaction is elimination, the product would have a double bond. But in this case, benzene is already a fully conjugated ring, so perhaps elimination doesn't change the structure, and the product remains the same. But that's unlikely; the reaction probably does produce a product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring structure, such as a naphthalene derivative, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the bromide is removed, and the ring becomes part of a larger conjugated system. For example, elimination could form a new ring, leading to a naphthalene-like structure. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzannulation product, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of aniline derivatives, but again, I'm not certain.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to recall similar reactions. NaNH2 in ammonia is commonly used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aliphatic systems. For example, it can convert an alkyl bromide to an alkene via E2 elimination. So in this case, perhaps the same mechanism applies, leading to an elimination product where the bromide leaves, and a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6. But since benzene already has a conjugated system, this might not change the overall structure, but perhaps the substituents' positions change.

Wait, but if the elimination forms a double bond between C1 and C6, which already exist in benzene, maybe the ring just remains benzene, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but that would mean the product is 2-dimethylaminobenzene with a double bond, but I'm not sure how that looks.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, but I can't visualize that.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a new substituent. For example, the Br is at position 1, and elimination forms a double bond between C1 and C6, leading to the loss of Br and the formation of a new substituent at C6. But I'm not sure what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent at position 6, but that's already occupied by a hydrogen. I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is 2-dimethylaminobenzene with a double bond, but that's just benzene and the substituent, so perhaps the product is the same as the starting material. But that can't be right because the starting material has Br at position 1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no product is formed, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent at position 6, but I'm not sure.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options again. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3. So the number of products could be one, two, three, or four.

If the reaction leads to only one product, the answer is B. But if there are multiple sites for elimination, perhaps multiple products are formed.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has Br at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2, which is ortho. When the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (adjacent to Br), elimination occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. But since the NMe2 is at position 2, perhaps this leads to a new substituent at position 6.

Wait, but the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, but position 6 would then have a hydrogen before elimination. After elimination, the substituent would be the double bond, not a hydrogen. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new substituent, such as an amino group, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. I think the reaction leads to only one product because there's only one possible site for elimination (position 6). So the number of products is 1. So the answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethylamine (1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation (elimination reactions) in aliphatic systems. In this case, the bromine atom at position 1 is adjacent to a hydrogen atom at position 6. The base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. 

The dimethylamino group at position 2 is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group, but it does not interfere with the elimination process at position 6. Since the only possible site for elimination is position 6, the reaction produces a single product: 1,6-dimethylaminobenzene with a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Given that there is only one possible product from this reaction, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
