Okay, so I've got this question here about a transmission electron microscope and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the setup: Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like under 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of gas molecules because they interfere with the electron microscopy—like causing scattering and stuff, right?

But even after doing all that pumping, some gas particles are still there, as the mass spectrometer detected. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that's not changing. The question is, what can we say about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, what's the mean free path formula again? I remember it's something like λ = 1/(n * π * d² * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density of gas molecules, and d is the effective diameter. Or maybe it's something involving the pressure and temperature. Oh right, the mean free path can also be approximated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. Since pressure is low, λ is longer, but in this case, the pressure is already ultra-low, so λ1 is probably quite large.

But when Mike starts the electron beam, what's happening? Well, the electron beam is a high-energy beam. I wonder if it interacts with the gas molecules. Oh, maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize or get excited. Or perhaps the beam is heating the gas, but the problem says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it's a charged particle beam. Gas molecules in the vacuum chamber might get charged as well. Like, electrons could be stripping off from the gas molecules, or maybe the gas is getting ionized. So, the gas becomes partially ionized, meaning some of the gas molecules are now ions or charged particles.

If the gas molecules are charged, they might interact differently with the electron beam. But more importantly, how does this affect their movement in the vacuum? Well, charged particles in a vacuum might experience different forces. But wait, the vacuum is the sample compartment of the TEM. So when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being accelerated or influenced by the electric or magnetic fields from the beam.

Wait, but another angle: the presence of a charged electron beam could cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide. Or maybe it affects the way they move. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to be more "active"—like increasing the rate of collisions between gas molecules.

Wait, but what about electron scattering? The question says that the mean free path changes because of electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be scattering the electrons. That's why Mike observed a change in the mean free path.

Wait a second, the mean free path of the gas molecules—does the electron beam affect that? Because the mean free path of the gas molecules depends on their interactions with each other and perhaps with the electron beam.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons, which could cause them to move more, perhaps increasing the number of collisions, thereby decreasing the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Because λ is inversely proportional to the number density (n) and the collision cross-section (σ, which is πd²). If the number of collisions increases, λ decreases.

Wait, but in the scenario, the pressure is the same. Because the temperature is the same, the number density (n) should be the same. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, making them charged. Charged particles would have different behavior. For one, in a vacuum, charged particles are more likely to interact with the walls or other charged particles. But does that affect the mean free path? Or perhaps the charged particles would have a different collision rate.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls of the chamber, thus reducing their mean free path. But wait, the mean free path is the average distance between collisions with other gas molecules, not the walls. Unless the electron beam is causing gas molecules to hit the walls more often.

Wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the charged particles (if the gas becomes ionized) would have a different cross-section for collisions. For example, if the gas molecules are ions, their effective diameter might increase because they carry charge, which could lead to more frequent collisions. So the collision cross-section σ goes up, making λ = 1/(n σ) go down.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path decreases because the ionized particles have higher cross-sections for scattering, either among themselves or with the electrons.

Wait, but the problem states that the mean free path is based on electron scattering with gas molecules. So the gas molecules are causing more scattering events for the electrons, which would imply that the gas is more dense in some way, or the scattering cross-section is higher.

But wait, the mean free path λ of the gas molecules themselves. Oh! The question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. But Mike is observing that the mean free path of the gas molecules changes when the electron beam is on. How?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other. Maybe because the electrons are providing energy, so the gas molecules have higher kinetic energies, leading to more frequent collisions. But wait, higher temperature would lead to higher speeds and thus shorter mean free paths, but the temperature is the same. So that's not it.

Alternative approach: What factors affect the mean free path of gas molecules?

The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if σ increases, λ decreases, and vice versa.

When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are ionized, so their effective diameter increases. Because ions have an effective diameter that includes their charge cloud, which is larger than the neutral molecule. So σ increases, hence λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But wait, the electron beam can also cause the gas to be excited, perhaps leading to more molecular collisions. Alternatively, maybe the beam creates more charged particles, which stick to the walls, reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment, thus increasing the mean free path. But Mike's observation is that λ changes to λ2, but the problem says that the sample compartment's pressure is the same, so n shouldn't change.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, charged particles might be more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber, effectively reducing the number density. Because ions can have stronger interactions with the walls. So n would decrease, leading to a longer λ. But wait, the pressure is the same, so n should remain the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls, thereby not affecting the number density but changing the mean free path. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path is calculated based on the assumption of ideal gas behavior. If the electron beam causes the gas to become partially ionized, it's no longer an ideal gas. The mean free path equation might not hold as expected. But in this case, Mike accurately determined λ1, so it's under vacuum conditions without the beam. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas is no longer in the same state.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam provides additional energy, causing gas molecules to have a higher velocity, leading to more frequent collisions, but with the same temperature, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, because the temperature hasn't changed. The mean free path equation includes the temperature in the calculation of the collision cross-section. So if the temperature is the same, and the pressure is the same, then the mean free path λ1 = 1/(n σ) should remain the same. But in the problem, when the beam is on, λ changes. So why?

Ah, perhaps because the electron beam introduces a new factor: the gas molecules are now being scattered by the electrons. So the gas molecules' mean free path isn't just about their collisions with each other, but with the electron beam as well.

Wait, but that's a different concept. The mean free path of the gas molecules is about their own collisions. The electron beam's presence might cause additional scattering of the gas molecules, but does that affect their own mean free path? Or does it affect the electrons' mean free path?

Wait, the problem says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So he's talking about the gas molecules' mean free path. So when the electron beam is on, it affects the gas molecules' motion. Hmm.

Another angle: In the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules may acquire some charge. If the gas is ionized, the ions could be subject to the electric fields present in the electron microscope. TEMs have strong electric and magnetic fields. If the gas molecules are charged, they might be accelerated or deflected, causing them to strike the walls of the sample compartment more frequently. This would decrease the mean free path because the gas molecules are colliding with the walls more often, which are part of the chamber.

Wait, but the mean free path is the average distance between collisions with other gas molecules, not the walls. Or is it the average distance between any collision (including walls and other objects)? I think it's the former.

Wait, no: the mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. So, if the gas molecules are being scattered by the electron beam's electric field, that might not count as a collision for MFP. But perhaps the beam's presence changes how the gas molecules move, thereby affecting their collision rate with each other.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the electron beam provides a source of additional collisions. For the gas molecules, their MFP depends on how often they collide with each other. If the electron beam is causing more interactions (like ionization), perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other, thus reducing the mean free path.

Alternatively, if the electron beam is causing the gas to become more ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions increases. Because ions have a larger effective diameter due to their charge, so σ increases, leading to a lower λ.

So, if σ increases, λ = 1/(n σ) decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C says λ2 < λ1.

But wait, Mike's observation is that the mean free path changed. So what's the cause?

Another point: the presence of charged particles (ions) might cause the mean free path to decrease because the ions could interact more strongly. For example, in a plasma, the mean free path can be much shorter due to increased collision rates.

So, putting it all together: when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. The ions have a larger effective cross-section (due to their charge) compared to neutral molecules. So the collision cross-section σ increases. Since λ = 1/(n σ), λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Which means the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 1000 kV, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment (< 10^-9 Torr) to minimize gas molecule interference. He calculated the mean free path (MFP) of the remaining gas molecules as λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the MFP to λ2, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path of gas molecules is determined by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of gas molecules, and \( \sigma \) is the collision cross-section. The collision cross-section depends on factors such as the effective diameter of the molecules and their charge state. When the electron beam is turned on, it can ionize the gas molecules, increasing their effective diameter due to the charge cloud surrounding the ions. This increases the collision cross-section (\( \sigma \)), which reduces the mean free path (\( \lambda \)).

Since the pressure and temperature remain constant, the number density (\( n \)) does not change. However, the ionization of gas molecules caused by the electron beam increases the effective cross-section, leading to a decrease in the mean free path. Therefore, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

The correct conclusion is that the mean free path decreases in the presence of the electron beam due to the increased collision cross-section of ionized gas molecules.
