Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about starspots and exoplanets. Hmm, I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Wait, filling factor, right, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, not the whole star. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface, so each spot covers 20% of each hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, I suppose, because they are dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots must be 5000 K because 6000 - 1000 is 5000? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, dark spots are cooler, so they should be at lower temperatures than the surrounding photosphere. So T_spot = 5000 K.

The problem is about how this affects the star's brightness variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing dips in brightness because the spots are cooler and emit less light. This can mimic the transit method used to detect exoplanets. So the question is asking, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star does.

So, the key here is to compare the brightness change caused by the spots to that of a planet transiting the star.

Let me think about the formulas involved. The change in brightness (delta F) when a spot or planet transits is related to the area blocked and the temperature difference. For a planet, it's straightforward because it's a simple occultation. But for spots, it's more complicated because the spots are cooler than the surrounding areas.

First, the star's total flux. The flux from the star is F = sigma * Teff^4, but when a spot is present, that area contributes less flux. So the change in flux when a spot is on the visible side is F_spot = (A_spot) * sigma * T_spot^4.

Wait no, I think I need to model the star's flux without spots and with spots. The total flux without spots is F_total = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is F_total - (number of spots * area per spot * sigma T_spot^4) + (area of unspotted regions * sigma Teff^4). Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the brightness variation when the spots rotate into and out of view.

Alternatively, the change in brightness due to spots is the difference between the unspotted flux and the spotted flux as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the relative change in flux when a spot is present. The filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So each hemisphere has 20% coverage. Since the star is a sphere, the total spot area would be 2 * (0.2) * (pi Rstar^2 / 2) )? Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is 2π R², but the filling factor is per hemisphere. So each hemisphere has 20% of its surface covered. So total spots on the whole star would be 2 * 0.2 * (2π Rstar² / 2) )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The star is a sphere, so its total surface area is 4π Rstar². Each hemisphere (so 2π R²) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So each hemisphere has 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² per hemisphere. Since there are two hemispheres, total spot area is 0.8 π R²? Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is half the star, and each has 20% of its area as spots. So for each hemisphere, area is 2π R² (half of 4π R²). So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² per hemisphere. So two hemispheres would have 0.8 π R² of spots? Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is independent. So the total area of spots is 0.2 (for each hemisphere) times the area of that hemisphere. So 0.2 * 2π R² per hemisphere, multiplied by two hemispheres. Wait, but wait, is the filling factor per hemisphere meaning that each hemisphere has 20% of its surface covered, but the spots are on one hemisphere only? Wait, the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So only one hemisphere has spots, and the other is clear. So the area covered by spots is 20% of that single hemisphere. So area = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spot area is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, 0.4 π R² is (0.4 pi /4 pi) ) * 100% = 10% of the total surface. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Hmm, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Because it's only one hemisphere, the spots will be on the side facing us for half the rotation period. Wait, no. Because the star is rotating, and only one hemisphere has spots. So as the star spins, spots will come into view for half of its rotation period.

Wait, but for the brightness variation, whether spots cover 10% of the star's surface, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum change in brightness would be the difference when the spots are fully visible and when they're on the far side.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the total flux from the star is less than when they're not visible. So the brightness dip is due to the spots being less bright.

So the relative change in flux (ΔF / F) when spots are present would be equal to the area of the spots times (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, because each spot's flux is sigma T_spot^4, and the surrounding area is sigma T_eff^4.

So the change in flux is (area of spot) * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) divided by the total flux F = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

So ΔF = area_spot * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

F = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4

So ΔF/F = (area_spot) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 )

Simplify that:

ΔF/F = (area_spot / (4 pi Rstar^2 )) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) )

The (area_spot / (4 pi Rstar^2 )) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 10% or 0.1.

So ΔF/F = 0.1 * (1 - (5000^4 /6000^4 ) )

Wait, let me compute 5000^4 and 6000^4. Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = let's compute step by step.

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823. So 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So ΔF/F = 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, which is about 5.177%.

Wait, but this is the maximum change when all spots are in view. But since the spots are only on one hemisphere, their visibility depends on the star's rotation.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing, we don't. So the brightness variation would range between F0 (no spots visible) and F0 minus the spot contribution.

Wait, but in reality, as the star rotates, the spots would come into view and then go out of view. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is visible.

But let me think again: the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate into and out of view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. The brightness goes down. When the other hemisphere is in view (unspotted), brightness goes back up.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the maximum dip, which is 5.177% as calculated above.

Wait, but when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the spot area is 0.1 of the star's surface. So the brightness change is that 5.177% dip.

But for the exoplanet case, the dip is when the planet transits the star. The dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * 1, because the planet blocks the star's light, which is at Teff. So the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need to find R_planet such that (R_p / R_s )^2 = ΔF/F = 0.05177.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. Let me compute sqrt(0.05177).

Hm, 0.05177 is approximately 5.177% of 1. So what's the square root of 0.05177?

Well, 0.05 is 0.2236^2. Let me compute 0.05177:

We can approximate. Let's say x = 0.05177.

x ≈ 0.05177.

We know that 0.228^2 = 0.051984, which is a bit higher than 0.05177.

0.227^2 = 0.051529.

So 0.227^2 is 0.051529, 0.228^2 is ~0.051984.

Our x is 0.05177, which is between 0.051529 and 0.051984.

Difference between 0.05177 and 0.051529 is 0.000241. The total between 0.227 and 0.228 is 0.000455 (0.051984-0.051529=0.000455).

So 0.000241 / 0.000455 ≈ 0.53. So x is about 0.227 + 0.53*(0.001) ≈ 0.22753.

So approximately 0.2275 or 0.228. So R_planet / R_star is about 0.2275.

Wait, but wait. The question says, to produce the same amplitude in brightness variation, what should be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star.

Wait, but the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is about 5.177% dip. The planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2, which we're equating to 0.05177. So R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275. So about 0.228.

Looking at the options, none of the options are around 0.228.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, that's not matching. So did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the brightness calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the star's brightness change due to spots is the difference in flux when spots are visible. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F_unspotted - F_spot.

F_unspotted = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

F_spot = area_spot * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So delta F = F_unspotted - (F_unspotted - F_spot) ) = F_spot.

So delta F = area_spot * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the relative change is delta F / F_unspotted = (area_spot / 4 pi Rstar^2 ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4

Which is the same as (filling factor) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Wait, the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere, but only one hemisphere is spotty. So the total area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². So the area fraction is (0.4 pi R² ) / (4 pi R² ) ) = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

So the calculation is correct: delta F / F = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.4823) ≈ 0.05177 or 5.177% dip.

So for the planet, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.05177. So R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options are around that. The closest option is A) ~0.39, D) ~0.32, C) ~0.11, B) ~0.07.

Hmm. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says the star is not covered by spots. Wait, no, the first part says that the star is covered by spots, and the question is, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude as the spotted star. So I'm comparing the two brightness variations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the contribution of the spots more carefully. Maybe I should compute the effective brightness change when the star is rotating. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, the brightness variation would be a periodic modulation. But perhaps when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are visible only when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, which is 10% of the area, each spot at 5000 K.

Wait, but perhaps the brightness variation is not just a single dip. Let me think about the rotational modulation.

If the star is rotating, the spots will come into view and then go out of view. The brightness variation will be a sine-like curve as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation is the same as the transit depth for a planet.

Wait, but in the case of spots, the brightness change is a little more complicated. Because when a spot is in view, the brightness is dimmer, but when it's not, it's brighter than the mean? Or no, the unspotted areas are at Teff, so when the spotty area is visible, the star is dimmer by the amount of the spot's deficit.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas as they rotate into view. So, as the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area visible varies sinusoidally.

Wait, here's another approach. The star's brightness when the spots are visible would be F = F0 * (1 - f_spot * (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ), where f_spot is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is f_spot * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

In this case, f_spot is 0.1 (10% of the star's surface). So the amplitude is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 or 5.177% as before.

So for a planet, the transit depth is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.05177, so R_p ≈ 0.2275 R_s.

But looking at the options, that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual spot coverage. Because the star's surface is a sphere, but when viewed from Earth, the spots are on a hemisphere. So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the spot coverage fraction is 20% of the visible hemisphere. But the total surface area of the star is 4 pi R². The visible hemisphere when the star is face-on is 2 pi R². So the total spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². Now, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1, which is 10% as before.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have a ~0.227 option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum variation. When the spots are on the visible side, the star's brightness is lower by 5.177%. But when the star is in the other phase, perhaps the brightness is higher than average? No, because the spots aren't contributing when they're on the other side. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the star's average brightness is F_avg = F_unspotted. The spots contribute less flux when they are on the side we can see. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F_avg - delta F. When the spots are not visible, the flux is F_avg. So the maximum variation is a dip of 5.177%.

Wait, but for an exoplanet transit, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star. The brightness goes from F_avg to F_avg - F_blocked. So the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2.

So yeah, the two dips are the same. So R_p is about 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider the fact that the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, and the spots are only in one hemisphere. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, but the amplitude is the depth of that dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, but I think it's usually the depth.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's contribution. Because the star's total flux is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4. The spot's flux is area_spot * sigma T_spot^4.

So the change in flux is F_spot = area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

But to compute the relative change when the spots are on the visible side, the maximum dip is (F_unspotted - F_spot) / F_unspotted = [ (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ) - (0.1 * 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ) + 0.1 * sigma T_spot^4 * R^2 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are visible, the flux is F_unspotted - (0.1 * 4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's flux as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Wait, let me think again. The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is F = (4 pi R^2 - area_spot) sigma Teff^4 + area_spot sigma T_spot^4.

So the flux change is F = F0 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So, the relative change is (F - F0 ) / F0 = [ - area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / F0.

Wait, but F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4, so the change is [ area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / F0 = (area_spot / F0 ) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Which is the same as (area_spot / (4 pi R^2 )) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

So that's 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.05177.

So the dip is 5.177%, as before.

So for the planet, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.2275 R_s.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, but the rotational period causes the spots to only be visible half the time. So the average flux is F_avg = F0 - 0.5 * (delta F )

Wait, but I think the question states that the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude is the depth of the dip, which occurs when the spots are fully visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is modulated by the spot coverage as the star rotates, leading to a sinusoidal variation in brightness. The amplitude of that variation would be the maximum difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, the maximum dip is when spots are fully visible. The minimum brightness is F0 - delta F. The average brightness is F0 - 0.5 delta F, because the spots are in view for half the rotation period.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (peak-to-peak) would be delta F. But I'm not sure if the question refers to peak-to-peak or just the depth.

Wait, the question says the brightness variation has the same amplitude. Amplitude in this context usually refers to the peak-to-peak variation, but in photometric terms, it's often the depth of the dip.

Wait, but perhaps the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_s )^2, but the star's brightness variation due to spots is a sinusoidal curve with amplitude equal to the dip, so the amplitude is 0.05177.

In that case, yes, the exoplanet's transit would need to have a dip of that same amplitude, so R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area of the planet relative to the area of the star. Wait, another thought: maybe the problem considers the spot's contribution as a dip in brightness but also an increase when the spots are not visible. Wait, no, because when the spots are not visible, the star is at full brightness, but when the spots are visible, it's slightly dimmer.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the maximum dip, which is 5.177%.

So, if the planet's transit causes a dip of 5.177%, then R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's area.

Wait, let's recompute the spot's area.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun.

Filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So each hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots.

But wait, each hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2. So per hemisphere, area_spot = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

But the star has two hemispheres. Wait, no. The star's entire surface is 4 pi R^2. The problem states that only one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2, which is 10% of the total star's surface.

So that part was correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the spots as a cool region but also a bright area. No, spots are cooler, so they contribute less flux.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the star having a region that's 20% of the hemisphere's area, but when viewed from Earth, only a part of that area is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, when the star rotates, the visible area of the spotty hemisphere changes. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible varies with the rotation angle.

So the maximum fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible is when the star is viewed face-on to the spotty hemisphere. Then, the fraction is 0.2 (20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2*(2 pi R^2) ) / (4 pi R^2)) = 0.2*(2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1, as before.

But perhaps the brightness variation isn't just a simple dip when the spots are fully visible, but varies as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, but in that case, the maximum dip depth would be when the entire spot area is visible, which is the same as before, 5.177%.

So perhaps I'm correct, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to find which option when squared gives approximately 0.05177.

Looking at the options:

A) 0.39 → (0.39)^2=0.1521 → much larger than 0.05.

B) 0.07 → 0.0049 → too small.

C) 0.11 → 0.0121 → too small.

D) 0.32 → 0.1024 → still larger than 0.05.

Hmm, none of these are close to 0.05177.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's temperature. The problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots' Teff is either 5000 K or 7000 K.

Wait, but dark spots are cooler, so it's 5000 K. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the relative brightness variation in the star's light curve. The star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed with the unspotted hemisphere, the brightness is higher because that hemisphere is fully at Teff. But when viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the brightness is lower.

Wait, but the star's total flux when viewed with the unspotted hemisphere is higher than when viewed with the spotty hemisphere. So the brightness variation would be a periodic increase and decrease as the star rotates.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. When the unspotty is facing, the brightness is higher. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is viewed, and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is viewed.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / 2, perhaps? Because it's oscillating around the average.

Wait, let me think. The star's flux when viewed as the unspotty hemisphere is F0 + delta_F_unspot.

Wait, no. The unspotty hemisphere is at Teff, but the spotty one is at lower temperature.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness when viewed with the unspotty hemisphere is higher than the average. So when the star is viewed with the unspotty hemisphere (i.e., the other side is spotty), the flux is F_unspotted = F0 + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * sigma.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux from the two hemispheres.

Total flux when the star is viewed with the unspotty hemisphere:

The spotty hemisphere is on the far side, so it doesn't contribute. The near side is unspotty, so the flux is F_unspotty = (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4.

When the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the near side is spotty: F_spotty = (2 pi R^2 - area_spot ) * sigma Teff^4 + area_spot * sigma T_spot^4.

So F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The average flux would be (F_unspotty + F_spotty ) / 2 = (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) ) / 2.

= (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / 2.

The average flux F_avg is (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ) / 2 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / 2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness F_max is when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum F_min is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

F_max = F_unspotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

F_min = F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - area_spot sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min ) / 2.

Because the variation goes from F_min to F_max, so the peak-to-peak amplitude is F_max - F_min.

But in terms of relative brightness, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min ) / (F_max + F_min )? Or perhaps the peak-to-peak divided by the average flux.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min ) / 2 F_avg.

But I'm not sure. Let me compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

F_min = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 - area_spot sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

area_spot = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So F_min = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

= (2 pi - 0.4 pi ) R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

= 1.6 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

= [1.6 - 0.4 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ] pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute F_max and F_min in terms of F_avg.

F_avg is (F_max + F_min ) / 2.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me compute F_max and F_min numerically.

Compute F_max = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 )

Compute F_min = F_max - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So F_max = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 )

F_min = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) [1 - (0.4/2) (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) [ 1 - 0.2 (1 - 0.4823) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) [ 1 - 0.2 * 0.5177 ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) [1 - 0.1035 ] = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 ) * 0.8965.

So F_min = F_max * 0.8965.

Similarly, F_max is higher than the average.

Wait, but the average flux would be (F_max + F_min ) / 2.

F_avg = ( F_max + F_min ) / 2 = [ F_max + F_max * 0.8965 ] / 2 = F_max * (1 + 0.8965 ) / 2 = F_max * 1.8965 / 2 = F_max * 0.94825.

So the peak-to-peak variation is F_max - F_min = F_max (1 - 0.8965 ) = F_max * 0.1035.

The relative amplitude (A) is (F_max - F_min ) / F_avg = (0.1035 F_max ) / (0.94825 F_max ) ) = 0.1035 / 0.94825 ≈ 0.1091.

So the relative amplitude is about 10.91%.

Wait, but wait. This is the peak-to-peak amplitude, so the dip is 10.91% of the average flux. So for the exoplanet, its transit dip would be (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.1091.

So R_p = sqrt(0.1091) * R_s ≈ 0.3303 R_s.

That's approximately 0.33, which is option D: ~0.32.

Wait, that's one of the options. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

So where did I go wrong earlier? Earlier, I was computing the dip when the spots are visible, but perhaps the question considers the peak-to-peak variation, which is twice the dip I calculated.

Wait, no. Wait, the peak-to-peak is F_max - F_min, which is 0.1035 F_max. The average is 0.94825 F_max. So the relative amplitude is (F_max - F_min ) / F_avg = 0.1091.

So the dip is 10.91% of the average. So the planet's transit would need to cause a dip of 10.91%, which would require (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.1091 → R_p ≈ 0.33 R_s.

Which is option D: ~0.32.

Ah, so that's the correct approach. I think I missed considering that the star's brightness varies between higher and lower values, leading to a peak-to-peak amplitude that's larger than the dip when spots are visible.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots:
     - Cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%.
     - Temperature difference: \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation arises due to the rotational modulation of the spotted hemisphere.
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the star's brightness decreases because the spots are cooler.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the star's surface.

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the star's brightness variation caused by the spots, the exoplanet's radius must be determined such that this dip equals the observed amplitude.

---

### Analysis:
1. **Spot Area**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spotty hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, so the area covered by spots in one hemisphere is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f_{\text{spot}} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{spot}}}{\text{Total Area}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1
     \]

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The relative change in brightness when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F = f_{\text{spot}} \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting \( f_{\text{spot}} = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \Delta F / F = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F / F = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.4823) = 0.1 \times 0.5177 = 0.05177
     \]
   - The brightness dip is approximately \( 5.177\% \).

3. **Peak-to-Peak Amplitude**:
   - The observed brightness variation includes both the dip (when the spotty hemisphere is visible) and the rise (when the unspotty hemisphere is visible).
   - The peak-to-peak amplitude is approximately \( 10.91\% \) of the average brightness.

4. **Exoplanet Radius**:
   - For the exoplanet transit, the dip in brightness is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \text{Amplitude}
     \]
   - Substituting the peak-to-peak amplitude \( 0.1091 \):
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1091} \approx 0.33
     \]

---

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.33 \). This matches option **D**.
