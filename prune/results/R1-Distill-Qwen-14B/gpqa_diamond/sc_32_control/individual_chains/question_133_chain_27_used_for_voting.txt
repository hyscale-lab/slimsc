Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from chemistry class. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts, so they'll dissociate in water. 

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? But wait, I also remember that in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. The given Ka values are for H3PO4. Ka1 is the first dissociation, Ka2 the second, and Ka3 the third.

The problem gives me the masses of both salts. I think I need to calculate the moles of each. Then, figure out how they dissociate and contribute to the concentration of PO4^3-.

First, let me calculate moles for each compound. 

For KH2PO4:
Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.
Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Wait, but the formula of Na2HPO4·2H2O. So each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion. When it dissociates, it would be Na+ and HPO4^2-.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Hmm, so in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But how do they relate to each other? I think this is a buffer solution because we have two different phosphate species. Buffer solutions can be analyzed using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Which Ka value should I use? Since H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- and HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3-, but in this case, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the relevant equilibrium is between these two: H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka for this step is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. But wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch uses pKa, so pKa2 would be log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, that's not directly part of the buffer. So I'm a bit confused. Because PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, some of the HPO4^2- might deprotonate further to PO4^3-? But given the pH of the solution, how much would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is that the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2-, so we can ignore it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.

So perhaps I should consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

The Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the third dissociation is much less significant.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

But how can I find that? Well, in solution, the concentration of H+ is determined by the buffer solution. Once I know the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH of the buffer using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, then calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 expression.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.
2. Determine the pH of the solution using the buffer equation.
3. Use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- via the third dissociation.

Step 1: Moles of each ion.

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
So, moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007337 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O
So, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.
Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005611 mol.

Total volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

Concentrations:
[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028055 M

Step 2: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch to find pH.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])
pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207 (since 1e-7 is 1e-7, 6.2e-8 is about 7.207)
So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028055 / 0.036685)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.028055 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

Step 3: Now, find [PO4^3-].

The dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

But [H+] can be found from pH: [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.25e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / 8.25e-8

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Divide by 8.25e-8: (5.05e-14) / (8.25e-8) ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take into account the exact concentrations and the exact value of [H+].

Wait, but is there any other factor? Like the fact that some of the HPO4^2- may come from the dissociation of H2PO4^-? Hmm, but since we have a buffer, the concentration is determined by the ratio of the two, so the pH is fixed. 

Wait, but why did I use the pH from the buffer solution for the calculation of [PO4^3-]? Because the solution's pH affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the solution more accurately, considering all possible equilibria. But that might complicate things.

Wait, but another approach is to realize that the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, and it's a small value because Ka3 is very small.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, so we can approximate it.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the buffer's pH is about 7.093, so the H+ concentration is about 8.25e-8. Then, using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = ( [PO4^3-][H+] ) / [HPO4^2- ]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028055 M (but since the solution volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.028055 M? Wait, no, because the solution is 0.2 L, the concentration we used was 0.028055 M. So it's correct.)

[H+] = 8.25e-8 M.

Thus,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / 8.25e-8

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.25e-8.

So 5.05e-14 / 8.25e-8 = approximately (5.05 / 8.25) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.25 is about 0.612. So 0.612e-6 = 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

5.05e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.05 / 8.25) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.25: Let me compute that. 8.25 × 0.612 is 5.05, because 8 *0.6=4.8, 0.25 *0.6=0.15, so 4.95. Hmm, perhaps closer to 0.612.

So 0.612e-6 is 6.12e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm, 6.12e-7 is closest to option A (6.24e-7) but wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

I think I miscalculated the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Wait, the moles of KH2PO4 is 1g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005611 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028055 M.

Ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028055 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately?

Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.765) is around -0.114 (since 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.765). So correct.

pH = 7.207 -0.114 ≈7.093.

[H+] = 10^-7.093.

Compute 10^-7.093: 10^(-7) is 1e-7. 0.093 is the exponent beyond that.

10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.825 (since 10^0.093 is approx 1.23, so inverse is 0.813. Hmm, maybe more precise.

Wait, 10^(-0.093) = 1/(10^0.093). Let me compute 0.093 in exponents.

0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 *2.3026 ≈ 0.214.

e^0.214 ≈ 1.238.

So 10^0.093 ≈ 1.238, so 1/1.238 ≈ 0.807.

Thus, [H+] = 8.07e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / (8.07e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.05e-14 /8.07e-8 ≈ approx (5.05 /8.07 ) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.07 ≈ 0.626.

So 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, let me compute 5.05e-14 / 8.07e-8.

That's (5.05 /8.07) * (1e-14 / 1e-8) = (0.626) * 1e-6 = 6.26e-7.

So the answer should be approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, another thought: the buffer calculation might not account for activity coefficients, but in a problem like this, we can ignore that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of PO4^3- comes from both the dissociation of HPO4^2- and any possible sources from H2PO4^-? But no, because H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. H2PO4^- can't directly form PO4^3- without going through HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when H2PO4^- donates a proton, it becomes HPO4^2-, which can then donate another to become PO4^3-. So from the HPO4^2-.

So the [PO4^3-] is only from the second dissociation.

So my calculation should be correct.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 6.26e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is A.

But wait, perhaps I should recheck the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation because the initial pH might be a bit different.

Wait, the pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = 7.207? Let me compute 6.2e-8 more precisely.

Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 ×10^-8. The pKa is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076. Wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So the correct pKa2 is 7.207.

Yes, that's correct.

So the pH is 7.093.

Wait, but when calculating [H+], 10^-7.093 = ?

Wait, 7.093 is 7 + 0.093.

10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.812.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.812 = 8.12e-8 M.

So using this value, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / (8.12e-8) = (5.05e-14) / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Which is closer to option A (6.24e-7).

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would yield a value close to one of the options.

Another thought: maybe I should calculate the exact value for [PO4^3-] more precisely.

So let's compute numerator and denominator accurately.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = 1.8 * 0.028055 = 0.05050e-12 = 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.05 /8.12 ) * 1e-6.

5.05 /8.12 = approx 0.622.

So 0.622e-6 =6.22e-7 M.

Which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

So the answer should be A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. The solution forms a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the relevant equilibrium for the third dissociation being:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻.**  
  Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻, and 2H₂O.**  
  Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005611 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \).

- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007337 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}\).
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005611 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028055 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant equilibrium constant is \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so:

\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.028055}{0.036685}\right)
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.028055}{0.036685} \approx 0.765\), and \(\log(0.765) \approx -0.114\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.114 \approx 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\) using \( K_a3 \)
The third dissociation is:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[PO₄³⁻][H⁺]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]

Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]

From the pH, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting values:

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028055)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028055) \approx 5.05 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Then, divide by \( 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \):

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( [PO₄³⁻] \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \) is closest to option **A) \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

Answer: A
