Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, right? The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think this is a fundamental symmetry in relativity. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. That means any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, right, because Poincare is the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Well, the Standard Model itself is Poincare invariant, so I believe SMEFT, being an effective theory built from SM, must also respect Poincare. But wait, the question is about operators. Do higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT necessarily have to be Poincare invariant? Hmm, wait, operators are built from fields that transform under Poincare, but perhaps the operators themselves should be scalars under Poincare as well. Like, they must be Poincare scalars, because any term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So if an operator isn't a Poincare scalar, it wouldn't be part of the Lagrangian. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also a must.

Wait, but wait. The options given are 1,2,4. Let me think again. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a scalar under these symmetries.

So Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So why the question includes both? Because perhaps the question is about which symmetries the operators must respect, regardless of whether they're part of a larger symmetry.

Wait, but all operators in the SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, which must be a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare symmetry includes translations, which relate to momentum conservation. If an operator isn't translationally invariant, it wouldn't make sense in the Lagrangian. So yes, operators must respect Poincare.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps Poincare is included in being a scalar, so 2 is a must. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Poincare includes Lorentz and translates, but maybe in SMEFT, operators are built from SM fields, which are already Poincare invariant. So operators would respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimensional terms in the Lagrangian, so they must form a Poincare invariant Lagrangian. Therefore, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Moving on. CP symmetry (option 3). I remember that the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry, but some of its interactions do. Wait, no, the SM does have some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't require CP symmetry either. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (option 4). I know that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Every operator must respect CPT because the theory must respect it. So all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. Because if the theory doesn't respect CPT, that would lead to serious issues, like non-unitarity or other inconsistencies. So 4 is definitely a must.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, what about Poincare? Because the options are 1,2,4 as option C, and 1,3,4 as option D. So the correct ones are 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait again. Does SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because the Standard Model itself is Poincare invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM. So yes, SMEFT must respect Poincare. So operator must be Poincare scalars.

But wait, another thought: Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. So if an operator is a Poincare scalar, it is automatically a Lorentz scalar. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, perhaps you have to pick both 1 and 2 because they're both required. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

So the options are:

A) 1,2 → no, because CPT is also needed.

B) 3,4 → no, because 3 is not needed.

C) 1,2,4 → yes.

D) 1,3,4 → no, because 3 is not needed.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries to maintain the consistency and validity of the theory. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in relativity and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, ensuring Lorentz invariance.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures the theory remains consistent with the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators. The Standard Model itself does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT does not impose this symmetry on its operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry to ensure the theory remains unitary and free from inconsistencies.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
