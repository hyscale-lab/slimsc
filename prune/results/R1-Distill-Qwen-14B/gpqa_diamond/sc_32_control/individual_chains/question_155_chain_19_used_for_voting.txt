Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Okay, let's see. The problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is important because the state is expressed in this basis.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this state is |ψ⟩, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator A is given by the square root of the expectation of A squared minus the square of the expectation of A. So ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²).

Wait, but wait. Since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty won't be zero. So I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

First, let me write down the matrix for P_z. Oh right, P_z is given as:

[ ħ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0 -ħ ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix here. That makes things a bit easier because calculating the expectation value might be straightforward.

The state |ψ⟩ is a column vector: [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T. Let's denote this as |ψ⟩ = [a; b; c], where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be a*P_z[0,0] + b*P_z[1,1] + c*P_z[2,2].

Wait, wait, no. Because when you apply P_z to each component. Let's compute it step by step.

|ψ⟩ is a column vector, so to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I can separate the components.

So, the first term is a * P_z[0,0] * a*, since the first component of P_z |ψ⟩ is a* P_z[0,0], and then you take the inner product with ⟨ψ|. Similarly for the others.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The matrix P_z is diagonal, so when you multiply P_z with |ψ⟩, you just multiply each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, P_z |ψ⟩ = [ ħ*a, 0*b, (-ħ)*c ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [a*, b*, c*] with [ ħ a, 0, -ħ c ].

So, it's (a*) (ħ a) + (b*) (0) + (c*) (-ħ c).

Since a and c are real numbers here, their complex conjugates are the same. So, this becomes ħ a² + 0 + (-ħ c²) = ħ (a² - c²).

Plugging in a = -1/2 and c = -1/2:

a² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly c² is 1/4.

So, (a² - c²) is 1/4 - 1/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² would be the square of each diagonal element. So, the diagonal elements are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So, P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ (ħ² a), 0, (ħ² c) ]^T.

Then, ⟨P_z²⟩ is a^2 ħ² + c^2 ħ², since the middle term is zero.

So, that's ħ² (a² + c²). Let me compute a² and c².

a is -1/2, so a² is 1/4. Same with c. So, a² + c² = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ² * (1/2) = (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches this result. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the initial steps.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's make sure that this is a normalized vector. The sum of squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating: ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4 + (1/2) + 1/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So, the expectation values I computed are correct.

Another way to think: since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is a weighted sum of its eigenvalues. The weights are the square of the amplitudes in each eigenstate.

So, the state is expressed as a combination of the P_z eigenstates. The first component is |+,z⟩, the second is |0,z⟩, the third is |-,z⟩. So, the probabilities for each are a², b², c² respectively.

So, the average value ⟨P_z⟩ is (a²) * (+ħ) + (c²) * (-ħ). So, ( (1/4) * ħ ) + ( (1/4) * (-ħ) ) = 0. Which matches.

⟨P_z²⟩ is (a²)(ħ²) + (c²)(ħ²) )= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So yes, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So, the answer is B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as the column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \hbar (-1/2)^2 + 0 (1/\sqrt{2})^2 + (-\hbar) (-1/2)^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar (1/4) + 0 + (-\hbar)(1/4) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \hbar^2 (-1/2)^2 + 0 (1/\sqrt{2})^2 + \hbar^2 (-1/2)^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 (1/4) + 0 + \hbar^2 (1/4) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$**

Answer: B
