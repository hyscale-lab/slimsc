Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and molarities are given for each. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and possibly a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released or absorbed when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, in this case, there are three solutions being mixed. That complicates things a bit.

First, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because when you mix them, some reactions will occur, and I need to find out which reactions happen and how much.

Let me list out the given information:

- HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

- H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- ions will be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So, let's calculate the total H+ and OH- available.

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + H2SO4's H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2's OH- = 0.2 moles.

When an acid and base react, the H+ and OH- combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat, typically around 57 kJ per mole (but I might need to check the exact value used here).

So the next step is to find out which is in excess. Let's see, the moles of H+ are 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left unreacted.

So the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and the excess H+ comes from where? Let's think.

HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. H2SO4 as a strong acid is also fully dissociated, but it's diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+. So for 0.09 moles of H2SO4, that's 0.18 moles of H+. So the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

But wait, when the OH- is neutralizing the H+, it will first react with H+ from HCl, perhaps? Or does it not matter? Well, because the H+ is all available, the source doesn't matter. So the neutralization will proceed until either the H+ or OH- is used up.

So 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+. So the total H+ after reaction is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. That's the excess H+.

But wait, the initial H+ was 0.28, which comes from HCl (0.1) and H2SO4 (0.18). So after neutralization with OH- (0.2), the remaining H+ is 0.08. So some H+ remains, but all OH- is consumed.

So the total enthalpy change comes from the neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+ with OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's dissociated completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole. But wait, I think the value is about 57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, some textbooks use 57 kJ per mole for the neutralization enthalpy (usually, the standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O).

So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option D is -16 kJ, which is about 3.8 times 4.2 (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ). Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in kcal.

Wait, looking again at the options, some are in kcal, others in kJ. So the correct unit is crucial.

Wait, the question says 'Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization' but doesn't specify the units. The options have both units, so perhaps I need to compute in one and match.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole, which is approximately -13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 /4.184 ≈13.6 kcal). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72).

Wait, but let me compute that accurately.

57 kJ per mole is equal to 57,000 J. To convert kJ to kcal, since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 57 kJ is approximately 57 /4.184 ≈13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.6 = 2.72 kcal, but negative because it's exothermic. So -2.72 kcal is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is more involved. Because some of the acid is strong and some is not? No, HCl and H2SO4 are both strong acids, so they fully dissociate. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it fully dissociates as well.

So the reaction is between H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2). So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Here, OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles × (ΔH per mole of H2O).

Assuming that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole (of H2O), so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options: option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is taken as -57 kcal/mol. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 57 kcal would be way too large. Let me think.

Wait, no, 57 kJ is correct. So if the question expects the answer in kcal, then 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider the neutralization of each acid separately. But wait, when mixing, the OH- will react with any H+ available, regardless of the source.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the amount of H+ contributed by each acid and see how they react with the OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 *2 = 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

So OH- reacts with H+ in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 moles OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ.

But since the reaction is exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ. So that would be option D? But option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recheck:

HCl: 500 mL × 0.2 M = 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL ×0.3 = 0.3 ×0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL ×0.5 M = 0.2 L ×0.5 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct. So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 H+ and OH- react, neutralizing each other. Then, the enthalpy is 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close to that but not the same.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is different. Maybe the value given is 56.9 kJ/mol, which would make 0.2 ×56.9 = 11.38, approximately 11.4 kJ. So probably the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, but none of the options is exactly that. Wait, let me look again.

The options:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → that's about -47.8 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → about -15.8 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, so option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, but my calculation gives -11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the volumes are in mL, so I should check if I converted them correctly.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the neutralization of H2SO4 is different because it's diprotic. Wait, the first H+ is fully ionized, but the second may not be, but no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ are released.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents for H+:

HCl: 0.1 mol ×1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol ×2 = 0.18 eq. → total H+ eq: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2 mol ×1 = 0.2 eq.

Because OH- has a valence of 1 (each OH- contributes 1 equivalent). So the neutralization is between equivalents.

So 0.2 eq of OH- will neutralize 0.2 eq of H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

So why is option D -16 kJ? That suggests 0.28 moles of H+ reacting, but that's not possible because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the enthalpy per mole of H2O is calculated as -57 kJ per mole, but perhaps the student is supposed to calculate all the possible reactions.

Wait, in this mixture, after the neutralization, there is excess H+ (0.08 moles), and the Ba^2+ and SO4^2- ions are in solution as well.

But I don't think that affects the enthalpy calculation because the neutralization is only between H+ and OH-.

So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options match this exactly. Let's look again at the options.

Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me recalculate:

HCl: 0.2 M ×0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L =0.09 mol. Correct.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Wait, so perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and compute the net.

Net H+ =0.28 -0.2 =0.08 mol.

But the reaction between H+ and OH- is 0.2 mol, so 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

But none of the options is -11.4 kJ except option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ, which is way higher.

Wait, maybe the question uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think. Some textbooks use approximately 56.9 kJ/mol for the enthalpy of neutralization. So 0.2 ×56.9 =11.38 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm looking at the wrong approach.

Wait another angle: perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, considering the dilution and mixing, but I think that's not the case. The problem states "enthalpy of neutralization", which typically refers to the heat released from the acid-base reaction, not from the mixing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the number of equivalents correctly.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 give 0.2 moles of OH-.

The HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+ (because it's diprotic and 0.09 *2).

So total H+ is 0.28. OH- is 0.2.

So when they react, 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- will neutralize.

So the heat is 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is D) -16.0 kJ, if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, considering all the moles involved. Or perhaps I should consider the reaction as:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O + H2O?

Wait, perhaps breaking it down into individual reactions.

Let me think about each acid reacting with the base.

HCl (strong acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (strong base). The reaction is:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 would require 0.2 moles of HCl.

But we have 0.1 moles of HCl available. So HCl is the limiting reagent here, and Ba(OH)2 would have some left.

Wait, but perhaps the HCl and Ba(OH)2 can react, and then the H2SO4 can react with the remaining OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps all the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, perhaps I should model each reaction step by step.

First, the HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2.

The balanced reaction is:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O

Moles of HCl =0.1 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 =0.1 mol.

The stoichiometry is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2.

So for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, we need 0.2 mol HCl.

But we have only 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent.

So all 0.1 mol HCl will react, producing 0.05 mol BaCl2 and 0.1 mol H2O.

The moles of Ba(OH)2 consumed are 0.05 mol (since 0.1 HCl × (1 Ba(OH)2 /2 HCl) )= 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

So after this reaction:

HCl: 0.1 -0.1=0.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.05=0.05 mol.

H2SO4 remains: 0.09 mol.

Now, the remaining OH- comes from the unreacted Ba(OH)2 and any from H2SO4? No, H2SO4 is an acid.

Wait, no. After the HCl reacts, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 mol, which provides 0.1 mol OH-.

The H2SO4, which is 0.09 mol, will donate 0.18 mol H+.

So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) will react with the H+ from H2SO4.

So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

There's 0.18 mol H+ and 0.1 mol OH-.

So 0.1 mol OH- will react with 0.1 mol H+ to form 0.1 mol H2O.

So total H2O formed is 0.1 (from HCl reaction) +0.1 (from H2SO4 reaction) =0.2 mol.

So each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ. So the total enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is option D) if the option had that, but option D is -16 kJ. So I'm still confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the enthalpy per mole of H2O. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So -2.72 kcal is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is 57 kcal, which would be incorrect because that's way larger than standard values. 57 kcal is about 57,000 kJ, which is way off.

Wait, another possible error: perhaps the question is considering the neutralization of each acid separately. Let's try that approach.

The total moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.28. The OH- is 0.2. The reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, releasing 57 kJ per mole.

So the number of moles reacting is 0.2. So enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. So the answer is not among the options except option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way the problem was set up. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, for each mole of H2SO4, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is needed. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 would require 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

But we have 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 available. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, reacting completely with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So that leaves Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09=0.01 mol, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

Now, the HCl is 0.1 mol H+.

So the OH- from the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.02 mol) will react with H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, the H2SO4 has already reacted, so only HCl provides H+.

Wait, no. The H2SO4 is a strong acid, so when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, it's neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this correctly.

Alternative approach:

1. H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2.

Reaction: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4 =0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 =0.1 mol.

The stoichiometry is 1:1. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

After this reaction:

Moles of Ba(OH)2 left =0.1 -0.09=0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

Moles of HCl =0.1 mol →0.1 mol H+.

Now, the 0.02 mol OH- will react with H+ from HCl.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+.

So total H2O produced:

0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and OH-) =0.2 mol.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

Again, same result. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, which is not one of the options except if the options are wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.4 kJ to kcal.

11.4 kJ = 11400 J.

1 kcal =4184 J.

11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option D) -16.0 kJ present? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the total H+ is 0.28, and the OH- is 0.2, but the neutralization goes to completion, so 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O, leaving 0.08 H+.

But that still gives the same 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -56.9 kJ per mole.

But 56.9 ×0.2 =11.38, which is 11.4 kJ.

So perhaps the correct option is A: -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculated the moles.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L =0.1 mol.

H2SO4:0.3 M ×0.3 L=0.09 mol.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2:0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- →0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ 0.28, OH- 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ. So the closest option in kJ is not present, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the total H+ as 0.28, but that's not possible because OH- is 0.2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and reacts with both HCl and H2SO4 in a way that produces more H2O.

Wait, for example:

Ba(OH)2 can react with H2SO4 to form BaSO4 and water, and then the remaining Ba(OH)2 can react with HCl.

Let me model it as such.

Reaction 1: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4 =0.09, Ba(OH)2=0.1.

H2SO4 is limiting, so it will react completely with 0.09 Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 H2O.

Ba(OH)2 left: 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

Reaction 2: Ba(OH)2 left (0.02 OH-) reacts with HCl.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 H+, producing 0.02 H2O.

Total H2O: 0.18 +0.02=0.2 mol.

Enthalpy: 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

Same result.

So the correct answer, according to the calculations, is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A).

But in the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, maybe the problem used a different approach, such as considering the heat released per mole of reaction considering the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid involved.

Wait, perhaps for each mole of HCl, the enthalpy is -57 kJ, and same for each H2SO4.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization is per mole of H+ from each acid. So HCl contributes 0.1 H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+, and Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, so 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

Wait, but why is option D, -16.0 kJ, present? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include the heat released from the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2, considering that H2SO4 is diprotic and can donate two H+.

Wait, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+.

So the reaction could be:

H2SO4 + 2 Ba(OH)2 → Ba2(SO4) + 4 H2O.

But that's not correct. The correct reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, it will donate both H+ in solution, but when reacting with a base, the first H+ reacts, and then the second.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

H2SO4 (strong acid) → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So the neutralization reaction is 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of OH- are consumed, producing 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, perhaps I should model the reaction in terms of equivalents.

Equivalents of H+:

HCl:0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 ×2=0.18 eq.

Total H+ eq: 0.28.

Equivalents of OH-: 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization is min(0.28, 0.2) =0.2 eq, which produces 0.2 /2 =0.1 moles of H2O? No, wait, each H+ and OH- combine to make H2O, so 1:1 ratio.

Wait, no, each H+ and OH- make one H2O. So 0.2 H+ and OH- → 0.2 H2O.

So regardless, the calculation is 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

Which brings us back to the same conclusion.

Thus, the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

But the options include D) -16.0 kJ, which is different. Maybe I should re-express 11.4 kJ as kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11400 J.

1 kcal =4184 J.

So 11400 /4184 ≈2.72 kcal.

So -11.4 kJ = -2.72 kcal.

Which is option A.

But then why is option D present? Maybe the question has a typo or expects a different approach.

Given the information, I think the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of each reactant:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is a diprotic strong acid, so it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is limiting, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) formed.  
   - Moles of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) formed = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - To convert to kcal: \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to \( -47.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far from the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to \( -15.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is also far from the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.
