Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position of the particles, none are found where x is less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this range. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. Oh, right, the probability density is the modulus squared, so (ψ)(ψ*) where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

Wait, the given ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that out. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate, ψ*, would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, |ψ|² would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - b)(a + b) = a² + b², since the cross terms (the ones with i) will cancel out.

So |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you have a complex number like c + di, the modulus squared is c² + d². So in this case, c is a/sqrt(1+x) and d is -0.5, so d squared is 0.25. So yes, |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Is that correct for the region between x=1 and x=3? Because wave functions usually are such that their probability distribution integrates to 1 over all space. But in this case, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, implying that the wave function is zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function isn't zero outside, it's defined as something else. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in a part of space where the particle can exist. But when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So does that mean the wave function is zero outside this region, and the given expression is valid between 1 and 3?

Ah, perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the problem says "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So perhaps the given wave function is only valid in that region, and elsewhere it's zero. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, but the given expression is for x between 1 and 3.

Wait, I think that's the case. Because the measurement results say that particles are only found between 1 and 3, so the wave function must be zero outside this interval. So the actual wave function is:

ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3,
and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² in the region 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. The total probability must be 1, so the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So my task is to find 'a' such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 is 1.

Earlier, I found |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25, but wait, that can't be right because if I integrate that from 1 to 3, it would include a term that's a function of x, plus a constant. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recompute |ψ|².

ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (-0.5i)
So ψ* is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)
So the product ψ * ψ* is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (-0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula (c + d)(c* + d*) where c and d are complex. Or perhaps it's better to compute it as (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), which is the complex conjugate.

So when I multiply (a - b i) (a + b i) where b is 0.5, it's a² + (b)^2. So it becomes [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So yes, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that would mean that the probability density is a function that depends on x, plus a constant. That seems a bit odd. But perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, then the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. So when we integrate this from x=1 to x=3, it must equal 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

Let me split this into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So the equation becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations, because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, when I did the integral, I have:

∫(a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 = a² * ln( (3+1)/(1+1) ) )= a² * ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Yes. And the second integral, 0.25 * ∫dx from1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So equation: a² ln(2) +0.5 =1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²= 0.5 / ln(2) ≈0.5/0.6931≈0.7213.

a= sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85, so the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you compute |ψ|², it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, which is 0.25. So the integral is correct as I did earlier.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes wave functions have to be normalized. But in this case, the problem says that all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, meaning the wave function is zero outside that region. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, hence the normalization is done over that interval.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculations are correct, and the answer is B, 0.85.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this range. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Simplify to solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
