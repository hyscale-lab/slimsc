Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And when they say the iron atoms are "excited" in a specific energy level, that must refer to their energy states.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what "twice as excited" means. Oh, right, I think in the context of atomic energy levels, the excitation refers to the population of a higher energy state. So maybe the number of atoms in that specific excited state is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. Oh, but how is this related to temperature?

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that's actually the same value as k (Boltzmann constant) multiplied by a certain temperature. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, right? So if the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, then maybe that's the key here.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's exactly k. So ΔE = k*T, where T is the temperature. So if the energy difference is known, then the temperature is ΔE / k. But wait, the question is about the temperatures of the two stars.

Wait, no, the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's a specific energy level transition. So both stars have the same ΔE, but the excitation levels are different. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something here.

Oh wait, no. The energy difference between the two considered energy levels is the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron atoms. So the energy gap is fixed. So the excitation depends on the temperature because of the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. Since the question is about the same transition, E2-E1 is the same for both stars. So the ratio of the populations should be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, but in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's denote the population in star_1 as N1 and in star_2 as N2. So N1 = 2 * N2.

Hmm. Wait, but the ratio N1/N2 would be equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ), assuming that the lower state is the same and other factors (like statistical weights) are the same, so they cancel out. So N1/N2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, let me check that. The population ratio is N1/N2 = [ (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Boltzmann distribution is N_i = (g_i) exp( - E_i/(k T) ). So the ratio N_upper / N_lower is (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ).

But in this case, perhaps N1 is the population in the excited state for star_1, and N2 for star_2. So the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( [ (E_upper - E_lower) ( 1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1) ) ] )?

Wait, maybe I should model this more carefully.

Let me denote the lower energy level as E1 and the upper as E2. So ΔE = E2 - E1. The population of the upper level in star 1 is N1 and in star 2 is N2. So the ratio is N1/N2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

The g2/g1 terms are the same for both, so they cancel out. So N1/N2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But the problem states that N1 is twice N2. So N1/N2 = 2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, wait. Wait, no, because the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think I need to be careful about the upper and lower levels. Let me think: when an atom is excited, it's in a higher energy state. So the excited state is the upper level E2. So if star_1 has more population in E2, meaning N1 (E2 in star_1) is higher.

So, N1/N2 = 2.

Putting it into the equation:

2 = exp( (ΔE / k ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait a second, because the Boltzmann constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, but wait, no, because in this case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J which is exactly the same as k. So ΔE = k * T would imply that T is 1 K, but that can't be right because stars have much higher temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The energy difference ΔE is E2-E1 = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T would imply that T is 1 K. But that doesn't make sense for a star. So perhaps the ratio is different.

Wait, no, the way we set the equation is correct. Let's proceed. So substitute ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * T, where k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So T would be 1 K. But that can't be right because the photosphere of a star can't be 1 K, they're much hotter. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k*T, so T would be 1 K. But that's not possible, so perhaps it's not about the same energy level. But wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that's fixed.

So regardless, let's proceed with the equation.

So ln(2) = [ (ΔE) / k ] * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE /k = 1 K.

So substituting, ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, but the question is about T_1 and T_2. Let's rearrange 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Which is the same as ( - (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = ln(2)

So 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Wait, but this isn't directly matching any of the options. Let's see what the options are.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, so none of the options directly match ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, earlier I had ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which, because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k. So ΔE/k =1. So it's ln(2) = (1)(1/T2 -1/T1 )

Which is ln(2) = (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Bringing the terms to the same denominator:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which would be option D.

So the equation would be ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which is equal to the Boltzmann constant (k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K). This implies that ΔE = k.

The excitation of iron atoms follows the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The ratio of the populations of the excited and lower energy states is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Here, \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the populations of the excited state in star_1 and star_2, respectively. The problem states that \(N_1 = 2N_2\), so:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Rewriting the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation. For example:

- Option A (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\)) does not match the derived relationship.
- Option B (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2}\)) introduces an incorrect addition of temperatures.
- Option C (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2}\)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]
