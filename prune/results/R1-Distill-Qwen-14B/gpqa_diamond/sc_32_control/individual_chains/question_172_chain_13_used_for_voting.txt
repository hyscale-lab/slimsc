Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. The "excited" part probably refers to their energy state. So, the number of atoms in a certain excited state is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

And the question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2. The options are all different forms involving ln(2), which makes me think it's related to the Boltzmann distribution or the Saha equation maybe. 

Wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the conditions are such that we can use the Boltzmann distribution for the populations of energy levels. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy states. 

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Oh wait, but wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, I think we're comparing the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere to those in star_2's. 

Wait, but the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Or wait, does it mean that the excitation is higher? Or is the number of excited atoms twice as much? I think it's about the population ratio. So, for a specific energy level, say level 2 relative to level 1, the number of atoms in level 2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2's level 2. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in each star. Let me think. Let's suppose that in each star, the atoms are in two energy levels: ground (E1) and excited (E2), with E2 > E1. The ratio of populations would be n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

But the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, for each star, the ratio of n2 to n1 is different. Let me denote for star_1: (n2/n1)_1 = 2*(n2/n1)_2. Wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the population of a specific excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me clarify: Let’s say the specific energy level is level 2. So, in star_1, n2 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, because the way it's phrased is "twice as excited", which might imply that the ratio of n2/n1 in star_1 is twice the ratio in star_2. 

Wait, maybe I should approach it this way. For each star, the population ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. For star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But the question states that the number in the excited level (n2) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. No, wait, the question says it's twice as excited. Wait, perhaps the ratio of n2_1/n1_1 is twice the ratio of n2_2/n1_2. So,

n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)

Wait, but that might not be the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But I think the correct approach is to model the ratio between the two stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio of excited to ground state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

(n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)

Which can be written as:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the problem states that the excitation is twice as much. Let me re-express this.

Let’s denote that the population in the higher energy level is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So, n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. But I think that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps in star_1, the ratio of n2 to n1 is twice as large as in star_2. So,

(n2_1)/(n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2)/(n1_2)

Which would give:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as high as in star_2, but that would require knowing the total number of atoms, which we don't. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. That would be more likely.

So, the ratio for star 1 is (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2)

Which can be written as:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Yes, that seems correct. Now, taking the natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, let's double-check the signs. Let me see.

From the equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Adding ΔE/(k T1) to both sides and adding ΔE/(k T2) to both sides:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

But wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J, but in our equation here, it's ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2). Let me think about the actual numerical values.

Wait, but looking at the options, they all involve ln(2) equated to some function of T1 and T2. So perhaps we can write the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's define the ratio of the populations. Let me denote for star 1: (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2 ). Then, from the Boltzmann factor:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Move terms around:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but in the options, the left-hand side is ln(2), so the question is which equation correctly relates T1 and T2.

But in the options, the right-hand side is expressed as a function of T1 and T2. So, perhaps we can write:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But wait, the problem didn't give us the value of T1 and T2, but we can see that the equation has (T1 - T2) in the numerator. So, looking at the options, I see option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). 

Wait, but our equation is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps I must have made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me try another approach.

Let’s denote that the ratio for star_1 is n2_1/n1_1, and for star_2, it's n2_2/n1_2. The given is that n2_1 = 2 n2_2, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 (n2_2/n1_2). 

Wait, perhaps the question says that the number of atoms in the specific energy level (say, level 2) in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. But I think that's not exactly correct. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation level is twice as high, which I think refers to the ratio of n2/n1 being twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So,

n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2 )

So, using the Boltzmann factor:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

[ (ΔE)/(k) ) * ( T1 - T2 ) ] / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm. So,

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't have any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the energy difference is the same for both stars, but that's given.

Wait, but the given energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute (ΔE)/(k). The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So,

ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) = 1 K.

So, that simplifies things because (ΔE/k) = 1 K.

Then, substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = [ 1 K * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have here.

The question involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The analysis proceeds using the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratios of energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, which implies:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K. Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the equation provided in option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
