Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. The product here has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, making a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, cyanohydrin formation—that's when a nitrile and a hydroxyl group add across the carbonyl.

But wait, how does the reaction proceed? I think the mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, forming an intermediate which then gets protonated. So, the conditions for this would usually involve an acid catalyst. Because after the nucleophilic attack, we need to protonate the oxygen. So in the first step, reagent A must be an acid. The options for A are H3O+ (like in HCl or other strong acids) or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and HSO3^-.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A. NaCN provides the CN^- nucleophile. The A reagent is the acid catalyst. So I think A is H3O+ or maybe something else. Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+, option C is NaHSO3. But wait, what's the role of the acid here? The acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better electrophile. So for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid like H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Wait, looking at the product, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). Oh right, that's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is next to a hydroxyl group in the molecule.

Hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. If I recall correctly, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions, especially with heat and a catalyst. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they can form carboxylates which are then acidified. But wait, in this case, the second reagent is H2O and B. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you're adding an oxygen. So the product is a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions would be either H2O with HCl (acid) or something else.

Looking at the options, for B the possibilities are HCl, CH3COOH, or others. Let's think about the hydrolysis of nitriles. The typical reagents for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids are either H2O and HCl (acidic conditions) or using a base like NaOH followed by acid workup. In this problem, since B is H2O and another reagent, perhaps B is HCl as the acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B must be an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have B as HCl or CH3COOH. Let's see: option A says B is HCl, but option D has B as CH3COOH.

Wait, but what's the role of the reagent B? Let me think again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When it undergoes hydrolysis, the nitrile group (CN) becomes COOH. So under what conditions does this happen? For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the common method is to first convert the nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Another method is hydrolysis under strong acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, maybe the reagent is an acid. So for the second reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O and an acid. So reagent B would be HCl (a strong acid), which is option A's B choice or option C's B choice.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) A=H3O+, B=HCl

B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Earlier I thought H3O+ is correct for the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation), so in options A and B, A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH (a weaker acid). Since the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid would require strong acid conditions, probably HCl is used. So option A's B is HCl.

So putting it together: first reaction uses A=H3O+ (so options A or B), second reaction uses B=HCl (so option A or C). So the only option that has A=H3O+ and B=HCl is option A.

Wait, but another thought: in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Would that affect the reaction conditions? Perhaps it's a hydrolysis that doesn't require strong acid. Let me think about the mechanism.

The reaction between the nitrile and water under acidic conditions would proceed through the formation of an imidamide intermediate, which then gets protonated and hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using HCl would provide the necessary H+.

So if the second reagent is HCl, that would make sense. So option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, NaCN and H3O+ are used. Alternatively, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a catalyst in such reactions, but I think more commonly it's an acid like H2SO4 or HCl as the acid catalyst. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some reactions. Wait, the cyanohydrin formation is typically done under acidic conditions. For example, using H2SO4 as a catalyst. So in this case, the reagent A is an acid, which would be H3O+ as provided by HCl or other strong acids.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

In the second reaction, for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, the acid is usually HCl, especially if it's a direct hydrolysis. So option A's B is HCl, which would fit.

So the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's the first and second reagents.

Alternatively, another point to consider: sometimes for the cyanohydrin formation, when using NaCN, the conditions are NaCN in a solution that is acidic, like with HCl. Because NaCN is a strong base; the acid would help deprotonate the CN-.

Wait, but perhaps the reagent is a combination of HCN and an acid. No, in this case, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A. So A is the acid.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, followed by protonation of the oxygen atom. Acidic conditions are typically required for this process, as the acid facilitates the protonation step. Among the options, reagent A must be an acid, and H₃O⁺ (as provided by strong acids like HCl) is a suitable choice for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. This ensures the formation of the carboxylic acid through a mechanism involving the intermediate formation of an imidamide or related structure. Therefore, reagent B must be HCl to facilitate this transformation.

Considering the options:
- Option A specifies A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which aligns with the requirements for both reactions.
- Option B specifies B = CH₃COOH, which is a weaker acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.
- Option C specifies A = NaHSO₃, which is not suitable for the cyanohydrin formation requiring an acid catalyst.
- Option D specifies B = CH₃COOH, which, like option B, is not strong enough for the second reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl**, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
