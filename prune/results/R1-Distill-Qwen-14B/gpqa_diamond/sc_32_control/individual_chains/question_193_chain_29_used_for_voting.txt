Alright, I'm trying to tackle this astronomy question. Okay, let's read it again. So, the problem says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r?

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d ≈ 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes, meaning they appear to move more.

Wait, the formula I think is d = 1/plx. So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1/(1/d^5 ) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, no. Wait, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx =1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm. So they're asking about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density or something. Or perhaps it's the change in number as you go to a slightly larger distance.

Wait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe they're asking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be something like 5 r^4. So the rate of change would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, let me think again. Let's model it step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) = d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. Therefore, N ∝ d^5.

So as d increases, N increases with the fifth power. But the question is about the change in number per unit distance. So maybe we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to d.

If N = k * d^5, where k is some constant, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number per unit distance is increasing as d^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4, which would be the rate of change. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another second. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So when they say "changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", perhaps they're asking for dN/dr, which is the number of stars per unit distance, or the gradient.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the rate of change in the density of stars as you move to larger distances. Let's think about it another way.

If you have a certain volume of space, the number of stars depends on the distance. So if you look at a range of distances dr, the number of stars in that shell (between r and r+dr) would be N = 4πr² * (dr) * n, where n is the number density. But wait, in this problem, N isn't given as a function of volume but directly as a function of parallax. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable here.

But in the problem, N is given as proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N = k d^5, where k is a constant. So if you consider a small change in d (dr), the change in N would be dN = 5k d^4 dr. So the rate of change dN/dr = 5k d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance interval (like the rate at which stars appear as you move outward) increases as r^4. So the correct option is C, which is r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/d \) into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative \( dN/dr \). Starting with \( N = k d^5 \) (where \( k \) is a constant), taking the derivative with respect to \( d \) yields:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5k d^4.
\]

Thus, the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**.
