Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The options given are A to D, each with a different formula.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed which can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So for a classical oscillator, the max speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. This problem is relativistic, so things are different.

In relativity, the equations change because of the Lorentz factor. The energy isn't just kinetic, it's also affected by the rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, I think.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The oscillator's total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement, right? Because at the maximum displacement A, the oscillator isn't moving, so its kinetic energy is zero, but the potential energy is maximum. So the total energy E should be mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. But in relativity, the energy includes the rest mass. So maybe the total energy E is the sum: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at that point would be E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (γ-1)mc². Let me think again.

In a relativistic scenario, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So the total mechanical energy (including potential) should equal the total relativistic energy. So at maximum displacement x=A, the oscillator isn't moving, so its kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the potential energy (1/2 k A²) plus the rest energy (mc²) equals the total energy.

Wait, but wait. No, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy, but in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) plus the rest energy would be the total energy?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me step back.

In the non-relativistic case, the mechanical energy is ½ k A², which is the maximum potential energy. At equilibrium, all that energy converts to kinetic, so ½ mv² = ½ k A² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That gives option C as the non-relativistic answer, but the question is relativistic so it's probably not the right choice.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E of the oscillator isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential. Because in relativity, the energy includes the rest mass energy mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, it's not moving, so its kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is ½ k A². So the total energy E would be mc² + ½ k A².

At the equilibrium point, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. The kinetic energy K would then be E - mc² = ½ k A².

Wait, but in relativity, kinetic energy K is (γ - 1) mc². So, setting K = ½ k A², which gives:

(γ - 1) mc² = ½ k A².

We can solve for γ. γ = (½ k A²)/(mc²) + 1.

But wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write that:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, but let me make sure. Let me write the equation:

(γ - 1) mc² = ½ k A² → γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

And γ is 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as some term, say, X. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + X.

But X can be written as (k A²)/(2 mc²) → X = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + X.

Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + X)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + X)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + X)^2].

Taking reciprocal,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + X)^2 ].

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + X)^2).

Wait, but let me compute X:

X = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

1 + X = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 + X)^2 = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2.

Putting it all together,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2).

Wait, that's the expression I have.

Looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2).

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Wait, but in my equation, it's 1 - [1/(1 + X)^2], where X is (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So my v is c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + X)^2).

But looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D says 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( ... ) )

No, because my expression is sqrt(1 - ...), so A is out.

Option B: 1 - ... but in denominator, it's (1 - something), not (1 + something).

Wait, Option B is 1 - (something) inside the sqrt. Wait, let me see:

Option B) sqrt(1 - [1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2))) ] )

No, that's different.

Option D is 1 - 1/(1 + X), where X is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So D is the correct option.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in setting up the energy?

Alternative approach: Maybe the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case isn't just (1/2) k A². Because in relativity, the potential energy might behave differently. Hmm, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is still V(x) = (1/2)k x², right?

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2) k A². But in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at position x=A, it's not moving, so its energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, it's moving the fastest, so its energy is all kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, but relativity's kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, same as before. So that leads to the same expression.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D is written as sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Wait, my expression for v is c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1+X)]^2 ), where X is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, that's the same as option D.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider relativistic expressions for force, but I think the approach I took is correct.

Wait, another thought: The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated than the classical one. The usual F = -kx is modified in relativity to account for momentum and relativistic mass. But in this problem, they state that it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx, so perhaps the equation remains the same, but energy must be considered relativistically.

In that case, the potential energy is still ½ k x², but the kinetic energy must be handled with relativistic expressions.

So, when x=A, the potential energy is ½ k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So total energy is E = ½ k A² + mc².

When the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so K = E - mc² = ½ k A².

But in relativity, K is (gamma -1) mc².

So,

(gamma -1) mc² = ½ k A² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc^2).

As before.

Then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

So,

1 - v²/c^2 = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))]^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))]^2 ).

Which matches option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should simplify the expression. Let me compute the denominator.

Let me let Y = k A²/(2 m c²).

Then,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1+Y)^2 )

= c sqrt( [ (1+Y)^2 - 1 ] / (1+Y)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1+ 2Y + Y² - 1) / (1+Y)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2Y + Y²) ) / (1+Y).

But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to the problem. For instance, using the virial theorem in relativity, but I think that's more advanced and possibly unnecessary here.

Alternatively, maybe using the Lagrangian approach for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, but that's perhaps more complicated.

I think the energy approach is solid because it's a common method for finding maximum speeds, whether in classical or relativistic mechanics.

So, option D is the correct answer.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Setup**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus,  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

2. **Energy at Equilibrium**:  
   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The kinetic energy \( K \) in relativity is given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Setting \( K = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), we have:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

3. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging,  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

5. **Squaring Both Sides**:  
   Squaring the equation gives:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]

6. **Rearranging for \( v^2 \)**:  
   Inverting and rearranging,  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]

7. **Solving for \( v \)**:  
   \[
   v^2 = c^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}\right).
   \]
   Taking the square root,  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It has a \( + \) sign inside the square root, which does not match the derived expression.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator inside the fraction is \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is inconsistent with the derived expression.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.  
- **Option D**: Correct. It matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
