Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. There are stability constants provided for the different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes are probably formed as [Co(SCN)]n, where n is the number of thiocyanate ions attached.

Wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the [Co(SCN)2]^something complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^(k+), where k is the charge. Let's think about the possible complexes.

The stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So, I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+?), and so on.

Wait, but when you have multiple ions, the stability constant for the second ion would build on the first. So, for a stepwise formation, each β represents the step of adding one SCN. Alternatively, sometimes people give the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, wait, the question states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So probably each β corresponds to the step of adding another SCN- ion. So, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for adding another SCN to make [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on up to β4.

Wait, no. Alternatively, βn could be the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. For example, K1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = β1=9, K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-]) )= β2=40, and so on. So that the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product K1*K2*...*Kn.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the stability constants for the complexes are given as β1, β2, etc., so perhaps each β is the overall stability constant for the complex with that number of SCN ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc. So in that case, the overall formation constant for n=2 would be β2, but that would mean that the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 40, which is bigger than β1. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because adding another ligand should require a higher or lower K? Well, I'm not sure, maybe I should proceed.

So, the problem is about finding the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} in the solution. To find the percentage, I need to calculate the fraction of this complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

The possible species include the free Co^2+ ion, and the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}, because β4 is given. Oh wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3=63. That might be a point to note.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, so that's n=2. So I need to compute the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} relative to all the other species.

The approach I think is to use the formation constants to find the fraction of each species, then sum them up and find the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

The general approach for such problems is to consider the distribution of the metal ion among all possible complexes and the free ion. To find the fraction of each species, we can use the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

Let me consider the stepwise approach. Let’s denote [Co^2+] as [L], and [SCN^-] as [S]. The total concentration of Co is c = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] + [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] + [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = 1e-2 M.

The formation of each complex is stepwise. So, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-: β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9.

Similarly, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} from [CoSCN+] and SCN^-: β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]) )=40.

Then β3 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} from [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] and SCN^-: β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}]/([Co(SCN)_2^{2+}][SCN^-}) )=63.

And β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} from [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] and SCN^-: β4=16.

Wait, but that’s the stepwise formation constants. So each βn is for adding the nth SCN to the (n-1) complex.

Alternatively, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} would be the product of the β's up to n. For example, K1=β1=9, K2=β1β2= 9*40=360, K3=β1β2β3=9*40*63=25200, K4=β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= 403200.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Because if each β is the stepwise constant, then the overall K for the n-th complex is the product of β1 to βn.

But sometimes, the stability constants are given as the overall for each n. For example, K1 is [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-})=β1=9, K2 is [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)=β1β2=9*40=360, and so on.

Wait, yes, that's correct. Because when you form [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, you first form [CoSCN]^+ with β1, then add another SCN with β2. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is β1 * β2 = 9*40 =360.

Similarly, K for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} is β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 25200.

And K for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} is β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= 403200.

Wait, but that's a huge number. So [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} would be the most stable.

But the given β4 is 16, which is less than β3=63. So the step of adding the fourth SCN has a lower stability than the third step. Hmm.

But why does the overall K increase as n increases? Because each step's β contributes multiplicatively. So even if β4 is lower, the product up to β4 is large.

But in this problem, we're to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

To find the fraction, perhaps we can model the distribution using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The approach is to model all possible species and calculate their concentrations relative to each other.

The general method is to assume that all possible complexes exist (up to n=4, since β4 is given), and that the sum of their concentrations equals the total cobalt concentration, c = 1e-2 M.

We can express each complex's concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and the ligand concentration.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN+] = β1 * x * [S]
[Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] = β1 * β2 * x * [S]^2 = K2 * x [S]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] = β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 = K3 x [S]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4 = K4 x [S]^4

Wait, but wait. Each complex's concentration depends on the product of the previous step's complex and βn multiplied by [S]. So yes, as I wrote above.

But wait, no. Let me think again. The [CoSCN+] is β1 x [S].

Then, [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] is β2 * [CoSCN+] * [S] = β2 * β1 x [S]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] is β3 * [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] * [S] = β3 β2 β1 x [S]^3.

Same for the fourth complex.

So, the concentration of each species is:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [S]

[Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] = β1 β2 x [S]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] = β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4

But wait, what about the reverse? Because each step is a stepwise formation, the higher n complexes are built by adding SCN step by step.

So, the concentrations are in terms of x, which is [Co^2+].

The total cobalt concentration is c = x + β1 x [S] + β1 β2 x [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4.

We can factor x out: c = x (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

So, x = c / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Once we find x, we can compute each concentration.

But wait, let me compute the denominator.

Given c =1e-2 M, and [S]=0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator:

Term0: 1

Term1: β1 [S] =9 * 0.1 =0.9

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3= (9*40=360, 360*63=22680) * 0.001 =22.68

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40 = 360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=1e-4 → 362880 *1e-4 =36.288.

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Adding them up:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Thus, x = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that:

1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [S] = 9 * 1.55e-4 * 0.1.

Calculate 9 * 1.55e-4 = 1.395e-3.

Multiply by 0.1 → 1.395e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] = β1 β2 x [S]^2 = (9*40) * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 *1.55e-4 *0.01.

Wait, 360 *1.55e-4 = 0.0558, then multiply by 0.01 → 0.000558 M.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it step by step.

β1 β2 =9 *40=360.

[S]^2 =0.01.

So 360 * x *0.01.

x is 1.55e-4, so 360 *1.55e-4 = 0.0558.

Multiply by 0.01 → 0.000558 M.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me recompute the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}].

Wait, the formula is [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] = β1 * β2 * x [S]^2.

Which is 9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2.

So 9 *40 =360.

(0.1)^2 =0.01.

So 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

Multiply by x (1.55e-4) → 3.6 * 1.55e-4 = 5.58e-4 M.

Ah, okay, that's better. So [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]=5.58e-4 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] = β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3.

β1 β2 β3 =9 *40 *63 = 22680.

[S]^3 =0.1^3=0.001.

So 22680 *0.001 =22.68.

Multiply by x (1.55e-4): 22.68 * 1.55e-4 ≈ 0.003518 M.

Wait, 22.68 *1.55e-4 = (22.68 *1.55) *1e-4.

22.68 *1.55 → let's calculate:

22 *1.55 = 34.1.

0.68 *1.55 = approx 1.054.

Total ≈34.1 +1.054=35.154 → 35.154e-4 = 3.5154e-3 M.

Wait, that's 0.0035154 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4.

β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

[S]^4 = (0.1)^4=1e-4.

So 362880 *1e-4 = 36.288.

Multiply by x=1.55e-4 → 36.288 *1.55e-4.

36.288 *1.55 = ?

36 *1.55 = 55.8.

0.288 *1.55 ≈0.4464.

Total ≈55.8 +0.4464 =56.2464.

Multiply by 1e-4 →56.2464e-4 =5.62464e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}]≈5.6246e-3 M.

Now, let's list all the concentrations:

[Co^2+] = 1.55e-4 M.

[CoSCN+] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 = 1.395e-5 M? Wait, earlier calculation was 1.395e-3 *0.1 →1.395e-4.

Wait, no:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [S] =9 *1.55e-4 * 0.1 =9 * 0.000155 *0.1.

9 * 0.000155 = 0.001395.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0001395 M.

Which is 1.395e-4 M.

Wait, but earlier when I computed [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}], I found it as 5.58e-4 M. So let me list all concentrations again:

- Co^2+ : 1.55e-4 M
- CoSCN+ : 1.395e-4 M
- Co(SCN)_2^{2+} :5.58e-4 M
- Co(SCN)_3^{3+}: ~3.515e-3 M
- Co(SCN)_4^{4+}: ~5.6246e-3 M.

Wait, but let's compute each precisely.

Compute each term:

1. Co^2+ : x = 1.55e-4 M.

2. CoSCN+ : 9 * x * 0.1 →9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 = (1.395e-3) *0.1 = 1.395e-4 M.

3. Co(SCN)_2^{2+} :9*40 *x*(0.1)^2 →360 * x *0.01 →360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 →360 *0.000155 *0.01 →360 *0.00000155 →0.000558 M.

Which is 5.58e-4 M.

4. Co(SCN)_3^{3+} :9*40*63 *x*(0.1)^3 →22680 * x *0.001 →22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001 →22680 * 0.000155 *0.001 →22680 *0.000000155 →approx 3.515e-3 M.

5. Co(SCN)_4^{4+} :9*40*63*16 *x*(0.1)^4 →362880 *x *1e-4 →362880 *1.55e-4 *1e-4 →362880 * 1.55e-8 → let's compute it as 362880 *1.55e-8.

362880 *1.55 = let's see:

362880 *1.5 = 544,320.

362880 *0.05 =18,144.

Total 544,320 +18,144 =562,464.

Multiply by 1e-8 →562,464e-8 =5.62464e-3 M.

Now, the total of all concentrations should be about 1e-2 M.

Let me sum them all:

Co^2+ : 1.55e-4 →0.000155

CoSCN+ :1.395e-4 →0.0001395

Co(SCN)_2^{2+}: 5.58e-4 →0.000558

Co(SCN)_3^{3+}: 3.515e-3 →0.003515

Co(SCN)_4^{4+}:5.62464e-3 →0.00562464

Summing:

0.000155 +0.0001395 = 0.0002945

+0.000558 →0.0008525

+0.003515 →0.0043675

+0.00562464 →0.00999214 M.

Which is approximately 0.01 M, which matches c=1e-2 M. Good, so the calculations seem correct.

Now, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt species is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction is (5.58e-4)/(1e-2) = 0.0558, which is 5.58%.

Wait, but that's not matching the options given. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the concentrations. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute, I think I messed up the calculation of [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]. Because I think I used β1*β2 for the denominator, but perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The denominator is the sum of all the terms, which is correct. The x is correct, and then each [Complex] is calculated as βn * x * [S]^(n), but perhaps I made a mistake in the formation constants.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Another way to approach this is to consider that each complex's concentration is given by:

[Co^n+] = β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [S]^n.

But perhaps when considering the distribution, the correct approach is to use the relative concentrations based on the formation constants and [S].

Another way is to compute the fraction of each species as:

fraction_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [S]^n) / (1 + β1[S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + ... + β1β2...β4 [S]^4 )

So for each species, it's the product of the β's up to that species' n, multiplied by [S]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms plus 1.

In this case, the denominator is 1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4.

Which is the same denominator as before, 64.468.

So for [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}], the numerator is β1 β2 [S]^2.

Compute β1 β2 [S]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

So the fraction is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0558, or 5.58%. As I found earlier.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps my initial assumption about which β's to use is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. So, for example, β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc. If that is the case, then the calculation would be different.

If β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, then [CoSCN+] = (β1 [Co^2+][S]) / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + beta3 [S]^3 + beta4 [S]^4 )

Hmm, but that would complicate things because each βn is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

Wait, but how do the given β's compare in that case?

Wait, if β1 is [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][S])=9.

β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([Co^2+][S]^2)=40.

β3 is [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}]/([Co^2+][S]^3)=63.

β4 is [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}]/([Co^2+][S]^4)=16.

Then each complex's concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by βn [S]^n.

Which would make the fractions:

fraction_n = βn [S]^n / (sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [S]^k )

But wait, for k=0, it's 1.

So for each species:

[Co^2+] = [Co^2+] = x.

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [S].

[Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] = β2 x [S]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] = β3 x [S]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = β4 x [S]^4.

So the sum is:

x (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 ) = c = 1e-2.

So x = c / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

In this scenario, the denominator is:

1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

Let's compute each term:

β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

x= 0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004226 M.

Wait, that's 4.226e-3 M.

Wait, but earlier with stepwise β's, x was 1.55e-4. Now, it's 4.226e-3. Because the denominator is much smaller.

So now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] is β2 x [S]^2 =40 *4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2.

Calculate that:

40 *4.226e-3 =0.16904.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01 →0.16904 *0.01=0.0016904 M.

The total concentration of all species is:

x (1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016)=x *2.3646=0.01 M.

Yes, correct.

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] is [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/c = (40 x (0.1)^2 ) /0.01.

Wait, but since x is 0.01/2.3646.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]=40 x (0.1)^2 =40 * (0.01/2.3646) *0.01 =40 *0.01 *0.01 /2.3646.

Wait, let me compute this again.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] =β2 x [S]^2.

β2=40.

x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004226.

[S]^2=0.01.

So 40 *0.004226 *0.01 =40 *0.00004226 =0.0016904 M.

The fraction is 0.0016904 / 0.01 = 0.16904, or 16.904%.

Which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So in this scenario, the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but why the previous approach gave 5.58%, and this approach gives 16.9%? It depends on whether the given β's are stepwise or overall formation constants.

The question states that the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. It's not clear from the question whether these are stepwise or overall. But in the field of coordination chemistry, stability constants are usually given as overall constants for each complex. So [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} has β2=40, etc.

Thus, in this case, the correct approach is the second one, where each β is the overall K for n SCN ligands. So the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}. So if the β's are overall, then the calculation is correct, giving 16.9%, which is option D.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **SCN⁻ concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants for the complexes:
\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]
where \( n \) is the number of SCN⁻ ligands attached to Co(II).

### Distribution of Cobalt Species:
The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free ion and its complexes:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^{3+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{4+}]
\]

The concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \) and the ligand concentration \( [\text{SCN}^-] \):
\[
[\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-], \quad
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2, \quad
[\text{Co(SCN)_3}^{3+}] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3, \quad
[\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{4+}] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
c = x \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]

### Calculation:
1. **Denominator**:  
   Compute the sum:
   \[
   S = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   S = 1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.1)^2 + (63)(0.1)^3 + (16)(0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Free cobalt concentration**:  
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{c}{S} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}:**  
   Using \( \beta_2 = 40 \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \):
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (40)(4.226 \times 10^{-3})(0.01) \approx 0.0016904 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}:**  
   The fraction is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2+}]}{c} = \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \approx 0.16904
   \]
   Convert to percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.16904 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt species is approximately **16.9%**.
