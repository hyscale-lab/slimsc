Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion, which is the deprotonated form of H3PO4. So, the system here involves different phosphate species. Let me think about how these salts dissociate in solution.

First, I should calculate the moles of each salt. Then, since they're both phosphate-related, their dissociation will affect the concentration of H+ ions, which in turn affects the speciation of phosphate.

So, for KH2PO4: the formula weight is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's see, 1 divided by approximately 136 is about 0.00735 moles. Let me do the precise calculation: 1/136.09 = 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ around 0.00561 mol. Let me calculate that: 1 / 177.99 is approximately 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So the moles of HPO4^2- from this salt is 0.005613 mol.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (since it's a salt). So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.007336 mol.

Now, in solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can undergo hydrolysis. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-? Or maybe I should think in terms of the phosphate equilibria.

Wait, the phosphate ion exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given K_a values are for the successive deprotonations.

Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-: 7.5e-3
Ka2 is for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-: 6.2e-8
Ka3 is for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-: 1.8e-12

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is what we're looking for.

In this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. These will influence the pH of the solution, which in turn affects the distribution of phosphate species.

Wait, but how do these two salts interact? KH2PO4 is a weak acid (since H2PO4^- can donate a proton), and Na2HPO4 is a weak base (since HPO4^2- can accept a proton). So when they are mixed, they can buffer the solution.

I think the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. The relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79 and log(1e-8)= -8, so 0.79-8= -7.21 → pKa=7.21? Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate it correctly.

Ka is 6.2e-8. So pKa = -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2) is approximately 0.792, so log(6.2e-8)= 0.792 - 8 = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.

But wait, pKa is the negative log, so pKa = 7.208.

Now, the ratio [base]/[acid] is the moles of HPO4^2- divided by moles of H2PO4^-.

Moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol (from Na2HPO4·2H2O)
Moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol (from KH2PO4)

So the ratio is 0.005613 / 0.007336 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) → log(7.65e-1) → approximately -0.116.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.092.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So with [base]/[acid] = 0.765, log(0.765) is approximately -0.116.

So pH is about 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- depends on the pH relative to the pKa3 of HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74 (since log(1.8)=0.255, so log(1.8e-12)= -11.74 → pKa3=11.74).

Since the solution's pH is 7.092, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), that means the solution is on the acid side of the HPO4^2-/PO4^3- equilibrium.

So, most of the HPO4^2- will remain in the HPO4^2- form, and very little will deprotonate to PO4^3-.

The concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the third dissociation.

At pH 7.092, the species present would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, but some PO4^3- might form, but it's minimal.

Alternatively, using the expression for the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We can calculate [H+] from pH. pH =7.092 → [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.27e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 10^(-7.092) is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092). 10^(-7)=1e-7. 10^(-0.092) ≈ 0.827. So 8.27e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * [HPO4^2-] / (8.27e-8 )

But wait, [HPO4^2-] is the concentration from the solution. Wait, but in the solution, the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, right? So the initial concentration is 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Wait, no, because when both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, their concentrations are affected by the pH. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system more accurately. Let's think about the speciation.

The system has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

At pH 7.092, which is between pKa2 (7.208) and pKa3 (11.74). Wait, no, 7.092 is below pKa2. Because pKa2 is ~7.208. So the pH is just a bit below pKa2, which means that the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is less than 1.

But I'm trying to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all the equilibria together.

The total phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But the solution is made with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the initial amounts are:

n_H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007336 mol
n_HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005613 mol

But these will interconvert based on pH.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the third dissociation to find [PO4^3-].

Since pH is lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- will be low.

The formula [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]

Wait, but [HPO4^2-] is not the same as the initial moles because some of it may have converted to H2PO4^-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the total concentration of phosphate species.

Total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, in solution, the phosphate comes from two sources: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the initial moles are:

KH2PO4 → H2PO4^-: 0.007336 mol
Na2HPO4 → HPO4^2-: 0.005613 mol

So, the total moles of phosphate species (sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and others) is 0.007336 + 0.005613 = 0.012949 mol.

But in solution, what's the actual distribution?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the system as a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, because the pH is close to pKa2, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The initial moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol, and HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol.

But when the solution is made, these will shift based on the pH. Wait, but for a buffer solution, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is equal to 10^(pH - pKa2). Because pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

From earlier, pH is about 7.092, pKa2 is 7.208. So log(ratio) = 7.092 -7.208= -0.116.

So [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(-0.116) ≈ 0.765.

Which is the same ratio as the initial ratio of moles, which is 0.005613/0.007336 ≈ 0.765. So that makes sense because the buffer system maintains the ratio.

So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution are determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, but how do I find the concentration of PO4^3-? Because PO4^3- is from the third dissociation.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using this equation.

But to find [PO4^3-], I need to know [H+], which is known from the pH (7.092, so [H+] ≈ 8.27e-8 M), and [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but [HPO4^2-] is determined by the buffer system. Let's think about it.

From the buffer, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.765. Let me denote [H2PO4^-] as x, then [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 x.

The total concentration of H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- is (x + 0.765 x ) = 1.765 x.

But the total moles of phosphate species (H2PO4^- + HPO4^2-) is 0.012949 mol. The volume is 0.2 L, so the concentration is 0.012949 / 0.2 = 0.064745 M.

So, x + 0.765 x = 0.064745 → 1.765 x = 0.064745 → x ≈ 0.064745 / 1.765 ≈ 0.03667 M.

So [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02746 M.

Now, using the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02746 M, [H+] = 8.27e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02746) / 8.27e-8.

Let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02746 ≈ 5.06e-14.

Then, divide by 8.27e-8: 5.06e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.12e-7 M. But looking at the options:

Option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, etc.

Hmm, that's close to option A, but I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02746 M

[H+] = 8.27e-8 M.

So (1.8e-12) * (0.02746) = 1.8e-12 * 2.746e-2 = (1.8 * 2.746) * 1e-14 = approx 4.943e-14.

Then, divide by 8.27e-8:

4.943e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (4.943 / 8.27) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.597 * 1e-6 ≈ 5.97e-7 M.

So approximately 5.97e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.48e-7 and option D is 3.97e-7.

Wait, my calculation is coming to about 5.97e-7, which isn't exactly matching any option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let me recheck the earlier steps.

Let me recalculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

We had pH = 7.092, pKa2=7.208.

Ratio = 10^(pH-pKa2) = 10^(-0.116) ≈ 0.765.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 * [H2PO4^-].

Total concentration of H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- is (1 + 0.765) * [H2PO4^-] = 1.765 [H2PO4^-] = total phosphate in solution (excluding H3PO4) which is 0.064745 M.

So [H2PO4^-] is 0.064745 / 1.765 ≈ 0.03667 M. Then [HPO4^2-] is 0.02746 M.

Wait, that's correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02746 M, [H+] is 8.27e-8.

So 1.8e-12 * 0.02746 = (1.8 * 0.02746) * 1e-12 = 0.049428 * 1e-12 = 4.9428e-14.

Divide by 8.27e-8 → 4.9428e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ (4.9428 / 8.27) * 1e-6 → approx 0.597 * 1e-6 = 5.97e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 5.97e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly. Maybe I made a more precise calculation for pH.

Wait, perhaps the pH calculation was approximate. Let me recalculate it more accurately.

Given that [base] = 0.005613 mol, [acid] = 0.007336 mol.

Ratio [base]/[acid] = 0.005613 / 0.007336 = let's compute this exactly.

0.005613 / 0.007336 = (5.613 / 7.336) = approximately 0.765.

Wait, 5.613 divided by 7.336.

Let me compute 5.613 /7.336:

7.336 * 0.765 = ?

7.336 * 0.7 = 5.1352

7.336 * 0.06 = 0.44016 → total 5.57536.

7.336 *0.005=0.03668 → 5.612. So 0.765 gives 5.61196, which is very close to 5.613. So, the ratio is approximately 0.765.

So log(0.765)= ?

Log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + log(1e-1) → log(7.65) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

But perhaps a more precise calculation of log(0.765) would be better.

Using a calculator, log(0.765) is approximately -0.1157.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.1157) = 7.0923.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0923) = ?

Let me calculate more accurately. 10^(-7.0923) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0923).

10^(-0.0923) is about 0.827.

Wait, 10^(-0.09)= about 0.8123, because log(8.123)=0.909, so 10^(-0.09)= 0.8123.

Wait, more accurately, 0.0923. Let me compute 10^(-0.0923).

Using natural logarithm approximation:

ln(10^(-0.0923))= -0.0923 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0923 *2.3026 ≈ -0.2125.

So e^(-0.2125) ≈ 0.8087.

So 10^(-0.0923) ≈ 0.8087.

So [H+]= 1e-7 * 0.8087 ≈ 8.087e-8 M.

So [H+] is approximately 8.087e-8.

Now, let's recalculate [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02746) / 8.087e-8.

Compute the numerator:

1.8e-12 *0.02746 = 5.04e-14.

Denominator:8.087e-8.

So 5.04e-14 /8.087e-8 = (5.04 /8.087) *1e-6 ≈ 0.623 *1e-6 = 6.23e-7.

Ah! Now that's 6.23e-7 M, which is option A:6.24e-7 M.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier? Because I used an approximate [H+], I think. Now, with a more accurate [H+], the result comes to about 6.23e-7, which matches option A.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-].

Let me re-calculate the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-].

Total concentration of H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- is (0.007336 + 0.005613)/0.2 = 0.012949 / 0.2 = 0.064745 M.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.765.

Let’s denote [H2PO4^-] = x, so [HPO4^2-] = 0.765x.

x + 0.765x = 0.064745 → 1.765x = 0.064745 → x = 0.064745 /1.765 ≈ 0.03667 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is 0.765 *0.03667 ≈ 0.02795 M.

Wait, precise calculation:

0.064745 / 1.765 = ?

Let me compute 1.765 * 0.03667.

1.765 * 0.03667 ≈ 0.06474.

Yes, so x is 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.765 * 0.03667 = 0.02795 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02795) / 8.087e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02795 = 5.031e-14.

Denominator: 8.087e-8.

So 5.031e-14 /8.087e-8 = (5.031 /8.087) *1e-6 ≈ 0.622 *1e-6 → 6.22e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7, matching option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of phosphate species and use the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
  This contributes 0.007336 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \).  
  This contributes 0.005613 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Total phosphate concentration
The total phosphate concentration in the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total phosphate} = \frac{0.007336 + 0.005613}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = \frac{0.012949}{0.2} \approx 0.064745 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: Buffer system and pH calculation
The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base), forming a buffer. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right),
\]  
where \( K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \) (for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄), and \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \).  

The ratio of base to acid is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} = \frac{0.005613}{0.007336} \approx 0.765.
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 4: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]  
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]  

- \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.087 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- \( [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.02795 \, \text{M} \) (calculated from the buffer system).  

Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02795)}{8.087 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.031 \times 10^{-14}}{8.087 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
