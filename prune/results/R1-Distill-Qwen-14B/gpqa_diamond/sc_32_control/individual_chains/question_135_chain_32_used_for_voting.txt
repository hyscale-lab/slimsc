Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so this looks like an interaction term between the boson X and some fermions. The lambda is probably a coupling constant, and v is maybe a vacuum expectation value or some constant term. But the key here is that X is interacting with fermions ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I'm to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, kinematical allowance is about whether the decay products can have enough energy. For a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So I need to know the masses of all possible fermions that X can interact with and see which ones are less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

From the Lagrangian, ψ_f represents which fermions? The term in the Lagrangian is similar to Yukawa coupling. The interaction is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, so it's a Yukawa interaction. That implies that X can decay into two fermions of the same type. So for each fermion that X couples to, we can get X → f f-bar.

But wait, the fermions in the interaction term would be the ones that X can decay into. So which fermions are present here? The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." the Lagrangian. So ψ_f is any fermion that X couples to.

But the options are giving specific particles. So I need to figure out which fermions have masses below 3 GeV because X is 6 GeV. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV, way below 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV, also way below.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV, much below.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. Hmm, so 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay to c c-bar.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5-5 GeV. Oh, wait, 4.5 is more than 3. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 2*m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So b is out.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, mass around 173 GeV. So not possible.
- Electron (e): mass ~0.5 MeV, negligible. So X can decay to e+ e-.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV, so 2*muon mass is ~211 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So X can decay to μ+ μ-.
- Tau (τ): mass ~1.78 GeV. So 2*m_tau is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is more than 3 GeV, but less than 6? Wait, 3.56 is more than 3, so 2m_τ = 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV is bigger than 3.56, so decay into τ τ-bar is allowed. Because 6 GeV > 3.56 GeV.

Wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so it's allowed. So τ can be produced.

So let's list possible fermions:

- u, d, s: all m < 3 GeV. So their pairs are allowed.

- c: m about 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total, which is allowed.

- τ: 1.78 GeV, so 3.56 <6 GeV, allowed.

- e and μ: way too light, allowed.

But what about the quarks? The problem is, in the Lagrangian, it's written as ψ_f. So X can interact with any fermion f as long as the coupling exists. But in reality, for a given X, it's possible that X couples only to certain fermions.

Wait, but the question is about the possible decays, regardless of the interaction terms. Wait no, the interaction is given, so the possible decays are limited to the fermions that X interacts with. But in the Lagrangian, it's written as ψ_f, which is a generic fermion field. So perhaps X can decay to any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

But in reality, the problem states that the interaction is given, but I don't have information about which specific fermions are involved. So I think the problem is more about the kinematics, not the couplings. Wait, but the question is about the allowed decays. So regardless of whether X couples to them, the kinematics must allow the decay.

Wait, but the interaction must be there for the decay to happen. So perhaps the problem is implying that X can decay into any fermion as long as the mass allows, provided the interaction exists. But I'm not sure, because in reality, the interaction term would only involve certain fermions.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lagrangian is written in such a way that X couples to all fermions. But that's not realistic because in the Standard Model, for example, the Higgs couples to fermions with Yukawa couplings, but not all fermions have the same coupling. But in this problem, perhaps the interaction is such that X can decay into any fermion that satisfies the mass condition.

Wait, but let's think again. The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So for each fermion f, you have a term coupling X to ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion f as long as the mass allows.

But the fermions that have masses less than 3 GeV (because X is 6 GeV, so 6/2=3 GeV) are:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV → allowed.
- Down (d): ~4-5 MeV → allowed.
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV → allowed.
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV → allowed since 1.5 <3 GeV.
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed.
- Top (t): way too big.
- Electron (e): allowed.
- Muon (μ): allowed.
- Tau (τ): 1.78 GeV → 2*m_τ=3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

Wait, but 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so decay into τ is allowed.

So the possible decay products are any pair of fermions where 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So all the fermion pairs in the options must have their fermion masses less than or equal to 3 GeV.

But looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the b quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b =9 GeV>6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So let's check each fermion:

c: 1.5 GeV → allowed.
s: allowed.
u: allowed.
d: allowed.
τ: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 <6 → allowed.
μ: allowed.
e: allowed.

But wait, c is 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar. So option B has c, which is allowed.

But what about tau? Its mass is ~1.78 GeV, so 2*m_tau=3.56 GeV <6, so it's allowed. So option B doesn't include b, which is good.

Option C: Includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, τ+ τ-, etc. But t is way too heavy; 2*m_t is about 346 GeV, which is way higher than X's mass. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But again, b's mass is too high, as 4.5 GeV. So D is not allowed.

Wait, wait. Let's recount. The possible fermions that can be decay products are those with mass <3 GeV.

So fermions allowed are:

up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau (because 2m_tau=3.56 GeV <6 GeV).

Wait, but tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6, so allowed.

So possible decays are:

u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but in the options, which one includes these?

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So option B includes all of the allowed fermions except for b and t. So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking at option B's decay products: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So yes, that's all allowed.

Wait, but wait. Do the quarks have to be considered in their hadronic states? Because in reality, quarks are confined, so they can't be observed as free particles. But in the context of particle decays, when considering decay modes, it's about the allowed decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which then hadronize into jets. But the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, not whether they can be observed directly. So for the purposes of this question, X can decay into any quark-antiquark pair where 2m_q ≤6 GeV.

So, in the options, the correct decay channels are all the fermion pairs except those whose masses would require more than 6 GeV.

So the correct option is B. Because it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermions have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the mass of \( X \) is sufficient. The kinematic condition for a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is:

\[
m_X \geq 2m_f,
\]

where \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Fermions with \( m_f > 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_f > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)) cannot be decay products of \( X \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
1. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
2. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
3. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
4. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.4-3.0 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
5. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5-5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0-10 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not allowed.
6. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not allowed.
7. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
8. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
9. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.

From this analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:

\[
X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^-.
\]

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
