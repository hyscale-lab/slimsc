Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think out loud.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, in this case, the matrix looks like it's a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ projectors.

Hmm, I think I should write out what this density matrix looks like in matrix form. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the Pauli matrices, right? So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in (2,2). So adding them together, each gives a diagonal matrix with 1s, so adding them would give a matrix with 2s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the diagonal becomes 1, and the off-diagonal are zero. So ρ is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2? Wait, no, the identity matrix has 1s on the diagonal, but here each term contributes 1/2. So ρ would be [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], right?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (1/2)I. That makes sense. So it's a completely mixed state, meaning it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with probability 1/2.

But the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit rusty on that. I remember that the space of density matrices is a subset of all 2x2 positive semidefinite matrices with trace 1. But how does that map geometrically?

Wait, I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector represents a pure state |ψ⟩ as a point on the unit sphere. For a qubit, the state |ψ⟩ can be written as cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, and the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle and φ the azimuthal.

But ρ here is a mixed state. How does that translate? I think the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So for ρ = (I)/2, as in this case, that would mean r·σ must be zero. So that implies r is the zero vector. Because (I + 0)/2 is just I/2.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure. The density matrix ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is indeed the same as (I)/2. Comparing to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then r must be zero. So the Bloch vector is at the origin, which in the qubit space is the completely mixed state, equidistant from |0⟩ and |1⟩, as it's their equal mixture. Yeah, that makes sense.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this corresponds to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state, which is an equal statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

To determine the geometrical position of this density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation, recall that any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this to the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the Bloch vector is at the origin in the qubit space.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to option C.
