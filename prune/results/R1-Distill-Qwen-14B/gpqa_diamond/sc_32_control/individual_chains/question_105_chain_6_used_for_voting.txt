Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and it's got a Teff of 6000 K. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by these dark spots. The spots themselves are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K or something? Wait no, the temperature difference is 1000 K, so if the star is 6000 K, the spots would be 5000 K. I think that's how it works.

The problem says that because of these spots, when we observe the star's brightness over time, it changes periodically due to the star rotating, showing the spots as it turns. This brightness variation can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So the question is, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness change, what would be the radius of that planet compared to the star's radius?

We need to find Rpl/Rstar. The options are A to D, with some numbers like 0.07, 0.11, etc.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness depends on the area of the planet compared to the area of the star. So the formula for the change in brightness (the dip in light curve) is approximately (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But wait, that's for a planet causing a transit. But in this case, the star's brightness variation is due to spots, so it's different.

Wait, the problem says that the observed variation is due to spots, but they can "closely resemble" an exoplanet. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spots do. But wait, the star with spots would have a varying brightness as spots come into view. But when the spots are on the side facing us, does that make the star appear brighter or dimmer? Oh right, spots are cooler. So when spots are facing us, more of the cooler (dimmer) parts are visible, making the star appear a bit dimmer. When the star rotates so that the spots are on the opposite side, the star appears brighter.

So the variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation is the difference in brightness when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

Wait, but the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, if instead of spots, it's a planet, what planet size would cause the same brightness change.

But wait, the problem says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?"

Wait, so normally, without any spots, a planet transiting the star would cause a dip in brightness. But in this case, the spots are causing a dip, but the question is, what size planet would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, perhaps the spots cause a variation in brightness that's similar to a planet blocking the light. So the question is, what planet's size would produce a dip of the same amplitude as the dip caused by the spots.

But wait, the spot scenario is different. The star's brightness varies because part of it is cooler, so when spots rotate into view, the total brightness decreases. But the planet would cause a dip when it blocks part of the star's light. The dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. So the dip amplitude is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But in the spot case, the dip amplitude would be the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they are not.

So first, I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then set that equal to (Rp / Rstar)^2, and solve for Rp.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the normal flux of the star when not spotted.
2. Calculate the flux when a certain area is covered by spots.
3. Compute the difference in flux (the dip) when the spots are visible.
4. Set this dip equal to the dip caused by a planet transit, which is (Rp / Rstar)^2 * Fstar.
5. Solve for Rp / Rstar.

Wait, but actually, the flux from the star when spots are present is lower. The dip is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

Alternatively, the flux from the star when the spots are on the side facing us is lower than when the spots are not visible. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible. But wait, the spots are on a hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and 20% of that hemisphere is spots. Hmm, perhaps that's more complicated than I thought.

Wait, let me think about the star. The star is a sphere, so its total surface area is 4πR². The spotted hemisphere has an area of 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spotted regions is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, that area is covered with spots, which are cooler.

So when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere facing us, the total flux is the normal flux minus the flux lost due to the spots.

So to find the dip in brightness when the spots are visible, I can compute the difference between the star's flux without any spots and the flux with the spots.

The star's flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4π R^2 / (4π D^2) ), but wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of luminosity and then how the spots affect it.

Wait, the total luminosity of the star is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The area of the spots is A_spots = 0.4 π R².

The luminosity of the spots is L_spots = A_spots * σ T_spot^4.

So the normal luminosity of the star is L = 4 π R² * σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the star's luminosity becomes L' = L - L_spots.

So the change in luminosity is ΔL = L - L' = L_spots.

The relative change in flux is ΔL / L.

Wait, but when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere facing us, the flux we receive is F = (L - L_spots) / (4π D²), and when the other hemisphere is facing, it's F = L / (4π D²).

So the maximum dip in flux is (L_spots / L) * 100%.

So (L_spots) = 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

L = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the ratio L_spots / L is (0.4 π R² σ 5000^4) / (4 π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify that:

= (0.4 * 5000^4) / (4 * 6000^4 )

= (0.1 * 5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

Wait, 0.4 /4 is 0.1.

So,

= 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4

5000 is 5/6 of 6000. So (5/6)^4.

Calculate 5/6:

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.1 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.0482253.

So approximately 4.82% dip.

Wait, but wait—that's the maximum dip when all the spots are facing us.

But the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots cover 20% of the area. But wait, I already accounted for that in the A_spots calculation (0.4 π R²), so that should be correct.

So the maximum dip in brightness is about 4.82%. So the amplitude of the light curve variation is about 4.82% of the original brightness.

But wait, when the star isn't covered by spots, the dip would be zero. But the question says, if the star wasn’t covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude.

Wait, no. The question states: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

So in other words, the observed variation due to the spots is similar to what a planet would cause. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is the same as what a planet of radius Rpl would cause.

So, the dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rpl², and the star's area is π Rstar² (wait, no: when a planet transits, it blocks a circular area of π Rpl^2, and the star's cross-section is π Rstar^2. So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the dip from the spots is 4.82% (around 0.0482), so to get the same dip amplitude, the planet's dip should be the same.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0482.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0482) ≈ 0.2196.

Wait, but that's about 0.22, and the options don't seem to have that. Let me check the options:

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these are 0.22. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor because the spot is cooler, but the way the brightness varies is different. Wait, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star, causing a dip. But the spot effect is that a cooler area comes into view, making the star appear slightly dimmer.

But in reality, when the planet is not transiting, the star is brighter than when it's transiting. Wait, no, when the planet is not transiting, the star is at maximum brightness. When the planet transits, it blocks part of the star, causing a dip.

In the case of spots, when the spotted area is visible, the brightness is lower than when it's not. So the amplitude of variation is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But perhaps I should think about it as the change in flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, let's re-calculate the dip.

The star's total flux without spots: F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) = σ Teff^4 R² / D².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F1 = F0 - (number of spots area) * σ T_spot^4.

Number of spots area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F1 = F0 - (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The dip is F0 - F1 = 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the relative dip is (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4) / (4 π R² σ (6000)^4 )

Simplify: (0.4 * 5000^4 ) / (4 * 6000^4 )

Which is (0.1 * 5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

As before, which is 0.1*(5/6)^4.

Which is about 0.0482, or 4.82%.

So the dip is 4.82% of the star's flux. So the amplitude is 0.0482, or 4.82%.

So the question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0482.

Then Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0482) ≈ 0.2196, about 0.22.

But looking at the options, none of them are close to 0.22. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

The luminosity of the star is 4π R² * σ Teff^4.

The spots' luminosity is 0.4π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So ΔL/L = (0.4π R² σ (5000)^4 ) / (4π R² σ (6000)^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

0.4 /4 = 0.1.

(5000^4) / (6000^4) = (5^4)/(6^4) * (1000^4)/(1000^4) ) = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.1 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.048225, or 4.82%.

I think that's correct.

So, the dip is about 4.82% of the star's flux.

Wait, but in the case of a planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 4.82%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0482.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0482) ≈ 0.2196, roughly 0.22.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, but that's about 0.32, which is larger than 0.22. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait a second, maybe I should be considering the area blocked during transit, but perhaps the spots are on only one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots cover a certain fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth.

Wait, no. The calculation I did before already accounted for the filling factor on the hemisphere. So the dip is 4.82%, regardless of the rotation. So the planet's dip would have to be the same, 4.82%, which requires Rp/Rstar of about 0.22.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait another thought: maybe the brightness variation due to the spots isn't a dip but a variation as the spots rotate into view. But the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Wait, but the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, so the maximum area of spots visible is 20% of the hemisphere. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, which is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2π R², which is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but wait, no. The filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere may come into view. So when it's visible, 0.4 π R² is the area of the spots that contribute to the dip.

So, the calculation I did is correct.

Hmm. So why don't the options have 0.22 as a choice? Let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, not 0.22. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the dip. Let me re-calculate the dip.

Teff is 6000 K, spot temperature is 5000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈0.48225.

Multiply by 0.1 (from 0.4/4), so 0.048225.

So dip is ~4.82%.

So planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.048225)= 0.2196, which is approximately 0.22. Not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question is about the peak-to-peak variation. Wait, no, the dip is the maximum dip. So 4.82% is the amplitude, so the planet needs to cause a dip of about 4.82%, which requires a radius ratio of ~0.22.

But since none of the options are close, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Another thought: when a star has spots, the brightness variation is not just the dip when the spots are visible but a modulation as the spots rotate. But in this question, the amplitude is probably the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the difference in flux between when the spots are on the near side and when they are on the far side. Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, they don't affect the observed flux. So the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is different. Because the star has a radius R, and when the spots are on the near side, the area blocked is the area of the spots, but perhaps that's not the case. No, the spots are on the surface, so when they're visible, the flux is less.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the flux contribution from the spots. The star's total flux is (Teff^4), and the spots contribute (T_spot^4) * their area fraction.

So the ratio is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 * (filling factor)) / Teff^4.

Wait, no, because the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. In this case, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the star is a sphere. The hemisphere is half the star, so if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, that's 10% of the entire surface area.

So the filling factor (f) is 0.2, but only for the hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But the total surface area is 4 π R². So the total filling factor is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface is spots.

So when calculating the dip, the area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, that changes things. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. I assumed that the filling factor was 20% of the hemisphere, but in terms of the entire star, it's 10% (since hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface).

So when the star is observed, the area of spots visible is 10% of the star's surface when the hemisphere is facing us. When the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are not visible.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots on that side. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered is (0.4 π R² ) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1, or 10%.

So when the star's surface is 10% covered by spots, the flux dip is:

ΔF = F0 - F_spots.

F0 is the normal flux, F_spots is the flux with spots.

F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4 π R²) / (4 π D²) ) = σ T_eff^4 R² / D².

F_spots = F0 - (0.1) * F0 * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

Because the spots are cooler and contribute less flux.

Wait, no. It's more accurate to compute the total flux as the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The flux from the unspotted area is F_unspotted = (1 - f) * F0, where f is the fractional area covered by spots.

The flux from the spots is f * F_spot, where F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

So the total flux F_total = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

But F0 is the flux per unit area of the star.

So F0 = σ T_eff^4.

F_spot = σ T_spot^4.

So F_total = [ (1 - f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * (4 π R²) / (4 π D² )

Which simplifies to [ (1 - f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * R² / D^2.

The relative flux is F_total / F0 = [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

So the dip in flux is (F0 - F_total ) / F0 = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

Which simplifies to f * [ 1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ].

So the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

In this case, f is 0.1 (10% coverage), T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

So dip = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Calculate (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = ~0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775.

So the dip is approximately 5.1775% of the star's flux.

Wait, earlier I thought the dip was about 4.82% when considering only the spots on the hemisphere. Now, considering the entire star, it's 10% coverage, leading to a dip of about 5.18%.

Wait, so which is correct? I think in this problem, since the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, the total coverage is 10% of the entire star. So f=0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, or 5.18%.

So the amplitude is ~5.18%.

So now, for a planet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, approximately 0.228, so ~0.23.

Again, none of the options match. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Maybe the spots cause a variation, but the planet's transit is a dip, but the spots' effect is a different type of variation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in brightness when the spots rotate in and out of view, causing the brightness to go up and down, leading to a peak-to-peak variation, not a single dip. But the peak-to-peak would be twice the dip, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The peak-to-peak would be when the star is at maximum brightness (no spots visible) and then when the spots are fully visible (minimum brightness). So the peak-to-peak variation is 2 * dip, where dip is the amplitude from maximum to minimum.

But in the case of the planet, the dip is a single minimum. So maybe the amplitude is dip/2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

When the star shows spots, the brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum dip is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, so the brightness drops to a minimum. When the other hemisphere is facing, the brightness is at maximum. So the peak-to-peak variation is (F_max - F_min).

F_max is the brightness when no spots are visible: F0.

F_min is when the spots are fully visible: F_min = F0 - dip.

So the peak-to-peak variation is F0 - F_min = dip.

Wait, no, peak-to-peak is F_max - F_min = dip.

Wait, no. Because F_min is less than F_max. So the variation would be dip.

The amplitude of the variation would be dip, which is the change in brightness. So for the star, the amplitude is 5.18%.

For the planet, the amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if we want the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, ~0.228.

So approximately 0.23. But the options don't have that. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots don't block the light, but the planet does. So in the spot case, the flux is lower because the spots are cooler. Whereas in the planet case, the flux is lower because the planet is blocking light.

So the dip in both cases is the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = dip. So same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the actual calculation is correct, but the options don't have the right answer. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says "the star has a radius equal to that of the Sun." So Rstar = R_sun. So when the problem says to find Rpl/Rstar, it's the same as Rpl/R_sun.

Wait, but the options are given as fractions, so that can't be the issue.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Teff is 6000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

Filling factor is 20% of a hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total area of star is 4 π R², so spots cover 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, 10% of the surface.

So perhaps f=0.1.

Thus, dip = 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1*(1 - 625/1296) = 0.1*(671/1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, or 5.1775%.

So dip is 5.1775%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) = approximately 0.2275.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question has a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation not as a dip, but as a peak-to-peak variation. So when the star is not spotted, brightness is F0. When the spots rotate into view, brightness is F0 - dip. So the variation from F0 to F0 - dip is a change of dip.

But for a planet, the variation is (Rp/Rstar)^2 dip.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the relative change in brightness differently. Wait, no, the dip is the same as the planet's effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate, and this variation can be modeled as an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as from a planet.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is a sinusoidal variation with amplitude A, and the planet's transit causes a square-wave dip with amplitude A. But in that case, perhaps the equivalent dip would be the same as the planet's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a function of time, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the area of the spots and compare it to the area blocked by a planet.

In the spot case, the area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 5.18%. So the area of the spots is 0.1 * (4 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

In the planet case, the area blocked is π Rpl².

So the dip is π Rpl² / (4 π Rstar²) ) = (Rpl/(2 Rstar))².

Wait, wait. No, the area blocked is π (Rpl)^2, and the star's area is π (Rstar)^2, so the ratio is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, so the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So for the dip to be 5.18% (0.0518):

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

Again, about 0.23.

But this isn't matching any options. So I'm thinking maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the planet transits, it blocks part of the star's light, but the star's brightness change is not just the area, but the brightness of the star's surface.

Wait, no, because the planet is a black disk, so it blocks the starlight. The star's surface brightness is uniform (which it's not, but in this approximation, yes).

So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So back to the problem. The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to take into account that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is not a continuous dip but a modulation as the spots rotate. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the minimum is when they're not. So the amplitude would be the dip compared to the average brightness. But I think that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere, so when the other hemisphere comes into view, the brightness increases again. So the average brightness is F0, and the variation is due to the presence of spots.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is 2 times the dip because the star goes from F0 - dip to F0 + something else. No, that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler, so when they're not visible, the brightness is F0, which is higher than when they are visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the brightness variations.

In the spot scenario:

The dip is when the spots are fully visible. The dip is 5.18%.

In the planet scenario:

The dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to get the same dip, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the average brightness is F0, and the variation is dip when the spots are visible, but in the planet case, the transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used 5000 K for the spots. The question says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K, so if the star is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to cause the same change in brightness as the spots, but the planet's transit is only a partial block, not the entire area.

Wait, but the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun, but when the problem says "Rpl/Rstar", maybe I'm supposed to use R_sun in the denominator, but the question says the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar is R_sun. So the planet's radius is Rpl = (Rpl/Rstar) * R_sun.

But that doesn't change the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spot coverage as 20% of the star's surface, not 10%. Because if the spot coverage is 20% of the entire star's surface, then f=0.2.

Wait, but the problem states: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Ah! Wait a minute. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, 10%.

So f=0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.051775.

But none of the options are near 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling factor. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the area covered is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

Wait, but the problem says, "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So the area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that when the star is observed, only a part of the hemisphere is visible. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but it's not all at once. So the maximum dip is when the entire 20% of the hemisphere is visible, which is 20% of 2π R², but that's 0.4 π R². So the dip is:

dip = (0.4 π R²) * ( (5000/6000)^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.4/4 * (5/6)^4 = 0.1 * 0.48225= 0.048225.

So dip is 4.8225%.

So now, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.048225) ≈ 0.2196, which is ~0.22.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the spots rotate, so the amplitude is half that value. Because when the star is half spotted, the brightness is halfway between F0 and F_min.

But the amplitude of the variation would then be dip/2.

So dip/2 = 0.048225/2 ≈ 0.02411.

So then (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.02411.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.02411) ≈ 0.1553.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the star's brightness variation from the spots is a sinusoidal function, so the amplitude is dip/2.

But that would make the amplitude 0.02411, and Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.1553, which is ~0.16. The options have option C) 0.11 and B) 0.07, but no 0.16.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the brightness variation when the spots rotate is such that the change in brightness is proportional to the change in the area of the spots visible. So when the star is rotating, the visible area of the spots changes from zero to maximum as the hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, but the brightness variation would be a function of how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates. So perhaps the maximum rate of change is when the edge of the spot is passing in front.

But I'm not sure that's relevant here, because the question is about the amplitude of the variation, not the shape.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is a dip, but for a planet, the transit is a dip as well. So the amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But the dip due to spots is 5.18% (if f=0.1), so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is different. Maybe the star's brightness variation is due to limb darkening or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio between the planet's effect and the spots' effect.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the brightness variation as follows.

The star's brightness when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f) + F0 * f * (T_spot / T_eff )^4.

So F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

So the dip is F0 - F = F0 [1 - ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

= F0 [ 1 -1 + f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ) ]

= F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

Which is the same as dip = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) F0.

Which is the same as before.

So dip / F0 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So, back to numbers.

f = 0.1; dip/F0 = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 625/1296 ) = 0.1 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.051775.

So dip is 5.1775% F0.

So for a planet, dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

Set equal:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0 = 0.051775 F0 → (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

So the answer should be approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the problem is considering the brightness variation as a function of the spot's temperature difference. Wait, what if I made a mistake in calculating the flux from the spots?

Wait, another approach: the flux from the spots is less than the flux from the rest of the star.

The total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

The flux with spots is F1 = 4π R² σ Teff^4 - A_spots σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

The dip is F0 - F1 = A_spots σ (Teff^4 - (Teff - 1000)^4 )

The relative dip is (A_spots σ (Teff^4 - (Teff - 1000)^4 )) / (4 π R² σ Teff^4 )

Simplify:

= (A_spots / (4 π R² )) * (1 - ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 )

A_spots is 0.4 π R².

So,

= (0.4 π R² / 4 π R² ) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Which is the same as before, 0.051775.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is such that it's not a simple dip but a periodic change in brightness that can be modeled as an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude is the same as that of a planet.

But without more information, I can't see another way.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps I'm miscalculating f.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 20% is visible. But when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the dip is the same as if the entire 20% of the hemisphere is covered.

Wait, but that's what I calculated earlier, leading to f=0.1, dip=5.18%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux ratio differently. Let me think.

Flux is proportional to T^4 per unit area. So the total flux without spots is F0 = T_eff^4 * 4 π R².

With spots, the flux is F1 = (Teff^4) * (4 π R² - A_spots) + (T_spot^4) * A_spots.

So,

F1 = Teff^4 * (4 π R² - A_spots) + T_spot^4 * A_spots.

The dip is F0 - F1 = [Teff^4 * A_spots - T_spot^4 * A_spots] = A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So,

dip = A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / F0.

Because F0 = Teff^4 *4 π R².

So,

dip = [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

A_spots is 0.4 π R².

So,

dip = [ 0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 π R² 6000^4 )

Simplify:

= [0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

= [0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / 6000^4

= 0.1 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is the same as before, 0.1*(1-0.48225) = 0.051775.

So same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the dip is not the maximum dip, but the amplitude is the same as when the planet transits. So the dip is the same, but the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is off due to a miscalculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 accurately.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^4 = ?

Compute step by step:

0.833333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 ≈ 0.482253.

Yes, correct.

So that part is correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the question is in error, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, and the exoplanet's radius is relative to the host star.

Wait, perhaps the exoplanet is not blocking the entire spot, but just a part, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the spots are on the star, the star's brightness is less when the spots are on the near side, but when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher than average because the cooler spots are not contributing. No, that can't be, because the spots are on the far side, so their lower brightness doesn't affect the observed flux. So the observed flux would be higher when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, that's correct. So the star's brightness varies between F0 - dip (when spots are on near side) and F0 (when spots are on far side). So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F0 - dip.

So the amplitude of variation is dip, which is 5.18%.

So the planet would need to cause a dip of 5.18% when it transits.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So f=0.2.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 *4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

So dip = (0.8 π R² ) * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / (4 π R² 6000^4 )

Wait, no.

Alternatively, dip = f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff )^4 )

So f=0.2.

dip =0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2*(1-0.48225)= 0.2*0.51775= 0.10355.

So dip is 10.355%.

Then, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355)= ~0.322.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah! So perhaps I misunderstood the filling factor as 20% of the hemisphere, but the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire hemisphere, which would be 20% of 2π R², not 20% of the entire star.

Wait, no. The problem says: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So f (fraction of star's surface covered by spots) is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

But when f=0.1, the dip is 5.18%, leading to Rp/Rstar≈0.2276.

But option D is 0.32, which would be if f=0.2 (20% of the entire star, not hemisphere).

So perhaps I'm wrong in my initial assumption of f=0.1.

If f=0.2 (20% of the entire star), then dip is 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.2*0.51775=0.10355.

Which would give Rp/Rstar= ~0.32, option D.

So perhaps the problem meant that the entire hemisphere is covered by spots at 20% filling factor. No, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

The wording is: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% of the star's total surface area on that hemisphere.

Wait, no. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of a specific region. So if one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered with spots.

So the area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So f=0.1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is not a dip but a modulation, and the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the near and far side.

But I don't see how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on the surface, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the brightness to dip, but the shape of the light curve is different. But the amplitude is still the dip.

Hmm.

In summary, I'm stuck between two possibilities: if f=0.1, Rp/Rstar≈0.2276 (which isn't an option), or if f=0.2, Rp/Rstar≈0.322 (option D).

Given that option D is present, perhaps the intended solution was to take f=0.2, considering the entire star's coverage. So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

In that case, the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.

But according to the wording, it's one hemisphere with filling factor 20%, which would make f=0.1.

But perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So I'll have to go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause a dip in brightness when they are visible. The amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the planet radius \( R_{\text{pl}} \) such that the brightness variation caused by the planet transiting the star is equal to the dip caused by the spots. The dip for a planet is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \).

---

### Analysis:
1. **Area of the Spots**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spotted hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1.
     \]

2. **Brightness Dip Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star without spots is proportional to \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - The flux from the spots is proportional to \( T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The relative brightness dip is:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = f \left( 1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.1 \left( 1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Compute \( \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225 \):
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \times 0.51775 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - The dip is approximately \( 5.18\% \) of the star's brightness.

3. **Planet Radius for Same Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \).
   - Set this equal to the dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options.
   - If the filling factor were interpreted as 20% of the entire star (not just the hemisphere), the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots would be \( f = 0.2 \). Recomputing the dip:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 = 0.10355.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322.
     \]
   - This matches option **D (~0.32)**.

---

### Conclusion:
The discrepancy arises from the interpretation of the filling factor. If the filling factor is taken as 20% of the entire star (rather than the hemisphere), the closest match to the calculated value is **D (~0.32)**.

**Answer: D**
