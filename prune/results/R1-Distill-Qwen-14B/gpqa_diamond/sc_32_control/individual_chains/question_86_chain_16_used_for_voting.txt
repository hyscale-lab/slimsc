Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the products are for each reaction. Reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl..., and reaction B uses BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... Wait, no, let me correct. The products are each (R) and (S) respectively. So each reaction leads to a different enantiomer.

The starting materials are A and B, reacting with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively. Wait, no, wait: the question says A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, and B with BH3 and H+. So the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second is B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyl... So the same product, but different enantiomers, based on the starting material and the reagent.

The options are four possibilities for A and B. Both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, but with different stereos at either R or S configuration.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's break this down. The product is a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure—pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H indicates the position of the double bond. The substituents are at position 4 (ethyl) and at position 2 (the ketone, since it's 2-one).

So, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ether. Wait, tetrahydro-pyran would be the six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen. The substituents are at positions 2 and 4. So, the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps formed from a diol or a glycol.

Wait, but the starting materials are 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. Let me think about what that looks like. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But 5-oxopentanoic acid would be CH2CH2CH2CO-COOH? Wait, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 5-oxo would be at the end. No, wait. The position is 5. So for pentanoic acid, the carboxylic acid is at position 5. So 5-oxo would be a ketone at the same position? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Let me number from the COOH end as position 1.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions are 1 (COOH), then 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, no, wait. The formula is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is pentanoic acid. So 5-oxo would be a ketone at position 5, but that's the COOH group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the carboxylic acid is at carbon 1. So in 5-oxopentanoic acid, the carbonyl is at carbon 5. But that's impossible because position 5 is the end. So perhaps it's an ester or some other structure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH2)3CO-COOH, but that would be 5-oxo. Wait, perhaps it's a diacid or something else. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the oxygen is on the fifth carbon, but that seems confusing. Let me think about the reaction.

The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So perhaps the starting material is a diol or a ketone that can undergo a cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, I think the starting material is a ketone, and when reduced, it forms an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, no: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone at position 2. So the ring has five carbons and one oxygen, and at position 2, there's a carbonyl group (hence the '2-one').

So, how would that form from the starting material?

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. Let me think about the structure:

The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, let me draw this. Pentanoic acid: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait: no, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons in a row, with COOH at the end.

5-oxo would mean a ketone at the fifth carbon, which would be the end. But that's the COOH, which is a carboxylic acid. Hmm, perhaps this is an ester? Or some other functional group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH-Et-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently. Perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone with isobutoxy and ethyl groups. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is a reduction. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically for carbonyl groups, but also can reduce esters and other groups.

Wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So perhaps the starting material is a diol or a diol derivative. But wait, the starting materials are A and B, which are pentanoic acid derivatives.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester or something similar, which upon reduction forms an alcohol that can undergo cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester or a ketone that upon reduction gives a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, let's think in terms of the product. The product is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group and a ketone. The ring is tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is similar to a cyclic ether with a ketone at position 2.

How would that form from a pentanoic acid? Maybe via a Robinson annulation or some kind of cyclization after reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, let's imagine the structure. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2-

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The main chain is five carbons. The COOH is on carbon 1. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group. Carbon 5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo group).

So, that would make the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but not sure about the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Positions 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3 has ethyl, 5 has isobutoxy and oxo.

So, structure:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(Et)-C(O-isobutoxy)-CH2?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

O
||
C(O-isobutoxy)-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(Et)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The starting material is 5-oxo-pentanoic acid, which is (COOH)CH2CH2CH2CO. But that doesn't make sense because the CO is at position 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic hemiacetal.

If the starting material is a beta-keto ester, perhaps upon reduction, the ketone group is reduced to an alcohol, leading to a diol structure which can cyclize.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry.

The product in reaction A is (R) configuration, and reaction B is (S). So the configuration of the starting material, along with the reducing agent, must influence the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration, but when used as a reducing agent, perhaps it's in a specific context. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent for ketones, giving secondary alcohols. BH3, when used with H+, perhaps is part of a hydroboration reaction, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe both are used for ketone reductions, but with different selectivities.

Wait, no. Wait, LiBH4 is a typical agent for reducing ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3, when used with THF or other solvents, also can reduce ketones, but perhaps with different stereochemistry.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which is a six-membered ring. So perhaps the starting material is a diol, which upon cyclization forms the ring.

Wait, but the starting materials are A and B, which are pentanoic acid derivatives. Maybe the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester or an acid, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone, and upon reduction, it becomes a secondary alcohol. Then, the presence of other functional groups like esters or ethers would allow for cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's say the structure is something like:

RCO-COOR', which upon reduction would form RCH(OH)-CH2OR' or something similar. Then, the diol could undergo cyclization.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the product structure.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has an ethyl group at position 4 and a ketone at position 2.

So, perhaps the ring is formed by connecting the oxygen, the ethyl group, and the ketone in a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, for example, something like:

RCO-(CH2)2-OR', which upon reduction would form RCH(OH)-(CH2)2-OR', and then cyclization would form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, and then cyclization occurs.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reducing agents again.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3, especially in the presence of a Lewis acid like THF, is used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes. But in this case, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reagent is reducing it.

Wait, but wait. BH3 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LiBH4. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. LiBH4 can reduce esters and amides, while BH3 is more selective for aldehydes and ketones, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction involves the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. So both LiBH4 and BH3 can reduce ketones, but BH3 might have some stereochemical influence.

Wait, for ketone reductions, LiBH4 typically gives the secondary alcohol without any stereoselectivity because the ketone is not a chiral center. Wait, but if the starting material is a chiral ketone, then the reduction could lead to either R or S configuration based on the starting material.

Wait, perhaps that's the key here. The starting material A is (R) configuration, and when reduced with LiBH4, it produces (R) product, and starting material B is (S) and when reduced with BH3, produces (S) product.

Wait, but how do the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry? Hmm. Maybe the reducing agents don't change the configuration but just add the hydrogen in a certain way.

Wait, in the reduction of ketones to alcohols using LiBH4, the hydrogen adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the borohydride adds to the adjacent carbon. But in ketones, the carbonyl is symmetric, so the addition is not stereoselective. Wait, but in the case where the ketone is part of a chiral center, then the configuration may influence the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the reduction leads to the inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, but in the case of a ketone, the reduction to secondary alcohol doesn't involve any inversion because the ketone is planar. The configuration of the starting material's chiral centers would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials A and B are enantiomers. So A is (R) and B is (S). Then, when each is reduced, the product would retain the configuration, leading to the (R) or (S) product.

But how does the reducing agent affect this? Or does it not affect it?

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the reaction differently. For example, LiBH4 might proceed via a certain mechanism that leads to a specific configuration, while BH3 does another.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't just a simple reduction but involves a protonation step that could influence the stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the product.

The product is (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the configuration is at the position where the ethyl group is attached, I think.

Wait, perhaps the ring is formed by the reduction and then cyclization. Let's say the starting material is a beta-keto ester.

So, the starting material would have a structure like:

RCO-COR', where R is ethyl or something else.

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (RCO-) would become RCH(OH)-, and the COR' would become CH2OR' or something similar.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Upon reduction, the ester would open, form an alcohol, and then cyclize again.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the product.

The product's configuration (R or S) depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's behavior.

Assuming the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center, when reduced, the configuration of that center would influence the product's configuration.

Wait, but the starting material A and B are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (R or S). So when reduced, their configuration would influence the product.

Wait, but that's in the starting material. So when the starting material is (R), and it's reduced, perhaps the configuration is retained or inverted.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is at a different position. So perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the product's configuration through the reduction and cyclization steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center which is adjacent to the ketone. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, which then forms a new chiral center in the product.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center, and upon reduction, the secondary alcohol has a new chiral center, whose configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent.

Wait, another approach: when a ketone is reduced, the borohydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydrogen adds to the adjacent carbon. But since the starting ketone is symmetric, the reduction would not create any new chiral centers unless the adjacent carbon was already chiral.

Wait, in the starting material, perhaps the 5-oxo group is at a position where the adjacent carbon is chiral. Let me think. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid has substituents at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo).

So the structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group (position 1), then CH2 (position 2), then CH(Et) (position 3), then CH2 (position 4), then C(O-isobutoxy) (position 5).

Wait, but position 5 is the end, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but wait, the 5-oxo would mean a ketone at position 5. But that's the same carbon as the COOH group. That can't be, because COOH is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's a gamma-keto acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure again. The product is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group and a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material, when reduced and cyclized, forms this ring.

So, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but the starting materials are A and B, which are pentanoic acid derivatives, so the chain is five carbons long.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the reactions leading to the product. The product is a cyclic hemiacetal, so perhaps the starting material is a diol. But the starting materials are acids, so that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and upon reduction, become alcohols which then undergo cyclization.

Wait, but the question says the starting materials are A and B, which are (S)- or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. So, they are both acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, and then undergoes esterification or cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, then the alcohol reacts with another part of the molecule to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a malonic ester or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Robinson annulation, which forms a six-membered ring via conjugate addition and cyclization. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, when reduced, forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes a cyclization to form the hemiacetal ring.

Let me think about the stereochemistry. If the starting material is (R), then the reduction would lead to an alcohol with a certain configuration, which after cyclization becomes the (R) product. Similarly for (S).

But how does the reducing agent influence the configuration? Or perhaps the reducing agent doesn't influence it, but the starting material's configuration does.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and when reduced, the configuration of the new chiral center (the secondary alcohol) is determined by the starting material's configuration.

Wait, because both A and B are reacting with different reducing agents, perhaps the agents affect the stereochemistry of the reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically doesn't have much selectivity in terms of stereochemistry for simple ketones. But maybe if the starting material is chiral, the configuration affects the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's method of addition (like BH3 vs LiBH4) leads to different configurations.

Wait, another point: BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereoselective. But in this case, BH3 is used with H+—could that be a hydroboration-oxidation reaction?

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So BH3 would react with the ketone. Wait, in ketone reductions, BH3 can also be used, but in practice, it's not as strong as LiBH4. So maybe the reaction with BH3 isn't as efficient, but that's not directly relevant to the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a hydride shift or some other mechanism that affects the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism for LiBH4 and BH3 is different. For example, BH3 might involve a different pathway that leads to retention or inversion of configuration.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reducing agents open it up in a way that leads to different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects how the cyclic hemiacetal forms. For example, if the starting material is (R), the ring forms in a way that leads to the (R) product, and vice versa.

But this is getting a bit murky. Let me try to approach this from the options.

The options are about whether A and B are (R) or (S) configurations, and whether they are the same or different.

The product for reaction A (with LiBH4) is (R), and reaction B (with BH3) is (S). So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agents influence the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents cause the configuration to invert or not. For example, if LiBH4 leads to retention and BH3 leads to inversion, then the starting material would need to be (R) for A, leading to (R) product, and (S) for B, leading to (S) product.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true.

Wait, but in ketone reductions, the addition of the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) to the planar carbonyl carbon doesn't create any new chiral centers unless the alpha carbon is already chiral. Wait, but the starting material's alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the ketone) is already chiral. So, when the ketone is reduced, the resulting alcohol would have a new chiral center, whose configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration is at position 3, I think. Let me think again: the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(Et)(X) - CH2 - C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, not exactly. Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CH3? No, because it's pentanoic acid, so five carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Carboxylic acid (1) -> CH2 (2) -> CH(Et) (3) -> CH(O-...) (4) -> C=O (5).

Wait, that would make it 5-oxo. But that would make the structure:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(Et)

4: CH(O-isobutoxy)

5: C=O

But that would make the molecule CH2=O at the end, which is a ketone. So, positions 1 to 5 would be COOH, CH2, CH(Et), CH(O-...), and CO.

Wait, but that makes the molecule 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents on the 3rd and 5th positions.

So, the starting material has a chain of five carbons, with the COOH at position 1, an ethyl group on position 3, and an isobutoxy and ketone on position 5.

Now, when this ketone is reduced, the CO becomes a CH2OH group. Wait, no, when a ketone is reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the CO at position 5 becomes CH(OH).

So, the product after reduction would have a CH(OH) group at position 5.

But the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which implies that the OH group at position 5 would react with another part of the molecule to form an ether linkage, closing the ring.

Ah, so the OH at position 5 would form a ring by connecting to another part of the molecule.

Wait, the starting material has a COOH group at position 1. Upon reduction, position 5 becomes CH(OH). Then, perhaps the OH at position 5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the COOH group, leading to a cyclic hemiacetal. But wait, the COOH is a carboxylic acid, which is a strong acid. To form a hemiacetal, the OH would need to attack an electrophilic carbon, perhaps a carbonyl.

But wait, if the COOH is deprotonated, it becomes COO-, which is a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction becomes an alcohol, which then can form a hemiacetal.

But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed by cyclization of the alcohol with an ester group or another oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, the molecule becomes something like:

CH2CH(Et)CH2CH(OH)COOH

Wait, but that's a linear structure. To form a six-membered ring, the OH would need to connect to the COO group, perhaps.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the OH would need to form a bond with a carbon that's four carbons away. So, perhaps the OH is at position 5, and it forms a bond with position 1 (the COOH group), but that would be a five-membered ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the chain is longer than I thought. Let me recount: the starting material is 5-oxopentanoic acid. So, five carbons in the chain, with the COOH at position 5? Wait, no, that can't be because pentanoic acid has five carbons, with COOH at position 1.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentan-2-one. No, the question states it's a pentanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(O-...)-CO.

Wait, that can't be because CO would be a ketone, but that's at position 5. So, the structure is:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(Et)

4: CH(O-...)

5: C=O.

Wait, but that would make the molecule 5-oxopentanoic acid, which is possible.

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with a ketone at position 5. When that's reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol at position 5, making it a secondary alcohol.

So, the molecule becomes:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(O-...)-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct: the reduction of the ketone (C=O) at position 5 would add two hydrogens, making it a CH2 group. Wait, no, no. Wait, no: ketone reduction adds H to the carbonyl carbon. So, R-CO-R' becomes R-CH(OH)-R'.

So, in our case, the CO at position 5 becomes CH(OH).

So, the structure after reduction would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(O-...)-CH(OH).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the exact structure.

But the key point is that the reduction of the ketone at position 5 creates an alcohol (-OH) at that position. Then, this OH can react with another part of the molecule to form a ring.

So, if the OH is at position 5, and the COOH is at position 1, the OH needs to attack a carbon that's four positions away to form a six-membered ring. That would be position 1 (the COOH group), but that's a carboxylic acid which may not be a good electrophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Then, after reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, which can form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the starting materials are acids, according to the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the esterification occurs after reduction, allowing the OH group to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH at position 5 reacts with the CH2 group at position 3 or something.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let me think about the stereochemistry and the options.

The products are (R) and (S) enantiomers, so the starting materials must have opposite configurations if the reaction leads to inversion. Wait, but reaction A uses LiBH4 and gives (R), while reaction B uses BH3 and gives (S).

So, perhaps the same starting material, when treated with different reducing agents, gives different configurations.

But that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and should give the same product each time. Unless the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration (R or S) leads to the product's configuration when reduced.

So, if A is (R), and when reduced with LiBH4 gives (R) product, and B is (S), and when reduced with BH3 gives (S) product, then the correct option would have A as (R) and B as (S), which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says A is (R), B is (S).

Option C says A is (S), B is (R).

So, according to this reasoning, option D would be correct.

But why would the reducing agents affect the configuration? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material's configuration, so if A is (R), it gives (R) product, and B is (S), it gives (S) product.

So, looking at the options, option D has A as (R) and B as (S), which would produce the correct (R) and (S) products.

Therefore, the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for reaction A and BH3 for reaction B. The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing in their stereochemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom and a ketone at position 2. The ethyl group is at position 4. This product forms via reduction of the starting material followed by cyclization.

2. **Starting Material**: The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids with two possible configurations: (R) and (S). These compounds have a ketone at position 5 and an ethyl group at position 3.

3. **Reduction and Cyclization**: 
   - Reduction of the ketone at position 5 converts it into a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).
   - The resulting alcohol undergoes cyclization to form the six-membered ring, with the stereochemistry of the starting material influencing the configuration of the product.

4. **Stereochemistry**:
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product. If the starting material is (R), the product is (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product is (S).
   - The reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) do not alter the stereochemical relationship between the starting material and the product.

5. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in both products being (S), which is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in both products being (R), which is incorrect.
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, which is incorrect because the products are (R) and (S), not the reverse.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would produce (R) and (S) products, respectively, which matches the given information.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for reaction B. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
