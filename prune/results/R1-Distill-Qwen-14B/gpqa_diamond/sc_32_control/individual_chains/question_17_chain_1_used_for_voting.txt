Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A through D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. So, when Ca-EDTA is in solution, it forms a complex. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of that complex. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant is important here. I think for a metal complex like Ca-EDTA, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). 

But wait, in this problem, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the dissociation? Since K is so large (5e10), the complex doesn't dissociate much. That suggests that the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low.

So, we can model this with an equilibrium expression. Let me set up the variables. Let me denote:

[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M (since it's given as the concentration of the complex)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = y

But wait, from the reaction, each mole of CaEDTA²- dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, the initial concentrations before dissociation would have CaEDTA²- as 0.02 M, and Ca²+ and EDTA^4- as 0. But since the complex doesn't dissociate much, x and y would be very small.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the sum of the dissociated and undissociated forms. Or wait, no. The concentration given is the concentration of the complex itself. So, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, no, because the formation constant is K, which is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. So, the complex is formed when Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine.

But wait, in solution, the complex is present, and a little bit dissociates. So, perhaps the initial assumption is that almost all of the 0.02 M is the complex, and the free ions are negligible. But let's model it properly.

Let me set up an ICE table. Wait, no, because the complex is already present. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let me let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M, and the dissociation releases x amount of Ca²+ and x amount of EDTA^4-.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x

But wait, since K is very large, x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02.

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So, plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

=> 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10 )

x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 2/(5e13) → 4e-15?

Wait, let me compute that again.

0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10 )

Which is 2/(5e12) → 4e-13? Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So, x squared is 4e-13, so x is the square root of 4e-13.

Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7, since sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7.

So, x = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation releases x each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the formation constant equation is correct. K is indeed 5e10, which is a large number, so the dissociation is minimal, so x is small compared to 0.02.

So, x^2 = 0.02 / K = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents earlier.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 equals (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12. So, 4e-13. Wait, no: 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, and 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So, 2 *3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7, which is 6.3e-7. So, option C.

I think that makes sense. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), we let the dissociation release \( x \) of both \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\). Thus:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
