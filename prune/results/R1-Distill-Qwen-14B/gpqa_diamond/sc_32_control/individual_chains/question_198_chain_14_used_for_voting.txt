Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They're asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all cobalt species. Oh right, I remember that cobalt forms different complexes with thiocyanate, and each has a different stability constant. 

Wait, the problem gives me β1 to β4, which are the stability constants. Stability constants, right, they indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, and β4 is 16. Hmm, wait, but β4 is 16 which is lower than β2 and β3. So the order of stability for the complexes would be β3 > β2 > β4 > β1. Wait, no, wait, β1 is the first complex, Co(SCN)₂ maybe? Or is each β the next complex.

Wait, I think for metal complexes, each β is the stability constant for the nth complex. So, for Co(SCN)ⁿ⁺, βn is the constant for the nth step. So for example, β1 is for Co(SCN)²⁺, β2 is for Co(SCN)₃²⁺, and so on.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The stability constant, β, is for each successive addition of ligand. So for a metal ion M, the first complex would be ML, and β1 is its stability constant. The second complex is ML₂, with β2 = [ML₂]/([ML][L]), and so on. So each β is for adding another ligand to the previous complex. Or wait, is it the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands? Oh wait, sometimes the overall constant is represented as βn, so for Co(SCN)n²−, the βn would be the overall constant for the formation of that complex from Co²+ and n SCN−.

So, for the problem, each β represents the overall constant for the complex with that many SCN− ligands. So β1 is Co(SCN)²+, β2 is Co(SCN)₂²+, β3 is Co(SCN)₃²+, and β4 is Co(SCN)₄²−.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN− ligands. So that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, which corresponds to β2 of 40.

Wait, but wait. No, the blue dithiocyanato is actually the tetra-aqua dithiocyanato complex, or is it the hexaaqua? No, wait, I think the blue color is for the [Co(SCN)₂(H₂O)₂]²+ complex. Wait, that's the one I remember from the Co(II) thiocyanate complexes. There are different isomers, but the blue one is the one with two SCN− ligands, so the complex [Co(SCN)₂(H₂O)₂]²+.

So in solution, the cobalt exists in various forms: Co²+ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]²+ (monothiocyanato), [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (dithiocyanato), [Co(SCN)₃]²− (trithiocyanato), and maybe [Co(SCN)₄]²−, but the stability constants vary.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (but wait, it's actually [Co(SCN)₂(H₂O)_x]²+ where x varies, but I think for the purpose of calculation, we can treat it as the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, so [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

So all the cobalt species include the free Co²+ and all the complexes up to the fourth one. The problem says the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. SCN− is 0.1 M.

But wait, the stability constants are given for each complex. So the formation of each complex depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The approach here is to calculate the fraction of Co²+ that is in each complex form, and then find out what percentage is in the dithiocyanato form.

So, the general approach is to model the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

In solution, the various species are:

Co²+ → free ion

Co(SCN)²+ → first complex, β1 =9

Co(SCN)₂²+ → second complex, β2=40

Co(SCN)₃²− → third complex, β3=63

Co(SCN)₄²− → fourth complex, β4=16

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the stability constants are given for each step. Or are they the overall constants for each complex? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for the first complex, Co(SCN)²+, the overall β1 is 9.

Wait, but wait. For the first complex, formation is:

Co²+ + SCN− ⇌ Co(SCN)²+; β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co²+][SCN−]) = 9.

Similarly, for the second complex, it's the formation of Co(SCN)₂²+:

Co(SCN)²+ + SCN− ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+; β2 = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co(SCN)][SCN−]) = 40.

Wait, but in that case, the overall β for Co(SCN)₂²+ would be β1 * β2, because each step is a multiplication.

Wait no, because each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall β for Co(SCN)₂²+ is β1 * β2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)₃²−, it's β1*β2*β3.

Wait, but wait, the given β4 is 16. So let me think. Does β4 represent the stepwise constant for the fourth addition, or the overall for the fourth complex?

I think the given β values are the overall stability constants for each complex. So for Co(SCN)₂²+, β2 is 40. But wait, that doesn't fit with the stepwise approach. Hmmm.

Wait, no, perhaps the given β's are the overall stability constants for each complex, meaning:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co²+][SCN−]) =9

β2= [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ / ([Co²+][SCN−]^2) =40

β3= [Co(SCN)3]^−2 / ([Co²+][SCN−]^3)=63

β4= [Co(SCN)4]^2− / ([Co²+][SCN−]^4)=16

Wait, but if that's the case, then the concentrations of each complex are related via βn and the ligand concentrations.

So the fraction of each species depends on the product of βn and the ligand concentration to the nth power, divided by (1 + sum of all such terms for n=0 to 4).

Wait, but wait, the free Co²+ is n=0, so [Co^2+] = [Co^2+] (n=0), and the others are [Co(SCN)]²+, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc.

So the fraction for each species is:

f_n = βn [SCN]^n / ( [Co²+] (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k) ) )

Wait, but wait, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species:

c(Co) = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]²+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^−2 + [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

But since all the stability constants are given, perhaps we can model the fraction of each species.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the distribution of the species using the given β's and the ligand concentration.

But in this problem, the ligand concentration is [SCN−] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt is 0.01 M.

But wait, the solution has a lot of SCN−: 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than the total Co concentration.

So the solution is SCN− rich.

Given that, the ligand is in excess, so more complexes are formed.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each Co species, and find the fraction that is in the dithiocyanato form, i.e., [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

So, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

For each n (n=0,1,2,3,4), the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Because [Co^2+] = [Co] total * (β0 / sum), where β0 is 1 (since [Co²+] = [Co²+] ), but wait, let's think about it.

The equilibrium is Co²+ + n SCN− ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^? ; βn.

So for each species, the concentration is [Co][SCN]^n * βn.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of each species is given by their βn [SCN]^n / [Co²+].

Wait, let me think again. The formation of each complex is:

Co²+ + n SCN− ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²−+2(n-2) ?

Wait, maybe I should focus on the fractions. The fraction of each species is proportional to βn [SCN]^n.

Because, for each n, the concentration [Co(SCN)_n] is proportional to βn [SCN]^n.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Wait, but β0 would be 1, because for n=0, it's the free Co²+ concentration, which is [Co²+] = [Co_total] * (β0 [SCN]^0) / sum.

Wait, perhaps β0 is 1 because for n=0, it's just Co²+.

So, the fractions are based on each term being βn [SCN]^n.

So, for each n from 0 to 4, we have:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

But wait, wait, no. Because the free Co²+ (n=0) term is [Co²+] = [Co_total] * (1) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Wait, no, because the denominator would include [Co_total] as well. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about it.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species:

c = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]²+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^−2 + [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

But each term can be written in terms of [Co²+], using the stability constants.

For example:

[CoSCN]²+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN] 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 

[Co(SCN)3]^−2 = β3 [Co²+][SCN]^3 

[Co(SCN)4]^2− = β4 [Co²+][SCN]^4 

So,

c = [Co²+] + β1 [Co²+][SCN] + β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co²+][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co²+][SCN]^4 

So,

[Co²+] = c / ( 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So the fraction of each species is:

f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / c = (βn [SCN]^n) / ( 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Because,

f_0 = [Co²+]/c = 1 / denominator.

Which is the same as (1 * [SCN]^0) / denominator.

So yes, the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator.

So, the denominator is sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k.

Wait, but β0 is 1, because for n=0, it's [Co²+] = β0 [Co²+].

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So, for each n, f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator.

In our case, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So, let's compute each term.

First, calculate each βn [SCN]^n.

Given:
β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So,

n=0: β0 =1, [SCN]^0=1 → term =1*1=1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]^1=0.1 → term=9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40 * 0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 63 * 0.001 =0.063.

n=4: β4=16, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now, sum all these terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 +0.0016.

Let me add them:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +0.4 = 2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016≈2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_2 is for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), which is 0.4 / 2.3646.

Calculating 0.4 / 2.3646.

Hmm, 0.4 is 4/10, 2.3646 is ~2.3646.

Divide 4/10 by 2.3646.

4/10 =0.4.

0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So, approximately 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

But wait, wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but wait, in the complexes, the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, but I thought β2 is 40, which is the overall constant for that complex.

Wait, but wait, that's correct, so according to the calculation, the fraction is ~16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 +0.063 +0.0016.

Let me add them again:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646. Yes.

Now, the term for n=2 is 0.4.

So 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I thought earlier that the dithiocyanato is the most stable complex, but according to the fractions, it's the second highest. Let me check.

Wait, the terms are:

n=0 →1.

n=1 →0.9.

n=2 →0.4.

n=3 →0.063.

n=4 →0.0016.

So the order of fractions is highest for n=0 (1), then n=1 (0.9), then n=2 (0.4), then n=3, then n=4.

Wait, that's interesting. So the majority of Co is in the free form (n=0, 1/2.3646 ≈42.27%) and the next is n=1 (0.9/2.3646≈38.07%).

Then n=2 (16.9%).

So, the dithiocyanato complex is the third most abundant, but the highest is the free Co²+.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So 16.9% is the correct answer.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. These represent the overall stability constants for the complexes:
     - [Co(SCN)]²⁺ (β₁ = 9),
     - [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ (β₂ = 40),
     - [Co(SCN)₃]²⁻ (β₃ = 63),
     - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (β₄ = 16).

2. **Fraction of Each Species**:
   - The fraction of cobalt in each species is proportional to the term βₙ[SCN]ⁿ, where n is the number of SCN⁻ ligands bound to cobalt.
   - The total fraction denominator is the sum of all terms: \( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 \).

3. **Calculation of Terms**:
   - For [SCN] = 0.1 M, calculate each term:
     - \( n = 0: \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \),
     - \( n = 1: \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \),
     - \( n = 2: \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \),
     - \( n = 3: \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \),
     - \( n = 4: \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

4. **Sum of Terms**:
   - Denominator = \( 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 \).

5. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   - The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, \( n = 2 \)) is:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
     \]

6. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:
     \[
     0.169 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
