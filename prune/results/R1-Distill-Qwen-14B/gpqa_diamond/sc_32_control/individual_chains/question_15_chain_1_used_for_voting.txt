Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, right? Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. Their host stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, so they'll pick the planet with a higher chance.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star. The formula I think is something like P = R_star / a, or more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by something else maybe. Wait, no, the transit probability formula I recall is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / M_planet)) )) or something, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, that might approximate to P ≈ R_star/(a * (M_star^(1/3)))... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability, or the geometric probability, depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / M_planet)) )) but since M_planet is way smaller than M_star, the sqrt term is approximately 1. So the probability simplifies to P ≈ R_star/(a) * something else. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with the transit depth.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is actually P = (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / M_planet)) )) but wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the probability inversely proportional to the star's mass, which doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

I think the correct formula is the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (R_earth / R_star), but wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me remember: the transit probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius, but I'm getting confused. No, wait, the probability is more about the alignment. The star's size (R_star) and the orbital distance (a) determine how likely the planet passes in front. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (M_star / m_planet))) ), but maybe that's for the transit depth.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I can try to derive it. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star/a. But I'm not sure if that's the only factor.

Wait, another angle. The probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit subtends (as seen from Earth). So, the probability P is (π R_star²) / (4 π a² (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so P = (R_star²) / (4 a²). So P is proportional to (R_star^2)/(a^2). But wait, that would be the case if the planet's size is negligible. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by something else? No, wait no, I think the correct formula without the π and area ratios would be P = (R_star / a) * some factor.

Wait, another source I remember: the transit probability is given by P = (R_star / a) multiplied by ( (R_planet + R_star) / (a * sqrt(1 + (M_star / m_planet)) )) ). But I'm not quite sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / m_planet)) )) ), but that might not be correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability is given by P = (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / m_planet)) )) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the probability is the ratio of the radius of the star to the orbital distance. So P = R_star / a. Because the star's radius is the size the planet needs to cover, and the orbital distance determines how much of the sky the planet sweeps. So closer planets have higher probability since a is smaller.

Wait, but if that's the case, then for two planets with the same R_star, the one with smaller a has higher P. So in our problem, Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. Since Kepler's third law says P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) a^3, but since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a^3. So a is proportional to P^(2/3) / M_star^(1/3).

Wait, let's get the exact relation. Kepler's third law: a³ = (G (M_star + m_planet) P² ) / (4 π²). Since m_planet is negligible, a ≈ [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) → a ∝ P^(2/3) * M_star^(-1/3).

So for Planet_1, P1 = P, and Planet_2 has P2 = 3P. So a1 = (P)^2/(M1) )^(1/3) * const, and a2 = ( (3P)^2 / M2 )^(1/3) * const.

But M1 is 2*M2 (since the star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star). So M1 = 2 M2.

So a1 = ( (P²) / (2 M2) )^(1/3 ) * const.

a2 = ( (9 P²) / M2 )^(1/3 ) * const.

So a1 = [ (P²)/(2 M2) ]^(1/3) → Let's factor out [ (P²/M2) ]^(1/3) which is the same for both, so a1 = (1/2)^(1/3) * a2' where a2' is based on M2. Wait, more accurately:

a1 = [ (P²) / (2 M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ ( (3P)^2 ) / (M2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ 9 P² / M2 ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ P² / (2 M2) ]^(1/3 ) = [ (1/2) * (P² / M2) ]^(1/3 ) = (1/2)^(1/3) * [ (P² / M2) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [9 * (P² / M2) ]^(1/3 ) = 9^(1/3) * [ (P² / M2) ]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = (1/2)^(1/3) / 9^(1/3) ) = (1/(2*9))^(1/3) ) = (1/18)^(1/3 )

Wait, but 9 is (3^2), so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3). Similarly, 2^(1/3) is cube root of 2. So:

a1/a2 = (1/(2*9) )^(1/3 ) = (1/18 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1 / 2.6207 ≈ 0.381.

Alternatively, 18^(1/3) is approximately 2.62, so a1 is about 0.38 times a2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute a1 and a2 in terms of a ratio.

Wait, but let me consider the exact expressions:

a1 = [ G (2 M2) P1² / (4 pi^2) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G (M2) (3P1)^2 / (4 pi^2) ]^(1/3 )

So let's compute the ratio a2 / a1.

a2 = [ G M2 (9 P1^2) / (4 pi²) ]^(1/3 )

a1 = [ G (2 M2) P1² / (4 pi²) ]^(1/3 )

Divide a2 by a1:

a2/a1 = [ (9 M2 P1²) / (2 M2 P1²) ) ]^(1/3 )

The M2 and P1² terms cancel out:

= (9/2 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1. So a1 is smaller than a2 by a factor of about 0.6 (since 1/1.65 = 0.606).

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_star / a ), assuming the other factors are the same. Wait, but the question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 = R/(a1 ), P2 = R/(a2 )

So P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2 ) ) = a2 / a1 = 1.65.

So Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's. So the chance of transit for Planet_1 is higher, so they should observe Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, another factor: the probability also depends on the star's mass? Or did I miss that?

Wait, no, in the formula I used, the probability is (R_star / a ), but let me think again. Actually, isn't the transit probability also dependent on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. But in this case, both stars have the same radius.

Wait, but wait, another factor I might have missed: the planet's size. The probability is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a. But since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar. So R_planet is the same for both, so R_star dominates this term. So R_planet is negligible compared to R_star, so the ratio R + r_planet ≈ R. So yes, P is proportional to R/(a), which is the same for both since R is same, so P is inversely proportional to a.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 is larger than P2.

From earlier, we found that a2 = 1.65 a1. So P2 = R/(a2) = R/(1.65 a1 ) = (1/1.65) * (R/a1 ) = (1/1.65) P1.

So P1 = 1.65 P2 → which means Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, which has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation. Because earlier, when I calculated a2/a1, I found it was (9/2 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65. So a2 is 1.65 times a1.

So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/(1.65 a1 ) → P1 = 1.65 P2. So the probability of Planet_1 is higher by 1.65 times.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but the initial problem says both have same masses. Wait, the problem states that both planets have the same masses, but their host stars have different masses.

Wait, but for the transit probability, the mass of the star affects the orbital distance a via Kepler's law. So since Planet_1's star is more massive, for the same orbital period, Planet_1 would have a smaller a. But in this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter period than Planet_2. So we have to factor that in.

Wait, our earlier calculation already considered that Planet_1 has a shorter period. So I think the earlier conclusion holds.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The geometric transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both planets orbit stars of the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto \frac{P^2}{M_{\text{star}}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), and its host star has mass \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2M_{\text{star,2}} \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 = 3P_1 \), and its host star has mass \( M_{\text{star,2}} \).

The orbital distances are:
\[
a_1 \propto \frac{P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,1}}} = \frac{P_1^2}{2M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]
\[
a_2 \propto \frac{P_2^2}{M_{\text{star,2}}} = \frac{(3P_1)^2}{M_{\text{star,2}}} = \frac{9P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,2}}}
\]

Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{\frac{9P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,2}}}}{\frac{P_1^2}{2M_{\text{star,2}}}} = 9 \cdot \frac{2}{1} = 18 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_2 = \sqrt[3]{18} \cdot a_1 \approx 1.65 \cdot a_1
\]

Thus, Planet_2's orbital distance \( a_2 \) is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_1 (\( a_1 \)).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:
\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{1}{a_2}
\]
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
