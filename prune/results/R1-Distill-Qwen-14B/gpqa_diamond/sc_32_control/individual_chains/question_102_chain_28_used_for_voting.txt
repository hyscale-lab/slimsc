Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically dealing with transgenic constructs and expression in mice. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

Hmm, the setup is that someone identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and wants to study their developmental roles. So they've made a bicistronic vector with both the ligand and receptor. The vector is set up with lox-P sites and stop cassettes, which usually means it's using Cre-recombinase to excise the stop cassettes, allowing both genes to be expressed.

The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Wait, no, more accurately: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So I think this is a setup where Cre can excise these stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed when Cre is present.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin, which probably means the loading controls are working. So the proteins are being expressed, but then when they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal under the confocal. Green would come from eGFP, which is on the receptor construct.

So what's going on here? Let's think about the expression setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it can express two proteins from a single transcript. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, then through the IRES, the receptor is expressed. But wait, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF. But the stop cassettes complicate this.

The stop cassettes are flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites. Cre can recombine these sites. But the difference is that regular Cre (loxP) and a mutant Cre (lox2272) have different specificities. Oh wait, I think lox2272 is a variant that can't be cut by wild-type Cre, but can be cut by a mutant Cre. Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me get that right. LoxP is recognized by wild-type Cre, while lox2272 is a mutated site that requires a Cre variant, perhaps like Dre or another recombinase. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a site that can't be cut by wild-type Cre but can be cut by a different recombinase. Alternatively, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The wild-type Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. lox2272 is a lox variant that is recognized by a mutant Cre, like Cre-ER or some other form. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, I think lox2272 is the site that Cre doesn't recognize unless it's a specific mutant Cre. Oh wait, no, when using the Cre-lox system for excision, loxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutated version. But in a dual cassette, perhaps both are present so that Cre can cut both. Wait, but in the question, the ligand's stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry with loxP, and the receptor's stop cassette has lox2272. So the idea is that Cre will excise both stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor active in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives. So in this case, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. Then, the receptor should be expressed along with eGFP, so when they look, they should see eGFP fluorescence.

But they don't see any green signal. So why is the eGFP not being expressed? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell, since they're using a bicistronic vector. If they're in the same cell, they should autostimulate, but this probably doesn't affect the expression of eGFP. So maybe this option isn't the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it's not transported to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But why would the construct be stuck? Maybe a problem with the signal peptide or something. But the construct's expression was confirmed in the Western blot, so the protein is made. If the Western blot showed the receptor, perhaps it's properly processed. Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection into astrocytes, which are different cells than neural crest cells. Maybe in the mice, the expression is different? Not sure, but the question says they tested the construct in the Western, which shows the proteins are expressed. So this might not be the issue.

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter; it's a cytomegalovirus-related promoter. So it's constitutive. The IRES is for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, then perhaps the ligand is not expressed. But in the question, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive expression in neural crest cells. Wait, the vector's enhancer would be the CBA, which is constitutive, so it's expressed everywhere. But in the mice, they're being expressed under the control of the promoter in the vector. But the Cre would be under the control of SOX10, which is neural crest specific. So in the absence of Cre, the stops would remain, right? Wait, no. Because the vector is in the mouse, and the Cre comes from the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, they have the construct with the loxP and lox2272 stops. When Cre is present (from SOX10), it should excise both stops. So if the enhancer is missing, perhaps the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. But the CBA promoter is strong, so it should drive expression regardless of tissue. Hmm, maybe this is not the issue, but I'm not certain.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait. The construct for the receptor is at the 3' end. The vector has the ligand ORF, then a stop cassette with loxP, then the receptor, which is under the IRES. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the setup. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it's designed to express two proteins from a single transcript. The first ORF is the ligand, under the CBA promoter. Then, an IRES, followed by the receptor ORF. But between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Wait, mCherry is fused to the ligand? Or is it a separate reporter?

Wait, let me clarify the vector setup. The vector is bicistronic, so it's a single transcript that encodes two proteins. The first ORF is the ligand, which is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), followed by the receptor ORF, which is under an IRES element. Wait, no, the IRES comes after the ligand. Wait, perhaps the structure is CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> eGFP. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand gene with a stop cassette, then the receptor gene with another stop cassette. When Cre is present, it deletes both stops, allowing both genes to be expressed. So the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the receptor is expressed under IRES. So when Cre is active, the stops are removed, allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

But then, when they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should be active in the neural crest cells. So the stops should be removed, leading to expression of both ligand and receptor. Then, the eGFP on the receptor should be expressed. But they don't see green. So why?

Looking at the options again, the issue is that eGFP isn't expressed. So maybe the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being properly expressed. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, in frame? Oh, wait, the ORF is in frame. If the stop cassette is in between, and the stop is removed, but the eGFP is in a separate construct, perhaps there's a frame shift.

Wait, the vector setup is that the ligand is fused to mCherry. Wait, no, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor is a fusion with eGFP. Wait, or are the stop cassettes between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins.

Let me get this right. The ligand's ORF is at the 5', followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), and then mCherry. No, wait, the question says the ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So ligand-mCherry as a single ORF? No, because it's under a stop cassette. Wait, no. The ligand is at 5', then a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor, fused to eGFP. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the vector structure.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up so that after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the IRES to function so the receptor ORF is expressed. The ligand is then expressed as a separate protein, perhaps with mCherry tag, and the receptor is expressed as a separate protein with eGFP.

Wait, maybe the vector is designed so that the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But the stop cassettes prevent their expression unless Cre is present to remove them.

Wait, perhaps the ligand is under the CBA promoter as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor is under the IRES as a fusion with eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. When Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, allowing both to be expressed.

But in the setup, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles have this vector. Then, crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would activate Cre in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops are removed, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with their fluorescent tags.

But on Western blot, after transfection into astrocytes, they saw signals proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed when transfected, implying the construct is working. So why in the mouse they don't see eGFP?

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised properly. But why?

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. If the ORFs are out of frame, you get a truncated or nonfunctional protein, but eGFP is a separate construct. No, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassette wasn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is active in the neural crest. So the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in neural crest cells. If it's not happening, perhaps the Cre isn't active. But they used SOX10-Cre, which should be active in those cells.

Wait, another possibility: the loxP and lox2272 sites are different. So maybe the same Cre can't cut both. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (like a mutated version). But their Cre is wild-type. So in the vector, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites, which wild-type Cre can cut. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272 sites, which wild-type Cre cannot cut. Oh! So the ligand's stop is removed because Cre can cut loxP, but the receptor's stop isn't removed because wild-type Cre can't cut lox2272. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, because the stop remains.

So the ligand would be expressed (since its stop is excised), but the receptor's stop is not excised because the Cre can't recognize lox2272. Therefore, in the mouse, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP. That would explain why no green signal.

But why was there expression in the Western blot after transfection? Because in the transfection, perhaps the stop wasn't in the way, or maybe the transient expression didn't require the stop.

Alternatively, in the transient transfection, they might have used a plasmid without the stop cassettes, or perhaps the plasmid wasn't properly set up. But the question says the stop cassettes are present, so in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor shouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but when you transfect the plasmid into astrocytes, which presumably don't express Cre, then the stops would remain, so the ligand and receptor shouldn't be expressed. But the question says that the Western blot showed signals. So perhaps in the plasmid, the stops were not functional, or the transient transfection didn't require Cre. Maybe the plasmid was designed so that the stops are only under the influence of Cre, but without Cre, the vectors are not expressing. But in the question, the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins showed signals, implying that the proteins were expressed. So if the stops are in the construct, without Cre, the proteins shouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot showed they were. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps in the plasmid, the stops are flanked by loxP sites, allowing for expression in the absence of Cre. No, normally, the stop cassette would prevent expression. So the only way the Western blot would show expression is if the stops are not present, or Cre was active during transfection. But the question says the plasmid was transfected into astrocytes, which don't have Cre unless transfected with the plasmid. But I don't think the plasmid includes Cre. So maybe the stops were not properly inserted, or the Cre was somehow active.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid is in a cell line that has Cre activity. But the question says primary astrocyte culture. So perhaps that's not the case.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me focus back on the question. They used a bicistronic vector with loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. They transfected into astrocytes and saw expression, implying that the stops were not effective in preventing expression (so perhaps the plasmid didn't have the stops, but the question says it does). Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid's stops are not correctly placed.

But in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, they don't see eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stops are not excised, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But why wouldn't the Cre excise the stops?

Ah! Because the lox2272 sites aren't cut by wild-type Cre. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, which Cre can cut, so ligand would be expressed. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but the receptor (with eGFP) is not. So when they look for green (eGFP), they don't see anything.

So the problem is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't excised because the Cre used (SOX10-Cre) is wild-type and can't cut lox2272.

Looking at the options, which one fits this? The question is why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. No, that would affect the protein structure.

Option C: enhancer missing. No, the promoter is CBA, which is constitutive.

Option A: paracrine relationship. Unrelated to the expression construct.

Option B: stuck in Golgi. Could be, but why would only the eGFP be affected?

So the correct explanation is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 stop cassette, so the receptor isn't expressed. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly states this. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

C) the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Wait, none of these options directly address the issue of Cre not being able to cut the lox2272 sites. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed in a way that the eGFP is not correctly under the same reading frame as the receptor. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, the receptor's ORF is followed by the stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre is supposed to excise the stop. If the stop wasn't excised (because Cre can't cut lox2272), then the receptor's ORF is truncated, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. The reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by the wild-type Cre.

But the options don't have this as an option. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA, then a stop cassette, then an IRES, then the receptor, then another stop cassette before eGFP. Or perhaps the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, followed by the receptor's ORF with a stop cassette.

Wait, another possibility: the vector might have the ligand and the receptor each under their own promoters, but I don't think that's the case because it's a bicistronic vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed without the need for Cre. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is not working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options don't mention anything about the lox sites or Cre. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the Western blot after transfection showed the proteins were expressed, but the mouse doesn't. So maybe in the mouse, the expression isn't happening because the frame is wrong.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, leading to no expression. But I'm not sure how this would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in a way that it's not in frame with the receptor's ORF, so when the stop is removed, it's a frame shift, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP.

Wait, but the stop is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. Without the stop, the receptor is expressed, and then eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF under the same transcript? Or is it a separate ORF?

Wait, in a bicistronic vector with IRES, each ORF is translated separately. So the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. But in this case, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor, which is followed by another stop cassette.

So when Cre is present, it cuts the lox sites and removes the stops, allowing the ligand and receptor ORFs to be expressed.

But the presence of eGFP is only if the stop is removed.

So if the Receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, and the Cre can't cut it, then the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong, but I'm not seeing how that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up so that the ligand is expressed as a fusion to mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion to eGFP. So the ligand ORF is directly followed by mCherry, but with a stop. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand-mCherry is not expressed. Similarly, the receptor-eGFP is not expressed. But when Cre is present, it removes the stops, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But if the lox2272 stop is not cut by the Cre, then the receptor-eGFP remains under the stop, so it's not expressed. So in the mouse, the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But why would the Western blot show expression? Because in the transient transfection, maybe the stops were not properly inserted, or the cells had Cre activity. Alternatively, perhaps the transient transfection used a Cre-expressing vector.

But the question says that the vector has the stops. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor shouldn't be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame, leading to no expression. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the IRES element might be positioned in a way that it doesn't allow the receptor to be expressed. But that's more about the regulatory elements, which would tie into option C, which mentions the enhancer. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so enhancer might not be the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the wrong orientation. But the question says it's fused to the C-terminus, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, the correct answer is likely option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop cassette wasn't excised, the translation would read through into the eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 stop wasn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options mention this.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is on the same construct but in a different frame, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe the stop between the receptor and eGFP wasn't excised, preventing eGFP from being expressed. But then, why would the receptor be expressed? If the stop before the receptor is excised, the receptor is expressed, but the stop after it isn't, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But that would mean the receptor is expressed but without eGFP. But the question doesn't have an option about eGFP not being expressed because the stop wasn't excised.

Wait, the setup had the ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

If the stop between ligand and mCherry is excised, ligand-mCherry is expressed. If the stop between receptor and eGFP is not excised, receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

But the question says they don't see any green signal. So perhaps even the receptor isn't expressed. Which would imply that both stops are not excised. But why would that be? Because if the Cre can't cut both stops.

Wait, the ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry: it's a loxP stop cassette. The receptor's stop is a lox2272 stop cassette. So wild-type Cre can cut the ligand's stop, but not the receptor's. So ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but receptor-eGFP would not.

Therefore, in the mouse, you'd see mCherry (red) but not eGFP (green). But the question says they don't see green, but the Western blot showed the proteins were expressed. Wait, but in the mouse, the expression is only in neural crest cells. If the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the receptor's stop isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But the options don't mention this. So I must have made a mistake in looking at the options.

Wait, let me look again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Maybe this refers to the fact that the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated. But I thought the eGFP is a separate ORF, so it shouldn't matter about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the fusion construct is such that the eGFP is in the same frame, but without the stop being excised, it's not expressed. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, the only one that could align with our earlier conclusion is option D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. But why is that? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

But since the options don't mention this, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming that the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, leading to a frame shift.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed such that the eGFP is out of frame, so when the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is using a stop cassette that isn't compatible with the Cre used, so the receptors aren't expressed. So that's the issue.

But since none of the options directly state this, perhaps the intended answer is option D. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another angle: when the vector is transfected into the cells, the stop cassettes are between the ORFs and the fluorescent tags. So without Cre, the tags aren't expressed. But the Western blot detected the proteins, which implies that the tags are somehow expressed. Wait, perhaps the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor, not the tags. So the Western blot detected the presence of ligand and receptor proteins, meaning the stop cassettes were somehow not effective. But that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientation, so that the proteins are expressed regardless of Cre. But that's not the case.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the setup, the most likely issue is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the receptor's stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. But since this isn't an option, I must have misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up so that the stop cassettes are in the same lox sites, but the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because it's in a different frame, leading to a premature stop codon.

But the question says the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3', fused to eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed as a separate ORF. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is a separate ORF, so the stop being present would prevent it. But if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. But with Cre, it should be.

I think I've spent too much time on this. The most plausible option is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being excised because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly state this.

Wait, looking again at the options, option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. If the enhancer was missing, then even with the stops excised, the genes wouldn't be expressed. But the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so enhancer might not be the issue.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is in a loxP site, and the Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is active in the right cells, but the vector is not designed correctly.

Wait, another thought: the lox sites are loxP and lox2272, which are different. So the same Cre can't cut both. The ligand's stop is in loxP, which Cre can cut, so ligand is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre cannot cut, so receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer is likely because the Cre can't cut both stops, but none of the options mention this.

But none of the options seem to fit. So perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in the same frame, leading to no expression. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated because it's in a different frame. So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the vector is designed such that the eGFP is under a promoter that isn't activated, but that's not the case.

In conclusion, the most likely reason is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 stop cassette, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. Since none of the options mention this, I'll have to choose the closest option, which might be D. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector is transfected into primary astrocytes, and Western blot confirms protein expression. However, when the mouse model homozygous for the construct is crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette upstream.  
   - The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream.  
   - Cre recombinase is expected to excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

2. **Cre Activity**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.  
   - Wild-type Cre can recognize and excise loxP sites but cannot recognize or excise lox2272 sites.  

3. **Observed Outcome**:  
   - In the mouse model, no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed, indicating that the receptor-eGFP construct is not being expressed.  
   - Western blot after transfection showed protein expression, suggesting the construct is functional but not active in the mouse.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship)**:  
  This option is irrelevant to the issue. The question focuses on expression in the same cell (autocrine interaction), not paracrine signaling.  

- **Option B (Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi)**:  
  If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, the Western blot confirmed protein expression, suggesting proper processing and transport.  

- **Option C (Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing)**:  
  The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the IRES ensures expression of the receptor. There is no evidence to suggest an enhancer is missing or nonfunctional.  

- **Option D (Receptor and eGFP are not in the frame)**:  
  This option implies a translational issue where the eGFP is not properly expressed due to a frame shift or misalignment. However, the more likely explanation is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by wild-type Cre, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. Since this option is the closest to addressing the issue of eGFP expression, it is the most plausible choice among those provided.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of green fluorescence is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by wild-type Cre, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. While this issue is not explicitly stated in the options, **Option D** is the closest match, as it indirectly addresses the failure of eGFP expression.

Answer: D
