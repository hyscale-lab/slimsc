Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, right, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/distance, but I think it's actually plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance is bigger, the parallax is smaller. Got it.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, so N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/distance, substituting that in, we get N proportional to (distance)^5. Because 1/(1/distance)^5 is distance^5. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it mathematically. Let's define N as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is equal to 1/d, where d is the distance. So substituting plx, N becomes proportional to (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance in per unit range. Wait, not exactly. The question says, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps it's about the density, or the rate of change of stars with distance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to model it. Let's say N is the number of stars in the region. The number of stars per unit volume or something? Or perhaps it's the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. Hmm, that's another approach. In astronomy, when you count stars at a certain distance, you're looking at a thin spherical shell. The number of stars in such a shell would depend on the volume of the shell and the density of stars at that distance.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is given by the density of stars (number per unit volume) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πr² dr. So if the density is constant, the number of stars would go as r squared times dr. But here, the density isn't constant; it's varying with parallax.

In the problem, it's given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So substituting d = r, N ∝ r^5. But wait, N is the number of stars in a region. If the region is a volume element, then the number of stars increases as r^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Maybe it's about the number per unit distance, which would be dN/dr.

Wait, let's think again. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 and plx = 1/r, then N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. So the number of stars in a region at distance r is proportional to r^5. But if we're looking at how the number changes as we move along the distance (like per unit distance), we can think of it as the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr would be the change in the number of stars per unit change in distance. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Another way to think about it: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^5. So if I increase the distance by a small amount dr, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to r^5 dr. Hmm, but the question is about how the number (per unit range) changes. So per unit r, the number is proportional to r^5. Because it's like N = (some coefficient) * r^5 * dr. So per unit dr, the number per dr is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r to some power. Let's see the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So according to my reasoning, the number increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region per unit distance should be proportional to r^5. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but I might be getting confused between the number in a shell and the number in a volume. If the number in a shell is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance (dr) would be N ∝ r^5, so the correct option is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the density of stars as a function of distance. But the given relation is the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases rapidly with r. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^5. So the answer is B.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the relation. This gives \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

To interpret how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), we consider the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \) is proportional to \( r^5 \), and per unit distance (\( \text{d}r \)), the number of stars is also proportional to \( r^5 \). This aligns with the given relation \( N \propto r^5 \).

The options provided are:

- **A)** \( \sim r^3 \)
- **B)** \( \sim r^5 \)
- **C)** \( \sim r^4 \)
- **D)** \( \sim r^2 \)

Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the correct answer is **B**.
