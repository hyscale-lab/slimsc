Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. Right, but wait, in this case, there are three solutions involved: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I guess I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base and see how they react.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So for H2SO4, each mole can react with two moles of base. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and is dihydroxide, so each mole can provide two hydroxide ions. Hmm, so the reaction would involve the acids and the base neutralizing each other.

Let me get the molarity and volumes right. The problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. I'll calculate the moles for each.

Starting with HCl:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters → moles = M × liters
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole can provide 2 H+ ions. So the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait a second, but when you mix acids and bases, the H+ from all acids will react with the OH- from the base. So the total H+ is from both HCl and H2SO4.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization reaction will depend on which is in excess. Let's see: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here; all OH- will be neutralized, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the neutralization will proceed as: H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of H2O and releases heat.

So the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, and same for OH-. So the heat released would be based on 0.2 moles.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of reaction. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy is approximately -57 kJ/mol (since 1 cal ≈4.184 J, but units might be kcal here, so I need to check the options).

Wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let's see, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about 57 kJ/mol, but since the problem combines multiple acids and a base, maybe I need to calculate the total based on the moles.

Alternatively, I might have to think about the stoichiometry of each acid with the base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. When it reacts with a base like Ba(OH)2, which is dibasic, you get a reaction where one mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2. Because H2SO4 can donate two H+ and Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- per formula unit.

So for each mole of H2SO4, it can react with one mole of Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O.

That's a neutralization reaction, and it releases enthalpy. The amount of heat per mole would be similar to other neutralizations, but maybe I need to find the enthalpy change per mole of H2SO4 or per mole of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic acid. So each mole of HCl can donate one H+. So when neutralized by Ba(OH)2, which donates two OH- per mole, the HCl can react with part of the base.

Let me break this down:

First, determine how much of each acid reacts with the base.

The total OH- available is 0.2 moles.

H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+ (since each mole gives 2, but 0.09 moles times 2 is 0.18). Each mole of H2SO4 can provide 2 H+, so for each mole reacted, two OH- are needed. So for the OH- to react with H2SO4, the moles would be:

Each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of OH-.

So, how much OH- is needed for all H2SO4?

H2SO4 has 0.09 moles, so it needs 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

We have 0.2 moles of OH- available. So after neutralizing H2SO4, how much OH- is left?

0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 moles of OH- left.

So, the H2SO4 will react completely with 0.18 moles of OH-, but wait, no: wait, the H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles of H+, which would require 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, because each mole of H+ requires a mole of OH-, right? So the H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+, and the HCl contributes 0.1 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28. The OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- will react with H+ until it's used up. So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So, which H+ comes first? Well, the strong acid HCl and the strong base H2SO4 (since H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second might be weaker, but in aqueous solution, it's usually considered strong for the first H+).

But in any case, the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So the OH- will react with the H+ until it's all used up. So the reaction will involve 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- forming H2O.

But wait, which H+ are reacting? Perhaps the strongest acids (HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is strong in first dissociation but second is weak). Hmm, but I think in this context, it's assumed all H+ from both acids are available for neutralization.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and 0.08 H+ will remain.

The enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react, which is 0.2.

If the enthalpy of neutralization is 57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each H+ + OH- → H2O releases 57 kJ), then the total heat released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but some sources say the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about 57 kJ per mole of H+. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as 57 kJ per mole of acid, but for H2SO4, the first H+ is about 57 kJ, the second might be around 19 kJ because the second dissociation is weaker (but if the base is strong, perhaps both H+ are neutralized, so each would contribute their respective enthalpy).

Wait, but in this problem, since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, when it reacts with a base that can provide two OH- per formula unit (like Ba(OH)2), each mole of H2SO4 can react with one mole of Ba(OH)2, releasing two moles of water and enthalpy.

So, the reaction would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is typically about 2 * 57 kJ (since each H+ gives off 57 kJ), but wait, no, because for the first H+ it's 57 kJ, and the second might be less. Alternatively, the overall enthalpy for this reaction is considered, which I believe is approximately -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4 (since two H+ are neutralized, each at about 57 kJ).

Wait, but how is that handled when mixing different acids and a base? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then find out how much neutralization occurs. The limiting reagent will be the one that runs out first.

So, initial step: calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since it's diprotic, initial H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each provides 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ and OH- will react 1:1. So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 mol (since OH- is 0.2). Wait, no, because the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and 0.08 H+ will remain.

So the neutralization reaction is between 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Each mole of H+ + OH- → H2O releases about 57 kJ (if using kJ, or 13.66 kcal, since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ).

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of units. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to confirm the correct unit.

If the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately 57 kJ per mole, then 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, but 57 kJ is about 13.66 kcal, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is 57 /4.184 ≈13.62 kcal. So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *13.62 ≈2.72 kcal.

But wait, no, because 57 kJ is per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ, which would be 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option A: -2.72 kcal

Option B: -11.42 kcal

Option C: -3.80 kcal

Option D: -16.0 kJ.

Wait, 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ, which is approximately 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change would be -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match, B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 11.42 kcal, which is around 48.2 kJ (since 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈48.1 kJ). That doesn't align with our 11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that all the H2SO4 may not have fully reacted if the OH- is limited. So let me think about the neutralization steps.

H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, but if the OH- is insufficient to neutralize both, only the first H+ will be neutralized. But in this case, we have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Wait, but H2SO4 provides 0.18 H+. So the OH- can neutralize 0.2 H+. So 0.18 H+ comes from H2SO4, and 0.02 from HCl (since 0.1 HCl H+ is 0.1, but we only need 0.02 more to reach 0.2 H+).

So the H2SO4 contributes all its H+ (0.18 mol) to neutralization, and the HCl contributes 0.02 mol.

But wait, in that case, the H+ reacting is 0.2 mol, as earlier.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait another thing: since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second H+ may not be as strong. So when we calculate the enthalpy, the first H+ from H2SO4 may contribute 57 kJ/mol, but the second might contribute less, say about 19 kJ/mol.

But in this scenario, all the OH- is used up, so perhaps not all H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized.

Wait, but the H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+. If we have 0.2 OH-, then all of H2SO4's H+ (0.18) would be neutralized, and then 0.02 H+ from HCl would also be neutralized.

So net H+ neutralized is 0.2, same as before.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the enthalpy for H2SO4's neutralization is different. Let me think: for H2SO4, the first neutralization (to form HSO4^-) releases about 57 kJ, and the second (to form SO4^2-) releases about 19 kJ. So if only the first H+ is neutralized (if OH- is insufficient), then the enthalpy would be 57 kJ per mole of H2SO4. But in this case, the OH- is sufficient to neutralize all H+ from H2SO4 and some from HCl.

Wait, no. Let's think step by step.

First, all the OH- will react with H+. So:

Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to form water. The order doesn't matter; the total H+ and OH- will determine the extent.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

So 0.2 H+ (from both HCl and H2SO4) react with 0.2 OH-.

The other 0.08 H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) remain.

So the enthalpy change is based on 0.2 moles of H+ *57 kJ/mol =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but some sources say that for diprotic acids, the first neutralization releases about 57 kJ and the second about 19 kJ. But in this case, all the OH- is used up, which is 0.2 moles. So if the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18, and from HCl is 0.1, then the OH- of 0.2 can take all of the H2SO4's H+ (0.18) and 0.02 from HCl. So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2.

But is each H+ giving 57 kJ? Or is the first H+ from H2SO4 giving 57, and the second from HCl (monoprotic) giving 57 as well.

Alternatively, maybe HCl's H+ is 57, and H2SO4's first H+ is 57, and the second is 19. So in this scenario, we're using 0.18 H+ from H2SO4. So 0.18*(57/2) because each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+? Wait, no, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the total enthalpy is calculated based on the moles of H+ neutralized regardless of the source. So each H+ gives 57 kJ, regardless of the acid it came from. So 0.2 moles *57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be the answer.

But wait, another possibility: the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different. Let's think about the reaction.

H2SO4 (strong) reacts with Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy for this reaction is known. Let me recall, the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 (completely neutralizing both H+ ions) is about -114 kJ per mole (since two H+ each releasing 57 kJ → 2 *57=114). But in this case, perhaps only part of the H2SO4 is neutralized.

Wait, but in our problem, the available OH- is 0.2, which can only neutralize 0.1 moles of H2SO4 (since each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of OH-). Hmm, wait, no.

Each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 moles of H+. To neutralize all H+ from H2SO4, you need 2 moles of OH- per mole of H2SO4.

So with 0.2 moles of OH-, how many moles of H2SO4 can be neutralized? Let's compute.

Each mole of H2SO4 needs 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of H2SO4 that can be fully neutralized = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 moles.

But we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4. So all of the H2SO4 can be neutralized, requiring 0.09 *2 =0.18 moles of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- is 0.2 -0.18= 0.02 moles.

Then, the HCl can react with the remaining 0.02 moles of OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 moles of H+. So 0.02 moles of H+ (from HCl) will react with 0.02 OH-.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.18 (from H2SO4) +0.02 (from HCl) =0.2.

Thus, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy of neutralization is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches.

Wait, but the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization". Enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of reaction, but in this case, the total reaction is based on the available moles. So the total heat released would be 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole contributes 1 mole of H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \implies 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes 2 moles of H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \implies 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

3. **Calculate total moles of H⁺**:  
   \[
   \text{Total H⁺} = 0.1 \, \text{(from HCl)} + 0.18 \, \text{(from H₂SO₄)} = 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

4. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a dibasic base, so each mole contributes 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \implies 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}.
   \]

5. **Determine limiting reagent**:  
   The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is 1:1. Since there are 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.2 moles of OH⁻, all 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H⁺ unreacted.

6. **Calculate enthalpy change**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately **-57 kJ per mole of H⁺ neutralized**.  
   \[
   \text{Total enthalpy change} = 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kcal (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ):  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

7. **Match with options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy change of **-2.72 kcal** matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
