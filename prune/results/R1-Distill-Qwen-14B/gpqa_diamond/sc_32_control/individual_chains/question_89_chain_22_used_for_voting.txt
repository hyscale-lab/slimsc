Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question involves several reactions, and I need to track what happens at each step to figure out the final NMR of product 3. Let's break it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. 

Step 1: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I think this might be an elimination reaction because when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane's structure—Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent bridgeheads, right? So when KOH is used, it's likely a double elimination. Each Br would leave, and the base would abstract protons, leading to formation of a double bond. But wait, wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is used, each Br is eliminated, but bridgeheads can't have double bonds because of Bredt's rule. Hmm, wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bridged bicyclic systems. Oh, but adamantane is a large, stable structure. Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridge is more than two carbons, so maybe a bridgehead double bond is possible. Or perhaps elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. But KOH is a base, not a nucleophile here. So more likely elimination. So what product would we get? If both Br are eliminated, maybe we form a diene? Or perhaps each elimination occurs separately.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with excess KOH. When a dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons) is treated with a strong base, it typically undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But in this case, the two Br are on 1 and 3 positions. So let's imagine the structure: the adamantane has four bridgeheads. Positions 1 and 3 are adjacent, perhaps on the same face. So when KOH is added, each Br would eliminate, maybe leading to the formation of a double bond between two bridgehead carbons. But wait, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds aren't allowed in small bicyclic systems, but adamantane is a tricyclic system, maybe more stable. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination doesn't form a double bond but instead forms an epoxide? No, that's when there's a peracid involved. Or maybe it's an elimination leading to a cyclopropane? Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double E2 elimination, each Br leaves, and each H is abstracted, leading to two double bonds? But that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons. Wait, 1 and 3 in adamantane may not be adjacent. Maybe I should draw the structure.

Adamantane has a structure with four bridgehead carbons in a chair-like arrangement. Positions 1 and 3 are on opposite bridgeheads. Wait, perhaps they are across from each other, but I'm not entirely sure. If that's the case, elimination of both Br could lead to a diene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. The other peaks are 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Wait, product 1 is formed after KOH treatment. So if the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, how does KOH lead to a ketone? Oh, wait, I might have gotten the reaction wrong. Maybe it's not elimination but dehydrohalogenation followed by some tautomerism or ring opening. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait, if the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH removes H and Br in E2 mechanism, but perhaps in this case, each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, maybe it's a di elimination, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with KOH, sometimes they form alcohols via single elimination (like in the case of vicinal dihalides forming an epoxide, but no, that's with Hg(OAc)2). Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution. For instance, each Br could be replaced by OH, but that would give 1,3-diol. But the IR here shows a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which is a carbonyl, so maybe not.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can form an alkene. But if elimination occurs, perhaps each Br leaves, but the structure doesn't allow for a double bond, so maybe the product is a cyclopropane? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The product's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet). That's usually indicative of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps an alcohol. Wait, considering the IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is an ketone. But how?

Wait, another angle. Maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that's when a peroxide is involved, like H2O2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether. But the triplet in the NMR at 4.79 ppm could be for an ether. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are around 3-4 ppm as a triplet if adjacent to an oxygen. But wait, the 4.79 is a triplet for 2H. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR spectrum again. Product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 (2H). That suggests maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or an ester. The other peaks are in the 2.4-2.23 region (10H) and 1.94 (2H). The 2.4-2.2 could be multiple CH2 groups in a rigid structure, perhaps the adamantane skeleton. The 1.94 is 2H, maybe another CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the IR peak of 1720 cm-¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How can elimination of two Br atoms in KOH produce a carbonyl?

Wait a minute! Maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, another possibility: when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and KOH is present, perhaps the two bromides are eliminated to form a carbonyl group. Wait, elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons would form a double bond, but that doesn't form a carbonyl. Unless it's a keto-enol type situation.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. What if the initial elimination is to form a carbonyl via a peroxide-like mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alkyne, but the IR doesn't fit that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? If the two Br are on adjacent carbons, and each is eliminated with base, perhaps the two carbons would each lose a Br and a H, leading to a double bond. But that doesn't form a carbonyl. Unless there's some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the NMR would show different peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether. But I'm not seeing the connection to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone formed via a different mechanism. Let me think, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a nucleophilic attack, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps when the two Br are eliminated, the structure forms a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely from a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Maybe an epoxide? Epoxides usually show protons in around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet if adjacent to another CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, like an epoxide. But why would the IR show a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester or a ketone. But I'm not sure how the KOH would produce that.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But if the structure is such that when both Br are replaced with something, perhaps OH groups, but that would give a diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Oh! Wait, no. Another possibility: the heating with KOH could be a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The product has an IR peak at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone or an ester. Let's say it's a ketone.

So I'm thinking, how do you form a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules, but forming a double bond. But that doesn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else. Wait, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a diketone. But how? If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require oxidation. KOH isn't an oxidizing agent though. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double E2 elimination, but in such a way that each Br is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl? I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead and elimination leads to formation of a carbonyl. Wait, if a bridgehead H is abstracted and the Br leaves, perhaps leading to a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a C-O-C structure adjacent to a double bond, and their protons are around 4-5 ppm. But the IR would show a carbonyl, but enol ethers don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. But I don't see the connection.

I think I need to look for other clues. The NMR of product 1 has 2H as a triplet at 4.79 ppm. That's in the range of an ether or an ester. For example, ethyl groups adjacent to oxygen. The 10H in 2.4-2.23 ppm suggests CH2 groups in a rigid structure, maybe the adamantane framework. The 2H at 1.94 could be another CH2 group, perhaps part of a bridge.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form 1,3-adamantanone. Wait, is that possible? How? Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, could lose two HBr molecules to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But would that happen?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. If each Br is replaced by elimination, perhaps forming a conjugated diene. But again, that's not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm. Maybe I should move forward and see if the next steps give me any clues.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst. It's commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a ketone, perhaps the reaction is Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but product 1 needs to have a carbonyl group to act as an acylium ion source. Wait, yes, product 1 has a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is the acylation of another aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, it could undergo some kind of alkylation if it's an aromatic ring, but adamantane isn't aromatic.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an alcohol, but the IR suggests a carbonyl, which is a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone and then treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of ring expansion or another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane with a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But since the bridgehead can't form a double bond, perhaps the structure rearranges. Maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure with a double bond. For example, 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminating two HBr to form a bridged diene. But then, how does that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, causing each Br to leave as Br⁻, and the carbons to form a double bond. But that's a diene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next step for clues. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, going back, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which has a double bond. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Al(OiPr)3 is part of an elimination reaction to form a double bond. But product 1 has a carbonyl, not a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but product 1 has a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, how would Al(OiPr)3 be used? Maybe it's used as a catalyst for some kind of addition or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is more likely a ketone than an alcohol. So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else with a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but I thought the IR suggested a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination where each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give a diol. Then, the diol (product 1) would be treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps leading to elimination of water to form a double bond, making product 2. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into carbonyl groups.

But let's see. If product 1 is a diol, then product 2 would have a double bond. Let me see: diol (product 1) → upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 (a strong Lewis acid), perhaps it loses water to form a double bond (dehydration), making an alkene. So product 2 is the alkene. Then, ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But let's connect this back to the initial reaction. If product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), then its NMR would show peaks for OH groups, but in the given NMR, there's no broad peak around 1-5 ppm which would indicate OH protons. So perhaps product 1 is not a diol, which makes this line of thought incorrect.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. An epoxide would have protons in the 3-4 ppm region. But the given NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is higher. So perhaps not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone and an adjacent group. So product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is perhaps an enol ether (with a double bond), and then ozonolysis would break that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Wait, but the IR of 1720 could be an ester as well. Let me think: if product 1 is an ester, then treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could be part of a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But adamantane isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is converted into an acylium ion, which could undergo some cycloaddition or other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. If product 1 is 1,3-diol, then heating with Al(OiPr)3, a strong dehydrating agent, would cause elimination of water to form a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyls.

But in the NMR of product 1, there's no peak that suggests an OH group. So maybe the diol is not the case.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone adjacent to an ether group. For example, if two Br are eliminated to form a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an enolate, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should try to find a possible structure for product 1. Let's think about the NMR of product 1:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet): likely an -O-CH2- group.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H): perhaps 5 sets of CH2 groups in adamantane.
- 1.94 (2H): maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something.

IR: 1720 cm-1 ⇒ carbonyl, likely a ketone.

So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone with some substituents. But how does that structure fit with the NMR?

Wait, 1,3-adamantanone would have a ketone group, but would the NMR show a triplet at 4.79 ppm? No, because adamantane's structure doesn't have protons near the ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe product 1 is a substituted adamantane with a carbonyl group and an adjacent oxygen.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic ether with a ketone. For example, an epoxide with a ketone nearby. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 4.79 ppm is for 2H. That's a common pattern for a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether (-O-CH2-). So perhaps product 1 is an ether with a ketone.

So, maybe product 1 is a ketone and an ether substituent. So the structure has a carbonyl and an ether oxygen.

So, moving to the next step: product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid used in dehydration reactions. So product 2 is likely an alkene formed by dehydration of an alcohol in product 1. Wait, but product 1 doesn't have an alcohol group. Unless product 1 is an ether with an alcohol group somewhere else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a hemiacetal or acetal. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 could cause ring-opening or elimination to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide with a ketone, and the Al(OiPr)3 induces some ring-opening or elimination.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was in product 2.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen (probably the most downfield) is being asked about. The options are coupling patterns: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most downfield protons are usually near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyls. So after ozonolysis, the protons adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each fragment forms a carbonyl. The adjacent protons would be on each side of the former double bond.

So, suppose the double bond in product 2 is between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, with each group attached to the remaining structure. The protons on A and B would become adjacent to carbonyls.

So, if the original double bond was between two CH2 groups, the protons on each would split into two sets, each adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the double bond was in a ring, like in a cyclic structure, the ozonolysis would break the ring into two carbonyls. So the resulting structure would have two carbonyls connected by the cleavage.

In any case, the protons near the carbonyl would likely be deshielded and appear downfield. Their coupling patterns depend on their neighboring protons.

Assuming that each of these protons is adjacent to two other protons, they might form a triplet or some other multiplet.

Wait, suppose the carbonyl is next to a CH2 group. Each of the two protons on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl and perhaps coupled with each other and with neighboring groups.

Alternatively, in a more complex structure, each proton could have multiple coupling partners, leading to more complex splitting.

But let's think about the options:

A) triplet: each proton has two neighbors, splitting into a triplet.

B) triplet of triplets: each proton is coupled to two different sets of two protons, leading to triplet of triplets.

C) doublet of triplets: one coupling of two, and another of one, but that's not a standard term. Wait, perhaps it's each proton is split into a doublet due to one coupling and a triplet due to another, so the pattern would be a doublet of triplets, which would result in six lines.

D) pentet: five peaks, perhaps due to coupling with four equivalent protons.

Hmm.

In ozonolysis, the product is typically a diketone if the double bond was in the middle of a chain. For example, if the double bond was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2's. Each CH2 would have two protons, each adjacent to a carbonyl.

Each of these protons would be split based on their neighboring protons. The CH2 group would have two protons, each adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in such a scenario, each proton would be adjacent to another proton on the same CH2, so each proton would be a doublet due to coupling with one neighboring proton. But if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl, which deshields the protons, perhaps the coupling is with two different sets.

Alternatively, if the original double bond was between two CH groups, each with two substituents, the ozonolysis would give each CH next to a carbonyl. Each of these protons would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think with an example.

Suppose the double bond is between two CH2 groups. The structure is CH2-CH2, double bond, CH2-CH2 (but in a ring, perhaps). Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, each connected to a CH2 group. So each CH2 group would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Each CH2 group's protons would be next to each other and perhaps next to another group. Wait, each CH2 has two protons. If each proton is only coupled to its adjacent proton on the same CH2, each would be a doublet. But if there are other couplings, like with protons on adjacent carbons, it could split further.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another group, like a branching point, the coupling could be more complex.

But in the options, the most likely answer is a triplet or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the original double bond in product 2 leads to each CH2 in product 3 being adjacent to two other protons. For example, if each end of the double bond is a CH2- group, then after ozonolysis, each CH2 would be connected to a carbonyl. Each CH2 group's protons would have two neighboring protons (the other in the same CH2 and maybe another from an adjacent group).

Wait, let me imagine a simple case. Let's say product 2 has a double bond like CH2-CH2. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, each connected to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two protons. Each proton would be adjacent to one other proton in the CH2, leading to a doublet. But perhaps there's another coupling, like with a neighboring CH2 group.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then each proton could have coupling with two protons (the two in the adjacent CH2). That would lead to a triplet for each proton.

Wait, for example, consider a simple diene where each end is CH2. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyls connected to CH2 groups. The two CH2 groups would be next to each other, so each CH2's protons would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the most deshielded protons (adjacent to carbonyls) would be triplets. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: each CH2 group's protons are next to each other and perhaps also next to another group with more protons, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis has each CH2 group adjacent to a CH group, which has two protons, then each proton in the CH2 would couple with two protons on the CH, leading to a triplet. But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the coupling pattern in the NMR is influenced by the number of neighboring protons. For a triplet, each proton must have two neighboring protons. If the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton in the CH2 would have two neighboring protons (the two in the adjacent CH2). So each would be a triplet.

So, if that's the case, the most deshielded proton (on the CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-Dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH at 240°C. KOH, being a strong base, likely induces elimination reactions. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., in an ether or ester). The other peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) are consistent with the adamantane framework. Thus, product 1 is likely a ketone with an ether substituent.

---

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid commonly used for dehydration reactions. This step likely converts the ketone-containing product (product 1) into an alkene (product 2) via elimination. The formation of a double bond is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step, which targets double bonds.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2, containing a double bond, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby protons.

---

### Step 4: Coupling Pattern in Product 3
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Its coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, it will couple with two protons, resulting in a triplet. This is consistent with the splitting observed in the NMR spectrum.

---

### Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with a hydrogen adjacent to two equivalent protons (e.g., in a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group).  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is unlikely in this case.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one proton and another set of two protons, which does not fit the expected structure.  
- **D) Pentagon**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not consistent with the expected splitting pattern.

---

### Conclusion
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern due to its adjacency to two equivalent protons. 

**Answer: A**
