Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about figuring out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but I remember that symmetry groups depend on the shape and structure of molecules. For example, something like CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry, while water is bent with C2v.

Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio, maybe something like A + 8B → C. What bright red compounds do I know? Maybe something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) isn't red. Oh wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound? Like maybe Cu reacting. Or perhaps it's a nitrate? Wait, another thought: maybe C is a compound like Fe(SCN)n, which is red. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could C be something like a nitro compound? Not sure.

The next part says when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E. E is produced, and it's dangerous. So what could E be? Maybe some kind of explosive or highly reactive substance.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So C + H2O → A + F + G. So the reaction is probably hydrolysis. Let's think: if C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives a strong and a weak acid. Let's say if C is a sulfite, then hydrolysis gives H2SO3 and another acid. Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: if C is something like SO3, then hydrolysis would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and what else? Hmm, wait, no, SO3 plus water is H2SO4, but that's only one product. Maybe C is a nitrate? Wait, another approach: let's think about the acids. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, HCN, H3PO4 maybe.

Wait, another angle: looking at the other reaction. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. Solvents could be something like H2O, or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but B is a gas. So if B is something like Cl2, D could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like H2O. But then what would D be? Let's think, if B is Cl2, D might be H2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, B could be H2, and D could be something else. Hmm, perhaps B is O2. Then D could be H2, so their reaction would form H2O. That makes sense as a solvent.

Wait, but let's try to piece this together. Let me try to figure out what each compound is.

Let's go step by step.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A + 8 moles of gas B → product C (bright red).

2. Reaction 2: C + 2 moles of gas D → product E (extremely hazardous).

3. Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

4. Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

Let me start with reaction 4. They form a solvent, H. Let's think about possible reactions between two gases that form a solvent. If B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O. But that's a possibility. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H is HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Hmm. Another possibility: B is CO2, D is H2O? But then H would be something else. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: H is a solvent, so maybe H is water. Then reaction 4 would be D + B → H2O. So what gases combine to form water? Probably H2 and O2. So 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio in reaction 4 is 1:1, so the stoichiometric ratio would be 2:1 for H2 and O2. But in reaction 4, it's 1:1. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O? No, because B is a gas. So if B is H2O, but that's a liquid under standard conditions. So perhaps B is something else.

Alternatively, maybe reaction 4 produces H2O. Let's think: if D is H2 and B is O2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So for every 1 mole of O2, 2 moles of H2 are needed. So the ratio is 1:2, but reaction 4 is in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 D + B → 2 H. So if H is H2O, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1 (H2 to O2). But reaction 4 is 1:1. So this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H isn't water. Maybe it's another solvent like ethanol or something. But if B and D are gases, their reaction would need to form a liquid.

Wait, another approach: maybe H is NH3, as it's a common solvent. Then reaction 4 would be D + B → NH3. But what gases would react to form NH3? Maybe N2 and H2. But the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So the ratio is 1:3, but reaction 4 is 1:1. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is NH3. No, because D is a gas, and if B is another gas, their combination would need to form a solvent. Maybe D is O2 and B is H2, but again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

This part is a bit tricky. Maybe I should try to figure out reaction 3, which involves C reacting with water to form A, F, and G. Since F is a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps C is something that hydrolyzes into two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a sulfite (SO3^2-), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. Wait, when nitrates react with water, they usually don't hydrolyze to produce acids. Another thought: maybe C is a metal sulfide? Like FeS? No, because FeS reacting with water might not produce strong and weak acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound? Or maybe it's a chloro compound. Alternatively, maybe C is something like SO3. Let me think: if C is SO3, reacting with water would produce H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But where does the weak acid come in? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, if A is a metal, and B is oxygen or something. Let me think, suppose A is Fe, and B is O2. So Fe + 8 O2 → FeO4 or something. But FeO4 isn't a common compound. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, so S + 8 O2 → SO8, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal complex. For example, maybe the bright red product is something like Fe(SCN)3. That's a possibility because potassium ferricyanide is bright red. Wait, but ferricyanide is K3Fe(CN)6, which is red. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: the extremely hazardous product E. What's a very dangerous substance? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's not extremely hazardous in what way?

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio, maybe D is a strong oxidizing agent. Or perhaps E is a product of a decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think of C as a nitrate. For example, if C is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a brown gas, but the product C is bright red, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's think: if A is a metal, B is oxygen. So reaction A + 8 B → C (bright red). So metal + O2 → oxide. For example, say A is iron. Iron can form FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3. Fe2O3 is reddish, so maybe C is Fe2O3. Then, when Fe2O3 reacts with D (a gas), perhaps D is a strong acid like HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, if D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides are usually not red. Wait, maybe it's a polyatomic ion. Like MnO4^- is purple, but maybe not red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Wait, maybe C is sodium nitrate, but that's not red. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at reaction 3, C + H2O → A + F + G. Let's think of a reaction where a compound upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe another acid? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate ester. Let's say C is something like CH3ONO (nitromethane). No, that's a liquid, not a solid.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to think of common bright red products. Oh! I remember that lead dioxide is bright brown, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is mercuric oxide, which is red. Wait, mercuric oxide is HgO, which is red. So A could be mercury metal, and B is oxygen. So Hg + O2 → HgO. But in the reaction, 8 equivalents of B would be involved. So Hg + 8 O2 → HgO? That doesn't make sense because the typical reaction is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 HgO. Hmm, perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a nitro compound, like HNO3. But HNO3 is colorless. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange or yellow, but I'm thinking maybe not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal carbonyl. For example, Ni(CO)4 is a liquid, not solid. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal chloride. For example, CoCl2 is blue, but maybe not red.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonamide? I'm not sure about colors.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that's red. Like maybe FeO is black, Fe2O3 is reddish. So perhaps C is Fe2O3. Then A would be Fe metal, B would be O2.

So Reaction 1: Fe + 8 O2 → Fe2O3? Wait, the balanced equation for iron oxide would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 3 equivalents of O2 per Fe. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a higher oxide. For example, if A is lead, Pb, and it reacts with oxygen to form PbO2, which is dark brown. But not bright red.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright yellow, so no.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitroprusside complex, which is red. Sodium nitroprusside is bright red. So perhaps C is KFe[Fe(CN)6]NO, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe C is a product like Fe(SCN)n, perhaps Fe(SCN)3. Ferric thiocyanate is a deep red. So if C is Fe(SCN)3, then A could be Fe metal, and B is SCN^- (but SCN is a solution, not a gas). Hmm, that doesn't fit because B is a gas.

Wait, perhaps B is a gas like Cl2. So if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But FeCl3 is yellow, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is Cl2, so Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2, which is green. Not red.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should move on to other parts and see if that helps.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but in that case, D would have to be something that reacts with C to form HCN. Alternatively, perhaps E is a product like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe E is a explosive compound. Like nitroglycerin, but that's a liquid.

Wait, another angle: the product E is extremely hazardous, so it might be something like sarin gas or VX, but I don't think that's relevant here. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive acid like H2SO4, but that would require C to react with something like SO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about reaction 4 again. D + B form H, a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is water (H2O). Then D and B must be H2 and O2. But reaction 4 is 1:1, so for example, 1 mole D and 1 mole B → 2 moles H (H2O). So, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But in that case, the ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1. So in reaction 4, it's 2 D + B → 2 H. So the ratio is 2:1, but in the problem, it's 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless the reaction is O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O, which would require 2 moles of H2 for every mole of O2. So the ratio in reaction 4 would be 2:1, which doesn't match the 1:1 given. So perhaps H isn't water.

Another thought: what about H being NH3? Then D and B would need to be N2 and H2. The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So the ratio is 1:3. Again, not matching the 1:1 ratio in reaction 4.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 D + B → H, but in a 1:1 ratio. So for example, if D is H2 and B is O2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2 moles D and 1 mole B → 2 H. So the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe H is CH4. Then what would D and B be? Maybe CO and H2? But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from B and D as gases? Maybe CO2 and H2 → CH3OH? Doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to think of E. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's something like H2S, but that's not extremely hazardous, just toxic. Alternatively, maybe E is a radioactive substance, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone. Ozone is a strong oxidizer and can be dangerous. So if E is O3, then C + 2 D → O3. What is D? Ozone is formed from O2 and some other reaction. Wait, but O3 is made from O2 and light, but that's not a reaction with another gas. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and E is O3, but that would require a catalyst or UV light, not a stoichiometric reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. So if E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN. What's D? Then D could be something like CH3CN, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Or perhaps D is NH3 and C is something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is something like Cl2O7, which is a highly oxidizing and toxic compound. Then, C + 2 D → Cl2O7. But I'm not sure what C and D would be.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of E as a product of a decomposition reaction. For example, maybe C is a nitro compound that decomposes into nitric acid and something else. But I'm not making progress.

Let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about the symmetry groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a molecule with a certain symmetry, which of these makes sense?

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. So a molecule like H2O has C2v symmetry, which is one of the options. But wait, H2O has a bent structure and is in C2v.

D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with inversion. For example, O2, CO2, and HCN have D∞h symmetry.

D4h is the symmetry of a molecule like SO2, which is trigonal pyramidal but has a certain symmetry.

C2v is for molecules like H2O, which have a C2 axis and two mirror planes.

So if E is a linear molecule, it could be D∞h or C2v (if it's non-linear but has a C2 axis and mirror planes).

Wait, but what's the structure of E? If E is O3 (ozone), it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis, so symmetry group would be C2v. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, it would be D∞h.

Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if E is something like phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2, it's a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry. But that's speculative.

But given the options, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 or O2, symmetry group is D∞h. If E is a bent molecule like H2O or O3, then it's C2v. If it's a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like NH3 (but NH3 is trigonal pyramidal with C3v symmetry, which isn't one of the options), then perhaps another molecule.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But earlier, I thought E is a product of C and D. Let me think again.

If E is O2, then that would mean C + 2 D → O2. That would imply that C and D are some compounds that, upon reaction, release O2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, which has C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product with a different structure.

But without knowing what E is, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of a decomposition reaction. For example, if C is a nitrate, then perhaps D is a reducing agent, and E is a nitric oxide or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a peroxide. Peroxides have O-O bonds. For example, H2O2 has C2v symmetry because it's bent.

Wait, H2O2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, so its symmetry group is C2v. So if E were H2O2, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But is E a peroxide? Let me think. If C is a nitrate, and D is a reducing agent like H2S, then maybe C + 2 H2S → E (like producing H2O2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, and D is a reducing agent leading to the formation of H2O2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of the decomposition of a nitrate. For example, some nitrates decompose to form oxygen and other products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like H2O2, which is a strong oxidizer and can be dangerous. So if E is H2O2, then its symmetry group is C2v.

Alternatively, another molecule with C2v symmetry is H2O itself, but E is a product of C and D.

Wait, but another approach: looking back at reaction 3, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak.

If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, then hydrolyzing it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but the problem says F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2. Then, hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and Ca(OH)2, but that's a base. Hmm, but the problem says F and G are acids, so this might not fit.

Wait, maybe C is a phosphate. For example, if C is Ca3(PO4)2, then hydrolysis would produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (base again). Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Then hydrolysis would produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and maybe a base. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like RSO3R', then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 and the corresponding alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is nitrobenzene, then hydrolysis would require specific conditions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is an ester. Esters hydrolyze to form carboxylic acids and alcohols. So if C is an ester, then F could be a strong acid (like HCl if it's an alkyl chloro ester) and G a weak acid (like acetic acid). But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, it produces A (same as the original solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two acids. For example, perhaps C is a mixed salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water (H2O) might not produce two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a dithiocarbamate. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures.

Let me try to outline possible compounds:

- If C is a nitrate, like KNO3, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and KOH (strong base). But the problem says two acids, so this doesn't fit.

- If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not two acids.

- If C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, hydrolysis gives H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not two acids.

- Maybe C is a phosphate ester. For example, if C is trimethyl phosphate, (CH3O)3P=O. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and methanol (which isn't an acid). So that gives one acid and one alcohol, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of compound. For example, if C is a chloro compound. Let's say C is CH2Cl2, but that's a solvent and wouldn't hydrolyze to acids.

Another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is FeO, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2O. But that's not two acids.

Alternatively, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2, then hydrolysis would produce O2 and NaOH, which isn't two acids.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to think of the possible answers and see which symmetry group matches.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2, the symmetry is D∞h (option B). If E is a bent molecule like H2O, it's C2v (option D). If E is a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis but no mirror planes, it would be C2 (option A). D4h is for a molecule with four-fold rotation and a mirror plane, like SO2.

So which of these makes sense for E?

If E is a product of a reaction that produces a linear molecule, like CO2, then D∞h would be the symmetry group.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is bent, the symmetry is C2v.

But without knowing what E is, it's tough. Let me think about possible reactions.

Another approach: since E is produced from C and D in a 2:1 ratio, perhaps D is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2.

Wait, let me think about D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O. So D and B must be H2 and O2. So D is H2, B is O2.

So reaction 4: H2 + O2 → H2O. But the ratio is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, so the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then D and B would be N2 and H2, but the stoichiometry is 1:3, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is CH4, and D and B are C and H2. But that would require a 1:3 ratio for CH4, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Maybe H is CO2, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. How would that form from B and D as gases? Maybe from CO2 and H2, but that would require more H2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe reaction 4 is simply H2O, despite the stoichiometry not matching. Let's assume that D is H2, B is O2, and H is H2O. Then, the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. Maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed.

So, B is O2, D is H2.

Now, going back to reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So A is a solid reacting with O2 to form a bright red product. That suggests A is a metal that forms a red oxide. For example, perhaps A is copper, but copper oxide is black. Alternatively, maybe A is lead, but PbO2 is dark brown.

Wait, perhaps A is vanadium. V(III) oxide is green, V(IV) is yellow, V(V) is orange. Not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is manganese. MnO2 is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: A is sulfur. Sulfur (S8) reacts with O2 to form SO2 (colorless) or SO3 (colorless). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange. But I'm not sure about red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese(II) or manganese(III) compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of A with 8 equivalents of B to form C. So the formula might be A B8 → C.

If B is O2, then the formula of C would be A O8. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps C is AO4, and 8 O2 would mean 16 O atoms, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is A O8, which would be a very high oxidation state. For example, if A is Fe, then FeO8 doesn't make sense. Not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a polyatomic ion. For example, if A is a metal, and B is a halogen, then perhaps C is a halide.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on this.

Let me try to think of another angle. Since in reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G, which are acids, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids. For example, perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. Let's say C is Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate). Then hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, C could be something like NaHSO4. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 and NaOH. Again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a diacid salt. For example, if C is Na2HPO4, hydrolysis would produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Still not two acids.

Hmm.

Another thought: maybe C is a nitro compound that upon hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe C is nitrobenzene. But nitrobenzene hydrolyzes to produce phenol (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). That fits! So in this case, reaction 3 would be nitrobenzene + H2O → phenol (G, weak acid) and HNO3 (F, strong acid) plus maybe some other products. But nitrobenzene hydrolysis typically requires acidic conditions or a catalyst, but perhaps in this problem, it's simplified.

So if C is nitrobenzene, then what's A? Nitrobenzene is C6H5NO2. So A would be C6H5NH2 (aniline), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps A is benzene, but that doesn't fit well.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another nitro compound. Let's say C is nitropropane, which upon hydrolysis would produce propionic acid (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). That would fit.

So, C is nitropropane, which upon hydrolysis gives HNO3 and propionic acid. So F is HNO3 (strong acid), G is propionic acid (weak).

If that's the case, then reaction 1 is A + 8 B → C (nitropropane). So A is propane with something. Wait, nitropropane is CH3CH2CH2NO2. So how is A related? Maybe A is propane and B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a nitro group donor. Not sure.

But this line of thinking seems to be getting somewhere. If C is nitropropane, then reaction 3 gives two acids: HNO3 and CH2CH2COOH (propionic acid).

Now, moving to reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous). If C is nitropropane, and D is something like H2, then perhaps E is propane. But that's not dangerous. Alternatively, D could be another gas, like Cl2. Then, nitropropane + Cl2 → some product. But I'm not sure what.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a reducing agent. For example, H2 and a catalyst. Then, perhaps the reaction reduces the nitro group to an amine. So E would be propane amine (like propylamine), but that's not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, and the reaction is combustion. Then, nitropropane would burn to produce CO2 and H2O, but that's not a dangerous product.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas. Like HCN. So if C is nitropropane and D is something that upon reaction produces HCN, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of decomposition, like if nitropropane decomposes to form something like HNO2, which is toxic, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on E.

But given that, perhaps I should focus on the symmetry groups.

If E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, that would be option B. Alternatively, if E is H2O, then it's C2v (option D).

Wait, another possibility: E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, which is a diatomic gas, that's possible. But why would C + 2 D → O2? That would imply that C and D are some reactants that decompose to form O2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of decomposition of a peroxide. For example, if C is H2O2, then reaction 2 could be H2O2 → H2O + O2, but that's not fitting with the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Ozone (O3), which has C2v symmetry.

In that case, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how would C and D form O3?

Ozone is formed from O2 via photochemical reactions, but that's not a stoichiometric reaction with another gas.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, and C is something that upon reaction with O2 produces O3, but that doesn't make sense as a reaction.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with a four-fold axis, like SO2, which has D4h symmetry (option B). So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group is D4h.

But how would that fit the reaction?

If C is something that upon reaction with D (a gas) produces SO2, perhaps C is a sulfite and D is something like H2O, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide and D is O2. For example, CuS + O2 → CuSO4 + SO2. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is CS2 (carbon disulfide), which has D∞h symmetry. But CS2 is a liquid, not a gas.

Hmm.

Another angle: the extremely hazardous product E. What about phosgene (COCl2)? It's a gas and highly toxic. Phosgene has a structure similar to CO2, so it would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, the symmetry group is D∞h (option B).

But how would that form? Phosgene can be produced from chlorinated carbonyl compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is sarin gas (GB), which is an organophosphorus compound, but I don't know its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas.

So if E is HCN, the symmetry group is D∞h (option B).

But how would C and D form HCN?

If C is a nitrile, like CH3CN, and D is H2O, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, and D is H+ (but H+ isn't a gas).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, and D is a strong acid, which would release HCN gas. For example, if C is NaCN and D is H2SO4, then the reaction would produce HCN. But D would have to be H2SO4, which is a liquid, not a gas. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if D is Cl2, and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form HCN, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a thiocyanate, like KSCN. Reacting with D (maybe H2O?), but I'm not certain.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the possible structures.

If E is a highly toxic gas that's linear, like HCN or phosgene, then the symmetry group is D∞h, option B. Alternatively, if E is ozone (bent), then it's C2v, option D.

But considering the options, if E is a diatomic molecule, it would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, it's C2v.

Another angle: the reaction of C with D produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Perhaps E is a product of a decomposition reaction. For example, if C is a nitro compound, and D is a reducing agent like H2, then E could be NH3, which is toxic but not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps E is NO or NO2, which are toxic.

Wait, NO is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is NO, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

So how would that fit?

If C is a nitro compound, and D is H2, then perhaps the reaction is reduction of the nitro group to nitric oxide. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, and D is a reducing agent, leading to the formation of NO.

But without more information, it's hard to pin down.

Given the options, I think the most likely symmetry group for E is D∞h, which is option B.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (8 equivalents) suggests a specific reaction ratio, and the bright red color hints at a compound like a nitro compound or a transition metal complex. However, the exact identity of C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly reactive or toxic compound, such as a gas like HCN, phosgene (COCl₂), or NO. These compounds are linear or bent and have distinct symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a hydrolyzable compound, such as a nitro compound or a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is a nitro compound like nitrobenzene, hydrolysis could yield HNO₃ (strong acid) and phenol (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests H could be water (H₂O), as it is a common solvent formed from gases like H₂ and O₂. However, the stoichiometry (1:1) does not perfectly align with the typical 2:1 ratio for H₂ and O₂ to form H₂O.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - If E is a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene, it would have **D∞h** symmetry.
   - If E is a bent molecule like ozone (O₃), it would have **C₂v** symmetry.
   - A diatomic molecule like O₂ or NO would also have **D∞h** symmetry.
   - Based on the options provided, the most likely symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, as it aligns with highly reactive or toxic linear compounds like phosgene or NO.

Given the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is most consistent with **D∞h**.
