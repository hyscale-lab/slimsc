Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty of the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right, the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, since P_z is an operator, and the state is given, I need to compute the expectation values.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation values won't necessarily be the same as the eigenvalues. I have to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ using this state.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should probably check if it's normalized. The sum of the squares should be 1.

Calculating the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's ψ† P_z ψ.

The matrix for P_z is given as:

[ ħ  0   0 ]
[ 0  0   0 ]
[ 0  0 -ħ ]

So let me write that as a matrix. P_z is a diagonal matrix.

So when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ, I can compute this as the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element, because the off-diagonal elements are zero.

Breaking it down, the state vector is [ a, b, c ] where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * (ħ a) + b* * (0 * b) + c* * (-ħ c). Since a and c are real, their complex conjugates are the same.

So it becomes ħ a² + 0 + (-ħ) c².

Plugging in a and c: a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, same for c². So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ħ*(1/4) + (-ħ)*(1/4) = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let's double-check:

a = -1/2 → a² = 1/4. So ħ*(1/4) from the first term. c = -1/2 → c² = 1/4, and it's multiplied by -ħ. So (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Yeah, that's correct.

Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared will be the same as the square of each diagonal element because it's diagonal.

So P_z² is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So again, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the same as ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Since the middle element is zero, it doesn't contribute. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = a² * ħ² + c² * ħ².

Because the middle component, b, is multiplied by zero. So:

a² is (1/2), c² is also (1/2). So (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait wait, wait. a is -1/2. So a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly for c. So a² + c² is (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2. So ⟨P_z²⟩ = 1/2 * ħ².

So now compute ΔP_z. It's sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ)/sqrt(2).

Hmm, that's option B. So the answer should be B) ħ/√2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recheck.

a = -1/2 → a squared is 0.25. c same. So 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. Multiply by ħ² → 0.5 ħ².

Yes. So the standard deviation is sqrt(0.5 ħ²) = ħ * sqrt(0.5) = ħ / sqrt(2). Which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) of the operator \( P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle P_z \rangle \)
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for \( P_z \) is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \)
The matrix for \( P_z^2 \) is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since \( \langle P_z \rangle = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
