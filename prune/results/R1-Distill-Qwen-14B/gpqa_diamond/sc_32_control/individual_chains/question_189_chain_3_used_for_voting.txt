Okay, so I'm looking at this question about particles and broken symmetries. Hmm, I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, certain particles called Goldstone bosons appear. Wait, what's a Goldstone boson again? Oh right, they're massless particles that result from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Because of the Higgs mechanism or something like that.

The question is asking which of the given particles isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Let's think about each option one by one.

Option A: Phonon. I think phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They're quasi-particles for the lattice vibrations. But phonons arise from the breaking of translational symmetry, right? Because in a solid, the lattice has a periodic structure, so the continuous translational symmetry of a liquid or gas is broken. But wait, the question is about spontaneous symmetry breaking. So phonons are Goldstone bosons for broken translational symmetry. So that would mean they are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if the question is which is NOT, then Phonon might not be the correct answer because it's associated with a broken symmetry.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological defects, right? They occur in materials like neutron stars and some magnetic materials. Skyrmions are solutions to certain field theories, like the Skyrme model. I'm not entirely sure about the symmetry aspect. Wait, Skyrmions might be associated with broken symmetry because they can represent a soliton, which is a stable particle due to some symmetry. But I think Skyrmions arise when there's a symmetry that's not completely broken, or perhaps they emerge due to the breaking of certain global symmetries. Or maybe they are related to the Pion, which I know is a Goldstone boson.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles for spin waves in a magnetically ordered system. They describe the quantized spin waves. So when a magnetic material undergoes a phase transition and orders (like ferromagnetic ordering), the symmetry is broken. The Goldstone bosons in this case would be the magnons. So magnons are associated with broken symmetry. So this can't be the answer to the question because the question is which is NOT associated.

Option D: Pion. I'm pretty sure pions are the Goldstone bosons from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in the early universe and in hadronic matter, leading to the massless pions (though they get a small mass due to other effects). So pions are definitely tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry. So D can't be the correct answer.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT associated. So the correct answer is the particle that doesn't come from a spontaneously broken symmetry.

So let me recap:

A) Phonon: yes, broken translational symmetry (so associated), so not the correct answer.

B) Skyrmion: Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Skyrmions are topological, so perhaps they arise due to a different mechanism. Wait, Skyrmions are more about the topology of the field configuration rather than arising from a broken symmetry. Or maybe they arise from the breaking of a symmetry? Let me think. In the Skyrme model, the pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking, and the Skyrmion is a soliton solution. So perhaps Skyrmions are not the Goldstone bosons themselves but are related to the topological aspects of the symmetry breaking. So perhaps Skyrmions are not directly the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking but are more about the topological structure.

Alternatively, Skyrmions could be a result of the breaking of a global symmetry. Wait, when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken, Goldstone's theorem says that massless bosons appear. However, for local symmetries, like the Higgs mechanism, the Goldstone bosons become part of the gauge bosons (mass). But Skyrmions are more about the structure of the vacuum manifold. So maybe Skyrmions aren't directly the Goldstone bosons but are solutions in the presence of a broken symmetry.

Alternatively, Skyrmions could be considered as arising from the breaking of a continuous symmetry, but perhaps they are more about the vacuum structure rather than the Goldstone bosons themselves. So in that case, Skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons but are related to the topology. So in the context of the question, which is asking about particles associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Skyrmion is not directly a Goldstone boson but arises due to some other reason.

Wait, let's think about the others. Phonons are Goldstone bosons for the breaking of translational symmetry in solids. Magnons are for the broken spin rotation symmetry in magnets. Pions are the Goldstone bosons for chiral symmetry breaking. So all of these (A, C, D) are Goldstone bosons, hence associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. But Skyrmion isn't a Goldstone boson; it's a different kind of object, a topological soliton.

So the correct answer would be B) Skyrmion, because it's not a Goldstone boson; it's a solution due to the topology of the vacuum, not directly from a spontaneously broken symmetry.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

### Option A: Phonon  
Phonons are quasiparticles representing lattice vibrations in a solid. They arise from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry due to the periodic structure of the crystal lattice. Phonons are Goldstone bosons for this broken symmetry. Therefore, phonons are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

### Option B: Skyrmion  
Skyrmions are topological defects that arise in certain field theories, such as the Skyrme model. They are not Goldstone bosons but rather stable solutions due to the topology of the vacuum. While they may be related to symmetry-breaking phenomena, they are not directly tied to the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Thus, Skyrmions are not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

### Option C: Magnon  
Magnons describe quantized spin waves in magnetically ordered systems. They arise from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry during magnetic ordering, such as in ferromagnets. Magnons are Goldstone bosons for this broken symmetry. Therefore, magnons are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

### Option D: Pion  
Pions are the Goldstone bosons that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This symmetry-breaking mechanism is fundamental in particle physics, and pions are directly tied to this process. Thus, pions are associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Phonons, magnons, and pions are all Goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneously broken symmetries. Skyrmions, on the other hand, are topological solitons and not directly tied to the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
