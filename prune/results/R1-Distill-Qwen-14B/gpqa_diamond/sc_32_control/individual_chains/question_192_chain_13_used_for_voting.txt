Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take a deep breath and think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity inside it has radius r. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and s must be less than R because the cavity is entirely inside. So, the conductor is neutral to begin with, and then we add a positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, but then we put a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor?

Wait, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's interior (the cavity) is a special case. The conductor's material would redistribute charges. Since the conductor was neutral, but we add +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor must develop an induced charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. Let me think: the conductor was uncharged, so any induced charges on the inner surface must be balanced by charges on the outer surface.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because that's how induced charges work. The +q charge attracts electrons from the cavity wall (the inner surface), which leaves the outer surface with a charge of +q to balance. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q (due to electrostatic induction), and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. Because conductor's inner surface has -q, so the outer surface has +q to balance.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so if the cavity has +q, the conductor must have a net charge of -q? No, wait. Because the conductor is a conductor, charges redistribute. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Then the total charge on the conductor is whatever its net charge is. But the conductor was initially neutral, so to have a net charge of zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q, so net charge is zero.

Yes, that's right. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the conductor. But wait, the conductor's charges are outside, so the field inside the conductor is zero. But how about the field outside?

The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside the conductor (points like P) would be as if the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface can be considered as a point charge at the center when outside the sphere.

Wait, but in this case, the charge is on the outer surface. So the electric field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because P is at a distance L from the center.

Wait, but the charge is on the outer surface, so the field outside is same as if the charge were at the center. So option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, let's look at the options. Option B says that. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, but the point P's distance from the cavity center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So how does that factor in?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the point P is at a certain position relative to the cavity. But wait, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So the field outside is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q. So regardless of where P is located, as long as it's outside the conductor, the field is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, unless the conductor's shape affects the field, but in this case, the conductor is spherical, so the field outside is radial and symmetric. Hence, the field at P would be only dependent on the distance from the center of the conductor, not the position relative to the cavity.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the position of the charge inside the cavity is at a different point. So does the position of the cavity's center or the point P's position relative to the cavity's center matter?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so any point outside would see the charge as being at the center, regardless of where the actual cavity is placed. So the field is only due to the +q at the center, so the magnitude is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Alternatively, could the presence of the cavity's position affect the field outside? I don't think so. Because the conductor's charges are on the outer surface, and for a spherical conductor, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

Wait, but in this case, the cavity is off-center. The center of the cavity is s distance away from the center of the conductor. So the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is at position s away from the conductor's center. Then, the induced charges on the conductor's inner surface would be -q. But the conductor's outer surface would have +q, as per the earlier reasoning.

Hmm, but wait, how does the position of the charge inside the cavity (i.e., the location of +q) affect the induced charges on the conductor? I think it would cause the induced charges on the inner surface to be distributed in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, so the inner surface has induced -q, and the outer surface has +q. The arrangement of the inner surface's charge would be such that the field within the conductor is zero. So if the charge +q is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, but the outer surface would still be a uniform sphere because the conductor's outer surface must be a equipotential, and for a spherical conductor, charges distribute uniformly.

Wait, but if the charge inside the cavity is off-center, does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? I think no. Because the outer surface's charge distribution depends only on the presence of external fields. Since there are no external fields in this case, the outer surface remains uniformly charged. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly +q.

So, regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity (even if it's off-center), the outer surface's charge is uniform, and the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

So, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center, which is L. So the magnitude is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, where $s < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$. Both $L$ and $l$ are greater than $R$, ensuring that $P$ is outside the conductor.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) develops an induced charge of $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$. The outer surface of a spherical conductor is an equipotential, and the charges on it distribute uniformly. This means that the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the distance from the center of the conductor.

For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The magnitude of the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The position of the cavity relative to the conductor's center or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field is determined by the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface. Thus, the correct answer is:

**B) $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$**

Answer: B
