Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (d) at position 2. So the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent, making it 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's commonly used for elimination or substitution reactions, maybe even for forming rings through elimination. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: I've heard of the benzidine rearrangement, but that's for different structures. Or maybe this is a case of elimination, forming a ring. Oh, wait! The benzene ring with a substituent might undergo some kind of elimination if there's a leaving group and a possibility for a double bond. But wait, benzene is already aromatic. Unless it's forming a meta-directing group.

Wait, another angle. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the bromine is at position 1 (para position relative to position 2?), no, wait, positions are numbered such that the substituents are as low as possible. So, in benzene, 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para. So 1-bromo and 2-deutero would be adjacent substituents on the ring.

When NaNH2 is used, especially in ammonia, it's often used for dehydrohalogenation. So, perhaps an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. How can we eliminate to form another double bond? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe we're looking at a substitution reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, but it's also a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution reactions, directing groups are important. But bromine is a meta director. So, in a substitution, the new substituent would come in at the meta position. But wait, we're using a strong baseâ€”maybe elimination is more likely than substitution.

Wait, another possibility: The deuterium is at position 2. So, perhaps the deuterium is next to the bromine. With strong base, maybe the base abstracts a proton, but wait, the position has a deuterium, not a proton. Oh, wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good source of NH2- and NH3. So perhaps the base is able to deprotonate somewhere else.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, maybe the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to the Br, but considering that the Br is in position 1, adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, so the H is replaced by D. So the adjacent positions are 2 (D) and 6 (H). So the base could abstract a proton from position 6.

If the base abstracts the proton at position 6, that's adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2 (but wait, position 1 is Br, so perhaps between C1 and C6? Or maybe between C6 and C7? No, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.)

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton beta to the Br. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, position 2 is already substituted with D. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. The adjacent positions to Br are 2 (D) and 6. So the base could abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1.

Then, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, that would make a double bond between C1 and C6, which is between the Br and the position where the proton was abstracted. So that would form a benzene ring with a double bond from C1 to C6, but wait, benzene already has conjugated double bonds. So perhaps the ring would become a di-substituted benzene with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, no. Wait, benzene doesn't have single bonds. So elimination in that scenario would form a new double bond, possibly leading to the formation of a benzannulene or something else? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a ring expansion or a formation of a new ring.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the Br is eliminated as Br- and the ring forms a new structure. So, if we have Br at position 1 and a hydrogen at position 6, abstracting the H from position 6 would lead to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, but since benzene already has conjugated double bonds, this might just form a new substituent.

Wait, maybe the result is benzene with a double bond in a different position. For example, if the Br is lost and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, but position 2 has D, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. The NaNH2 might deprotonate the ring, but since position 2 is D, maybe the base abstracts a proton from a position that's more acidic. Wait, what positions are available? Positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are available (since 1 is Br, 2 is D).

Which of these positions is more acidic? The acidity of protons on benzene is influenced by the substituents. Bromine is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which makes the protons in the ortho and para positions more acidic. So, the positions adjacent to Br (ortho) and across (para) are more acidic.

In this case, the Br is at position 1. The ortho positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so the available ortho position is 6. The para position would be position 4. So, the more acidic protons are at positions 6 and 4.

So, NaNH2 would abstract a proton from either position 4 or 6. Once abstracted, perhaps the ring undergoes a substitution.

Wait, but substitution would require a leaving group. The Br is a leaving group, but in this case, perhaps the abstracted proton leads to a carbanion? Or maybe elimination.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, and the base abstracted H from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, and the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but benzene already has double bonds. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Wait, another possibility: the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, like forming a cycloheptatriene or something else. That might not be right, though.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the reaction: NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aliphatic compounds, leading to the formation of alkenes via E2 mechanisms. But in aromatic compounds, the mechanism might be different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzidine-type elimination. Benzidine is a diamine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another possibility: the base induces elimination, removing H and Br, forming a double bond and releasing HBr.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br), then elimination of Br- would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, that's already part of the conjugated system. Hmm, perhaps that would result in a new structure where the double bond is formed, but I'm not sure how that would look.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a cyclohexadienyl anion, which could then close to form a new ring, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: when benzene rings undergo elimination, sometimes they form annulenes. For example, the benzidine rearrangement forms a naphthalene derivative. But in this case, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a cycloheptatriene or similar.

Wait, maybe it's a simple elimination where Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a new ring structure. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile in this context. Wait, in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 could act as a base, but for dehydrohalogenation, elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond at the position where the Br was, but that doesn't make sense because benzene is fully conjugated.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the possibility of the ring becoming a diene. Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated diene in a six-membered ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible products. The question is how many products are formed. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction forms one product, the answer is B. If two, it's C, etc.

Another approach: What's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? It's bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So, when treated with a strong base, the base could abstract a proton from either position 4 (para to Br) or position 6 (ortho to Br, but position 2 is D, so position 6 is available).

So, if the base abstracts from position 6, adjacent to Br, then elimination of H and Br would form a double bond between C6 and C1. But wait, the ring is six-membered, so maybe that's not possible, leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to Br, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C4. But wait, that's across the ring, which might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a cycloheptatriene. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 and Br is at 1, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6, but in a six-membered ring, that's already a part of the ring. Maybe the ring expands by losing H and Br, forming a seven-membered ring with three double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the result is benzoquinone, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and the base abstracts a proton from either position 4 or 6, leading to two different elimination products. Each of these could form a different structure. So maybe two possible products.

Wait, but wait: the base could abstract a proton from position 4 or 6, leading to two distinct products. So when the base abstracts from position 4, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C4, but that's across the ring. Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring rearranges.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, that's already a single bond, so perhaps the ring would become a cycloheptatriene with a double bond between C1 and C6, which would be a seven-membered ring with conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but the question is about how many products form. So if the base can abstract protons from two different positions, leading to two different products, then the number of products would be two. Hence, the answer would be option C (2).

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the base may abstract protons from both para and ortho positions, but given that position 2 is deuterated, the only ortho position available is position 6. So, the base could abstract from position 6 (ortho) and position 4 (para).

But when the base abstracts from position 6, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, creating a new structure. Similarly, abstracting from position 4 would form a double bond between C1 and C4. But wait, in benzene, C1 is next to C2 and C6. So, if elimination occurs between C1 and C6, that would form a double bond between two adjacent carbons, which is possible but may lead to a different structure.

Wait, but another thought: when the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to Br), which is a meta position relative to the deutero group at position 2. Then, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C4. But benzene has six carbons; can a double bond form across three carbons apart? Not sure. Maybe in this case, the ring would rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, like a cycloheptatriene or something else.

If each abstraction leads to a different product, then there would be two products. So the options are either one, two, three, or four.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br), elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, perhaps leading to a cycloheptatriene. Similarly, abstracting from position 4 (para to Br) would form a double bond between C1 and C4, which is across the ring, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination only occurs in one way. Maybe the base prefers to abstract a proton from the ortho position relative to Br, leading to one product. Or maybe it can abstract from either ortho or para, leading to two products.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the D is at 2. So the available positions for abstraction are 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait no, positions 3 and 5 are meta to Br, and positions 4 is para, and 6 is ortho. But position 2 is D, so position 6 is the other ortho position.

So the base can abstract a proton from position 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Each of these would lead to different elimination products.

So that's two possible products. So the number of products would be two. Hence, the answer is option C, which is 2.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions. The key is to determine how many distinct organic products can form.

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, where bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. The adjacent positions to bromine (ortho) are positions 2 and 6. Since position 2 is occupied by deuterium, the available ortho position for deprotonation is position 6. The para position to bromine is position 4, and the meta positions are 3 and 5.

2. **Reactivity of the Substituents**:  
   Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which increases the acidity of protons in the ortho and para positions. The most acidic protons are at positions 6 (ortho to Br) and 4 (para to Br). The base (NaNHâ‚‚) can abstract a proton from either of these positions.

3. **Elimination Pathways**:  
   - **Deprotonation at Position 6 (Ortho to Br)**:  
     If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, elimination of the bromine atom occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a new aromatic product with a double bond in the ortho position relative to the original bromine.
   - **Deprotonation at Position 4 (Para to Br)**:  
     If the base abstracts a proton from position 4, elimination of the bromine atom occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 4. This results in a new aromatic product with a double bond in the para position relative to the original bromine.

4. **Number of Products**:  
   The two distinct elimination pathways lead to two different products: one with a double bond in the ortho position (positions 1 and 6) and one with a double bond in the para position (positions 1 and 4). These products are structurally distinct and cannot interconvert under the given reaction conditions.

Thus, the reaction produces two possible organic products.
