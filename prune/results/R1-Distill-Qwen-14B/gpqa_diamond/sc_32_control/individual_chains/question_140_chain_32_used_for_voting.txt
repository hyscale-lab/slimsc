Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y to release gas W, and a precipitate G forms. Heating G gives product B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Alright, let's break this down piece by piece.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y. The products are gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it gives B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Hmm, what's 277 K in Celsius? Oh right, 277 K is about 4°C because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C. Wait, but melting points can vary. Let me think: ice melts at 0°C. But maybe B is something that's solid near that temperature. Or perhaps it's a solid that's just starting to melt around there.

Then, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. The simplest case would be a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. Or maybe the molecule itself is a single atom with equal n and p. Wait, for a molecule, the total protons and neutrons should be equal. Let me think. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons and about 8 neutrons (since O has isotopes up to 18O). So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n, so 16 each. That fits. But maybe other possibilities.

But wait, another possibility is CO2. Let's see, CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 p, 6 n (if it's 12C). Each O has 8 p and 8 n. So CO2 would have 6 + 16 = 22 p and 6 + 16 =22 n. That also fits. Hmm, but which one is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe W is water (H2O), but H2O has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and one O (8 p, 8 n). So total p: 2 +8=10, n: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So no.

Another thought: if W is CH4, then C has 6 p, 6n; each H has 1 p, 0 n. So total p=6+4=10, n=6+0=6. Not equal. So no.

Wait, maybe W is an element where each molecule is a diatomic. Let's think about O2 again: each O is 8p, 8n. So O2: 16p and 16n. That would be same number, so W could be O2. Another thought: H2O doesn't fit, as I saw. What about N2? Each N has 7 p and 7 n. So N2 would have 14 p and 14n. That also fits. So W could be either O2 or N2 or perhaps another diatomic like Cl2? Cl has 17 p and 18 n (for Cl-35, which is common). So Cl2 would have 34 p and 36 n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for O2, each O has 8 p and 8 n (assuming it's 16O). So total p = 16, n=16. Yes. Same for N2: 14 p and 14 n. So W could either be O2 or N2 gas.

So what's the reaction between X and Y that produces either O2 or N2 as a gas? Let me think about possible reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2? Wait, no, because CO2 would be a molecule, but, wait, the molecule's total p and n should be same. Let's see: each C is 6 p and 6 n (if 12C), each O is 8 p and 8 n. So CO2: 6 + 2×8 =22 p; 6 + 2×8=22 n. So same number. So CO2 is also a possibility.

Wait, but the problem says that W is a gas released. CO2 is a gas, but so is O2, N2. So which is more likely?

Let me think about the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. So perhaps it's a reaction involving metals and acid. For example, metals reacting with acids to release gas.

Wait, if Y is a liquid, maybe it's an acid. Suppose Y is HCl (liquid conc?), but that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe Y is water, but if Y is water, it's a liquid, but H2O is not a product as a gas unless it's steam, but the problem says W is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, but the precipitate G when heated gives B. So G is perhaps a carbonate or something that decomposes on heating.

Let me think about some known reactions. If X is a metal and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces H2 gas. But earlier, I thought W could be H2, but H2 has 2p and 0n (since H is 1p, 0n for protium). So p would be 2, n 0. Not equal. So W isn't H2.

Wait, another possible reaction: perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, if X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) reacting with HCl (Y). The reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and a salt. But then in that case, the precipitate G would be the salt, which is soluble. Wait, but perhaps Y is not an acid but another liquid. Alternatively, if X is a sulfite or something else.

Alternatively, if X is a metal nitride, reacting with water to produce NH3 gas. But NH3 has 14p and 10n (N:7p,1n; H:1p each. So 7+3=10 p, 1+3=4 n. Not equal. So W isn't NH3.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decomposition reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water (0°C), but 4°C is just above. Or perhaps a solid like ammonium chloride or something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O, which has a certain melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is calcium carbonate, which decomposes upon heating. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide. For example, if G is a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes into oxide and CO2. But then, what's the melting point of oxide? For example, sodium oxide has a high melting point, so that's not around 4°C.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think about the precipitate G. If X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, Y, then G would be the metal salt. But if Y is an acid, then gas W would be CO2. But earlier we thought CO2 is a possibility for W.

So, let's think: X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid. Reaction produces CO2, water, and a salt. The salt may precipitate if it's insoluble. Then, when heated, the salt is perhaps decomposed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product after heating G is B. So if G is a carbonate, but that's already reacted. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a metal oxide, and Y is water. Then, maybe the reaction produces a base and releases O2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the melting point again. B's melting point is near 277 K. That's about 4°C. So maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not sure, but I think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that crystallizes with water. For example, sodium sulfate decahydrate has a melting point around 24°C, but that's higher than 4°C.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid that is just starting to melt at 4°C. So, perhaps it's a solid that's just beginning to melt, like ice. But ice's melting point is 0°C, so 277 K is 4°C. If B is a solid that begins to melt just above 0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is a metal hydroxide, and upon heating, it dehydrates to form a metal oxide (B). But then the melting point of the oxide would be high, not near 4°C. So that's not likely.

Wait, maybe B is something like ammonium chloride. Wait, no, ammonium chloride decomposes around 337 K (64°C). Hmm, not matching.

Let me try another angle. The part about the product of a keto acid with X having two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that reacts with the keto acid in a neutralization reaction. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would produce a sodium salt, water, and release CO2 maybe? Wait, but the product would have more oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, X might be something else. Wait, the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a simple neutralization, where the acid (RCOOH) reacts with a base (like NaOH) to form a salt (RCOONa) and water. The product (the salt) would have the structure RCOO^- Na^+. The acid had two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group (RCOOH), so the salt would also have those. But wait, the product has two oxygen atoms, so maybe the product is a diatomic molecule, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO2. Wait, that might release CO2, but I'm not sure how that ties into the product having two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is PCl5, which can dehydrate carboxylic acids to form anhydrides. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the main point is that when X reacts with a keto acid, the product contains two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a carbonyl compound, like an aldehyde or ketone. But I'm not sure.

Let me circle back. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Common reagents in organic chemistry could be things like NaOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, NaNO2, or perhaps something like sulfuric acid, but it's not an element. Wait, but the question says 'element', so X is a compound made up of elements, one of which has a heavier isotope.

Wait, but wait, the question says "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So X is a compound, but it's made up of elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Wait, but if X contains heavier isotopes, perhaps it's a naturally occurring compound with isotopes. For example, sodium has isotopes like 23Na and 25Na? Wait, no, sodium is Na with atomic number 11. Common isotopes are 23Na (100% abundance), and a trace of 24Na and 25Na. Wait, but 25Na would have a mass of about 25, but the natural abundance is so low that maybe the question is referring to a substituted isotope.

Alternatively, another element. Let's think about perhaps X being NH3, which is used in organic reactions. But NH3 doesn't have a heavier isotope in its elements (N and H). Wait, but H has deuterium as a heavier isotope. So if X is NH3, and one of the H's is replaced by D, then the compound would have a heavier isotope. But would that affect the cumulative atomic masses?

Wait, but the question says that the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a base that neutralizes the acid, releasing CO2 or something else.

Wait, another thought: X could be sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Let's think about this. NaHCO3 reacts with an acid (like HCl) to produce CO2, water, and NaCl. So in that case, W would be CO2. Let's see if that fits.

So, the reaction would be:

NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + CO2 + H2O.

In this case, if Y is HCl (liquid), then gas W is CO2. CO2 has 12 p and 16 n (if carbon is 12C, oxygen is 16O). So 12 p and 16 n. Wait, but the problem says W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So that would mean 12 p and 12 n, which doesn't fit because O would have 8 p and 8 n, so CO2's total is 12 p and 16 n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if it's O2, then as I thought earlier, O has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n. That would fit. So W is O2.

So what reaction would produce O2 gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction, like the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, if X is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which upon decomposition produces O2. But wait, if X is H2O2, what would be the reaction with Y?

Alternatively, another reaction: if X is a metal peroxide, and Y is an acid. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with an acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, leading to CO2. But earlier I thought that doesn't fit the W molecule's n and p being equal.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Let me think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid to have a product with two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. Then, the reaction would be:

RCOOH + NaOH → RCOO^- Na^+ + H2O.

The product (sodium carboxylate) has the RCOO^- group. That group has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate (O and O). So the product would have two O's, perhaps. So that fits the condition.

So if X is NaOH, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Also, NaOH incorporates Na and O and H. Now, Na has isotopes, but the common isotope is 23Na. But the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide) where H is replaced by D. But D is a heavier isotope of H. So if X is NaOD, that's a heavier form of NaOH, but perhaps it's not commonly used as a reagent. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH, which has H, but if one H is replaced by D, making it a heavier isotope.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3, which has C, Na, and O. Carbon has isotopes like 12C and 13C and 14C. So maybe X contains a heavier isotope of C, like 13C.

Now, the problem says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X must be calculated. So in X, the elements present are, for example, Na, O, and H (if X is NaOH). The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is O (if X is NaOH), but wait, O has an atomic number higher than Na? No: Na is 11, O is 8. So the heaviest element in X would be Na, since Na has a higher atomic number than O and H.

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of atomic number, O is 8, Na is 11, so Na is heavier. So for X as NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. So the lightest element is H (atomic number 1), the heaviest is Na (11). So their atomic masses would be H is 1, Na is around 23. So cumulative would be 24. But the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm, 24 isn't an option. So perhaps this is not the right track.

Wait, another thought: if X is NH3. Then the elements are N and H. The lightest is H, heaviest is N. Atomic masses: H is 1, N is 14. Sum is 15. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is CH3OH (methanol), but that's not typically used as a reagent. Wait, but the problem says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, so maybe it's something like H2SO4, but that's not an element. Wait, but the question says it's a substance composed of elements, so it's a compound.

Wait, another angle: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like H2O (but that's three atoms), or maybe something like CO2 (two O). But wait, in that case, the product would have two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is something that when it reacts with the keto acid, it adds O's. For example, if X is a base that deprotonates the acid, forming a salt. The salt would have the same number of O as the acid. But the product has two O atoms, so perhaps the acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), which has two O's in the carboxylic group. Then the product (the salt) would have two O's as well. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, let's think about the isotopes again. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So in X, one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X contains Cl, it's possible that it's using a heavier isotope like 37Cl.

But then, what is X? Perhaps X is HCl, which is a reagent in organic chemistry. But when HCl reacts with a base, like NaOH, it forms NaCl and water. But I'm not sure how that ties into the rest.

Alternatively, think about X being a halogen, but as a compound. Wait, maybe X is NaCl. But NaCl is a salt, and when it reacts with something else...?

Wait, perhaps the reaction of X with Y is a metathesis reaction. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is HCl, the reaction produces NaCl, CO2, and H2O. So in that case, the precipitate might not form because NaCl is soluble. Hmm, but the reaction produces a precipitate G, so perhaps Y is an insoluble salt.

Wait, another angle: if X is a metal, and Y is water. For example, sodium metal reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. So in that case, W would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition of equal p and n. Because H2 has 2p and 0n.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal carbonate and an acid. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. Then, the precipitate G could be CaCl2, but it's soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid that when reacts with X, produces a precipitate. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt, and X is a metal that displaces it. For example, if Y is copper sulfate solution (CuSO4), and X is zinc metal. The reaction would produce ZnSO4, Cu metal precipitate, and SO2 or H2 gas? Wait, no, the reaction would produce H2 if it's an acid, but if it's a sulfate solution, the reaction would produce H2SO4?

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium metal, which reacts with water (Y) to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to list possible substances X that fit the given conditions.

Possible X candidates:

1. NaOH – a common reagent. But does it have a heavier isotope? Yes, if one of the H's is deuterium (D). So X could be NaOD, but I'm not sure if that's a common reagent.

2. NH3 – doesn't have heavier isotopes beyond D, which would make it NH2D, but not sure.

3. H2O – if it's heavy water, D2O, but again, not sure.

4. Na2CO3 – perhaps with a heavier isotope of C.

Wait, but the problem says X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope, so it's possible that X is a naturally occurring compound with isotopes, like NaCl (with 37Cl), but we're looking for the elements present.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, if X contains elements A and B, with A being the lightest and B the heaviest, their atomic masses are added. So, for example, if X is NaOH, then elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But the options don't include 24. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Another possibility: X is NH4Cl. Then elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 1 + 35.5 =36.5. Closest option is 35 (option A). Hmm, but the sum is 36.5, which is not exactly 35, but maybe the question uses approximate atomic masses.

Wait, but if X is NH4Cl, when it reacts with a keto acid, like acetic acid, the product would be NH4 acetate, which has more oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product is supposed to have two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl. But NaCl doesn't react with keto acids in a way that the product has two O's. Alternatively, maybe X is NaNO2, which is a reagent in organic chemistry (used in diazotization). Then, the elements are Na, N, O. Lightest is Na (11) or O (8)? Wait, no: Na is 11, O is 8. So the lightest is O, heaviest is N (14). Wait, no: N is 7, O is 8. So O is heavier than N. So in NaNO2, the elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16). So lightest is N (14?), wait no: elements are compared by their atomic numbers. Wait, no, the lightest element is the one with the smallest atomic mass. Wait, no: the question says "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", I think it refers to the elements with the smallest and largest atomic numbers. So for X as NaNO2, the elements are Na (11), N (7), O (8). So the lightest element is N (atomic number 7), heaviest is Na (11). So their atomic masses are N (14) and Na (23). Sum is 37. The options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X could be KMnO4. It's used as a reagent. The elements are K, Mn, O. Lightest is K (19), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 74, which is not an option.

Alternatively, X could be H2O2. Elements are H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Hmm. Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is near 277 K. So what solid is known to have a melting point around 277 K? Let me think: 277 K is 4°C. So perhaps B is ammonium chloride. Wait, I think ammonium chloride has a melting point around 373 K (100°C), so that's not it. What about sodium carbonate decahydrate? Its melting point is around 277 K. Let me check: I think sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K (4°C). That fits.

So if B is Na2CO3·10H2O, then G is the anhydrous Na2CO3, perhaps. But how does that form from X and Y?

Wait, if X is Na2CO3·10H2O (the decahydrate), and Y is something that causes dehydration. For example, heating with a liquid like concentrated HCl might remove water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a liquid that reacts to form a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3, and Y is water. Then, X (Na2CO3) reacts with Y (H2O) to form Na2CO3·10H2O. But that's hydration, not a reaction that produces a gas.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the reaction again.

X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate). When G is heated, it gives B.

If B is Na2CO3·10H2O, then heating G would produce B. So G is Na2CO3, which upon heating with water would form the decahydrate. But that's not a typical reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps G is Na2CO3·nH2O, and upon heating, it loses water to form an anhydrous form. Wait, but that would lower the melting point.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something else. Let's think about a reaction that produces a carbonate as a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and X is a metal that displaces it. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and the corresponding salt. But if the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl. Then, the reaction would produce CaCl2 (soluble), CO2 gas, and H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is between X (a metal) and Y (a solution of a carbonate). For example, if X is Mg metal and Y is Na2CO3 solution. The reaction would produce MgCO3, which is a precipitate, Na metal, and perhaps some other products. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) reacts with an acid to produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. If Y is an acid like H2SO4, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is not an acid but a liquid like water. If X is a metal carbonate, and Y is water, the reaction might not proceed unless it's heated, but that's a hydration reaction, not a violent reaction.

This is getting quite complicated. Let me try to think about the possible elements in X again. The problem states that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X should be calculated. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Looking for a sum that matches one of these options. For example, 25 could be H (1) + S (32), but 1+32=33, which is not 25. Alternatively, C (12) + O (16) =28, which is close to option C (31). Hmm. Or maybe N (14) + O (16) =30, which is close to D (29). Or perhaps if it's C (12) and Cl (35.5), sum is 47.5, which is not an option.

Wait, another approach: what if X contains only two elements, one light and one heavy. For example, H and Cl. So H is 1, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 36.5, which is near option A (35). So perhaps X is HCl, which is a reagent in organic chemistry. Now, when HCl reacts with a keto acid, like acetic acid, it would produce Cl- and acetate ions, but I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe X is HCl, which when reacts with a base, like NaOH, produces NaCl and water. But how does that tie into the two O atoms?

Wait, but the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two O atoms. If X is HCl, the reaction would be acid-base neutralization: RCOOH + HCl → RCOCl + H2O. Wait, but RCOCl is an acid chloride, which has two O atoms (O from COCl). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is esterification, but that would require an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like PCl5, which reacts with a keto acid to form an acid chloride. For example, RCOOH + PCl5 → RCOCl + POCl3 + HCl. The product RCOCl has two O atoms (in COCl). So that fits the condition. So if X is PCl5, then the elements are P and Cl.

Now, the elements in X are P and Cl. The lightest element is P (atomic number 15) and Cl (17). Wait, no: P has a higher atomic number than Cl? No, Cl is 17, P is 15. So the lightest element is P (15), heaviest is Cl (17). Wait, but in terms of atomic mass, P is about 31, Cl is about 35. So their sum is 31 +35=66. Not an option. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Wait, another thought: X could be NH4Cl, which is used in organic reactions. The elements are N, H, Cl. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is near option A (35). So if the question uses approximate atomic masses, 35.5 is taken as 36, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the question uses exact masses, but 35 is an option.

Another possibility: X is NaCl. The elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 58.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, another angle: the problem mentions that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be summed, considering all isotopes. So if X contains, say, chlorine which has isotopes up to 37Cl, but the question says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes present. Hmm, but wait, the problem says: "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." Wait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read again.

It says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps it's referring to the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements (by atomic number) in X, but for each element, sum all isotopes' masses present. Or perhaps for each element, only the lightest and heaviest isotopes are considered and summed.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps it's that for each element in X, if there are multiple isotopes present, their masses are summed. Then, the lightest and heaviest elements (by atomic number) in X are considered, and their cumulative atomic masses (sum of all their isotopes) are added.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and the heaviest elements' atomic masses, regardless of isotopes. Because isotopes don't change the atomic number or the element.

Wait, but the problem says "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Ah, perhaps it means that for each element in X, if there are multiple isotopes present, we have to sum their masses. Then, from all the elements in X, find the lightest (smallest atomic number) and the heaviest (largest atomic number), and sum their individual masses (each being the sum of all isotopes for that element present).

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Let me think of an example. Suppose X is H2O (light isotope and heavy isotopes like D2O). Then, elements are H and O. For H in X, if there are multiple isotopes (H and D), their masses are summed. So for H, sum is 1 (H) + 2 (D) =3. O has a single isotope (16O), mass 16. So the lightest element is H (sum 3), heaviest is O (sum 16). Then, the cumulative is 3+16=19. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, regardless of isotopes. For example, for X as H2O, the elements are H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3OH, which has C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is NH3, elements are N (14) and H (1). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a diatomic molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the product is a compound with two O atoms, like CO2.

Wait, but the product is a result of X and a keto acid reacting. So perhaps X is a base, like KOH, and the reaction produces a salt and water. The product would have the same number of O atoms as the acid. For example, if the acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid), then the product would be K2CO3, which has three O's. Hmm, not two.

Alternatively, if the acid is H2SO4, then the product would be K2SO4, which has four O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), which has two O's. So when it reacts with X (a base), the product would be the corresponding formate salt, which also has two O's. So that fits. So X would be a base, like NaOH. Then, the product is NaHCOO (sodium formate), which has two O's.

So, if X is NaOH, which is a reagent in organic chemistry, and when it reacts with formic acid, it produces sodium formate, which has two O's. That fits the condition.

Now, the elements in X (NaOH) are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But the options don't have 24.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). The elements are Na, H, C, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24 again.

Wait, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for X as NaHCO3, perhaps one of the H's is D (deuterium). So the H's mass would be 2 instead of 1. But how does that affect the sum?

Wait, the question says to sum the "cumulative atomic masses" of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all isotopes. So for the element H in X, if it has both H and D isotopes, each contributes their mass. Let's say X has n H atoms and m D atoms. Then, the total mass for H in X would be n*(1) + m*(2).

Wait, but the question says to sum the "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So for NaHCO3, the lightest element is H, heaviest is Na. So their atomic masses, considering all isotopes, need to be summed.

But how? For H, if some are H and some are D, the total mass for H in X would be (number of H)*1 + (number of D)*2. But the question isn't clear on whether it's considering the masses of each isotope present in the molecule or just the element's atomic mass. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is just the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, without considering isotopes. So for NaOH, H is 1, Na is 23. Sum 24. Not an option.

Hmm. Let's think about other possible X compounds. Maybe X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's an acid, not a base. But when it reacts with a base, it would produce a salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the options given. The options are 25,29,31,35. Let's see what pairs of elements could sum to these.

Option A: 35. Possible pairs: 1 (H) + 34 (Se). But 34 is not a common element. Or 16 (O) +19 (K) =35. K is 19, O is 16. Sum 35.

Option B:25. 1 (H) +24 (Cr). No. Or 12 (C) +13 (Al). No. Or 16 (O) +9 (F) =25. Hmm, O (16) and F (9). Sum 25. That's option B.

Option C:31. 12 (C) +19 (K)=31. Or 15 (P) +16 (O)=31.

Option D:29. 14 (N) +15 (O)=29? No, O is 16. 17 (Cl) + 12 (C)=29. No. Or 14 (N) +15 (P)=29. Or 16 (O) +13 (Al)=29. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about which element pairs are more likely in a compound used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Option C: 31 could be C (12) + K (19). If X contains both C and K, perhaps as in K2CO3. Then, the lightest element is C (6), but wait, K is 19, C is 6. So the lightest is C, heaviest is K. Wait, no. Wait, K has a higher atomic number than C. So in K2CO3, the elements are K (19), C (6), O (8). So lightest is O (8), heaviest is K (19). Sum is 19 + 16 (O) =35. That's option A.

Wait, but O has an atomic mass of 16. So sum would be 19 (K) +16 (O) =35, which is option A.

So if X is K2CO3, which is used as a reagent in some organic reactions, then the elements are K, C, O. The lightest element is O (atomic number 8), heaviest is K (19). Their atomic masses are 39 (K) and 16 (O). Sum is 55, which isn't an option. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check:

K has an atomic mass of approximately 39, O is 16. Sum is 55, not an option.

Wait, then perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the sum is the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, each considering their isotopes. For example, if X contains H (with isotopes H and D), and Cl (with 35Cl and 37Cl), then the sum would be the sum of all H isotopes and all Cl isotopes.

Wait, but that's not what the question says. The question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Hmm. Maybe it's that for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present, then the lightest and heaviest elements' summed isotopes are added together.

For example, if X is HCl, which has H (1H and 2H) and Cl (35Cl and 37Cl), then:

For H: 1 + 2 =3.

For Cl: 35 +37=72.

Then, the lightest element is H (sum 3), heaviest is Cl (sum 72). Their sum is 3+72=75. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if X is NH3, which has N and H. If H has isotopes, sum for H is 1 +2 (if any D present) =3. N has isotopes like 14N, 15N. Sum 14 +15=29.

So the lightest element is H (sum 3), heaviest N (sum 29). Their sum is 3+29=32, which is close to option C (31). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is done per element, not per isotope. Wait, but the question says to sum all isotopes present.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of another angle. The question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I can deduce the correct answer based on the options and the clues.

The melting point of B is close to 277 K. As I thought earlier, perhaps B is sodium carbonate decahydrate. So G, the precipitate, is the anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na2CO3. When heated, Na2CO3·10H2O loses water and becomes anhydrous.

So the reaction would be:

X + Y → Na2CO3 (G) + CO2 (W) + H2O.

So X is perhaps Na2CO3·10H2O? That doesn't make sense because then Y would be something that removes water.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium carbonate decahydrate, and Y is a liquid like ethanol. But that's not a violent reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. For example, if X is Na2CO3·10H2O and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce NaCl, CO2, and water. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid, leading to the production of CO2 gas, and the precipitate is the corresponding salt.

Wait, but the product after heating G is B, which is Na2CO3·10H2O.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is between X and Y to form G, which upon heating gives B (the decahydrate). So maybe G is the anhydrous form, and upon heating in the presence of water, it forms the hydrate.

But I'm not making progress on this part. Let me think again about the possible elements.

If the sum is 31 (option C), perhaps the elements are C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum 28. Close but not quite. Or perhaps N and O: N is 14, O is 16. Sum 30. Close to option D (29). Alternatively, if it's O (16) and F (19): sum 35 (option A).

Wait, but O and F are not typically found together in a common reagent like X.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum 51.5, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 25. That would be 1 (H) + 24 (Cr). But I don't think X is chromium-based.

Alternatively, if the sum is 29 (option D), perhaps the elements are N (14) and O (16). 14+16=30, which is close but not 29. Alternatively, perhaps it's F (19) and O (16). 19+16=35 (option A).

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the possible products.

If the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with two O atoms, and X is a base like NaOH, then the product is a sodium salt with two O's. So X is NaOH. Then, the elements in X are Na, O, H.

Now, X incorporates a heavier isotope. For Na, the common isotope is 23Na, but it has a heavier isotope 25Na. So X could be a mixture containing 23Na and 25Na.

So the elements present are Na, O, H.

The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 24. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question considers the sum of all the isotopes of the lightest and heaviest elements. So for H in X, if it has H and D, their masses are 1 and 2. So for each H atom, sum 1, for each D, sum 2.

But I don't know how many H and D atoms are present in X. Without that information, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements, each taken as their most common isotope's mass.

So for X as NaOH, it's H (1) and Na (23). Sum 24, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the initial reaction again. X reacts with Y to produce W (gas with same p and n), precipitate G, which when heated gives B (melting point 277 K).

If W is O2, then the reaction is one that produces O2 gas. One such reaction is the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, if X is H2O2, and Y is a catalyst like MnO2, then H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. But in that case, the precipitate would be the catalyst, which doesn't change. So perhaps Y is a solution and X is the peroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal peroxide, like Na2O2, which reacts with water to produce O2. The reaction would be:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So in this case, W is O2. That fits the condition of same p and n (each O is 8p,8n → O2 has 16p,16n).

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, which is soluble. Hmm, not fitting because the problem states that a precipitate forms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, producing CO2 gas. But earlier that didn't fit.

Wait, but if X is Na2O2, and Y is water, the reaction produces NaOH and O2. NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think about another reaction that produces O2 and a precipitate.

Another possibility: the thermal decomposition of a chlorate, like KClO3. But that's not a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with a solution of CaCl2 to produce NaCl, CaCO3 (precipitate), CO2, and HCl. But I'm not sure about this reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is NaHCO3, Y is CaCl2. Then, the reaction would be:

2 NaHCO3 + CaCl2 → 2 NaCl + CaCO3↓ + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W is CO2 (does it fit the p and n condition? CO2 has 12 p and 16 n → no, 12≠16. So W is CO2, which doesn't fit. So this doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe W is O2. Then, the reaction must produce O2. Let's think of a reaction where a peroxide reacts with an acid to produce O2.

For example: H2O2 + H2SO4 → SO2 (or O2?) Wait, no. H2O2 + H2SO4 (concentrated) → SO2↑ + H2O + O2↑. But this is a decomposition reaction, and the products are gases. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide, but I'm not making progress.

Another thought: If W is O2, perhaps X is a metal oxide that reacts with an acid to produce O2. But I'm not aware of such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid, but that would produce CO2, not O2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2.

Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2↓ + 2 NH3↑.

But NH3 doesn't fit the same p and n condition. NH3 has 7 p and (1*3 +7 )=10 n. So 7 p and 10 n. Not equal.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me try to proceed by considering the options again.

The options are 25,29,31,35.

I think the correct answer is option C (31), but I'm not certain. Let me think why.

If X is NaHCO3, which is a reagent in organic chemistry. The elements are Na, H, C, O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 24. Not 31.

Alternatively, if X is something like KCl, which is used as a reagent. The elements are K (39) and Cl (35.5). Sum 74.5. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH4Cl. Elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5 → approx 35, option A.

But earlier I thought that X as HCl could fit, but the product of reacting with a keto acid would be an acid chloride, which has two O's.

Wait, if X is HCl, and reacts with a keto acid (like acetic acid), the product is acetyl chloride (CH3COCl), which has two O atoms. So that fits the condition.

Now, the elements in X (HCl) are H and Cl.

The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Their sum is 36.5. The options have 35 (A). So perhaps the question rounds it to 35.

So the cumulative atomic masses would be 1 (H) + 35.5 (Cl) =36.5. Rounding to 35 isn't exact, but it's the closest option.

So the answer would be option A (35).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Another possible X is KMnO4. The elements are K, Mn, O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 71. Not an option.

Hmm. I think I'll go with option C (31), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D (29), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is H2O, which has one O, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the product is a ketone, which has one O, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a base like KOH, and reacts with a keto acid to form a salt and water. The product would have the same O's as the acid. For example, if the acid is HCOOH (formic acid), the product is KCOOH (potassium formate), which has two O's in the formate ion (COO^-). So that fits.

So X is KOH. The elements in X are K, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum is 40. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier analysis, the sum for X as HCl would be closest to option A (35). So I'll choose that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a substance X that reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W, a precipitate G, and a final product B upon heating G. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C), and the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include O₂ (16 p, 16 n) or N₂ (14 p, 14 n). The reaction likely involves O₂, as it fits the context of a violent reaction and the subsequent formation of a precipitate.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: The precipitate G, when heated, produces B with a melting point near 277 K. Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O) has a melting point close to this value, suggesting B could be this compound. This implies G is the anhydrous form of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃).

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product contains two oxygen atoms. If X is HCl, reacting with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid) could produce an acid chloride (e.g., CH₃COCl), which has two oxygen atoms. This fits the condition.

4. **Elements in X**: If X is HCl, the elements are H and Cl. The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is Cl (atomic mass ~35.5). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to approximately 36.5. Among the options provided, the closest is **35**.

5. **Isotopes and Cumulative Masses**: The problem specifies that if multiple isotopes are present, their masses must be summed. For HCl, isotopes like ¹H and ²H (deuterium) contribute to the total mass of H, and isotopes like ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl contribute to the total mass of Cl. However, the question likely simplifies the calculation to the most common isotopes, leading to the sum of 35.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Cl) elements in X, considering isotopes, align most closely with **Option A (35)**.

Answer: A
