Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to find the reagents A and B that make these reactions happen, then choose the correct option from the given choices.

First reaction: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the same carbon. Hmm. So, what kind of reaction is this?

I remember that the nucleophilic addition to ketones can happen. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is attacked by the CN-.

Wait, but usually when you add a nucleophile to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. Oh right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with CN-; it's a geminal diol (but in this case, it's a hydroxyl and a nitrile on the same carbon).

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl, so the product should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Let me draw this.

Butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, structure is (CH3)2CO. So when you add CN-, it would add to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, but the name says butanenitrile, which implies four carbons in the chain. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon structure. When we add CN- to the carbonyl, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is different. Wait, no, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the product.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is 3 carbons. After adding CN-, we get (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's four carbons: the two methyl groups, the OH and CN on the same carbon. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is named as butanenitrile. Maybe I'm getting confused with the nomenclature. Maybe the correct IUPAC name is butanenitrile because it's four carbons in total? Let me see. (CH3)2C(OH)CN has four carbons: the central C is attached to two CH3, OH, and CN. So the main chain would be four carbons? Wait, no. The main chain would be three carbons: the central C is the second carbon. So the nitrile is on the second carbon, but that would make it propanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple addition but something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substitution? No, ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has four carbons. So maybe the starting ketone is different. Wait, no, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, three carbons. Hmm, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. Maybe I'm not seeing the structure correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The reaction is between a ketone and CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh right, the addition of hydrogen cyanide (or its salt) to a ketone is done under acidic conditions. So, what's the role of reagent A here? It must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. So A is H3O+ (acid), which is present in option A and B.

So for the first reaction, I think reagent A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction. The product from the first reaction, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the starting material is actually a substituted compound: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is at position 2, and there's a hydroxyl group and a benzyl group attached to that same carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. There are different methods: one is using H2O and acid, another is using H2O and base, and another is using H2O with a catalyst like HgSO4 and H2SO4 (maybe the Stephen reduction? No, that's for ketones to aldehydes).

Wait, the typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions. For example, H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, another way is to use HCl and H2O, perhaps with HgSO4 as a catalyst.

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. But that can't be right on its own. So the reagent B must be something else, but in the question, it's written as B (H2O). So perhaps the reagent is H2O along with an acid or base.

Wait, looking at the options, the options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. So the second reaction uses B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, we're going from nitrile to carboxylic acid. The conditions for this hydrolysis are usually strong acidic or basic conditions. Let's think about the reagents available.

In option A, B is HCl. So in HCl and water, that's acidic conditions. So adding HCl and H2O would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Another option is using HgSO4 in H2SO4, but that's not present in the options. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of HCl, the nitrile hydrolyzes to the acid.

So for the second step, reagent B is HCl, which is option A.

So putting it together, reagent A is H3O+ (as per the first reaction), and reagent B is HCl (option A).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → correct.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, not sure if it's strong enough for hydrolysis. Maybe not.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. Hmm, sodium bisulfate is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, NaHSO3 would give H+ and HSO3^-; but I'm not sure when that's used. Maybe in the first reaction, but I thought it was H3O+.

Wait, let me think again. The first reaction: butanone + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. The catalyst is usually H+ (like H2SO4, H3O+). So if A is NaHSO3, which would provide H+ because it's a strong acid (H2SO3 is weaker, but in solution, NaHSO3 would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating H+). So perhaps in aqueous solution, NaHSO3 could provide the necessary H+.

Wait, but then the product would be the same. So whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3, any acid would work, right? Because the key is to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, either H3O+ or another acid like NaHSO3 might work. But which is more likely?

Wait, the reaction between ketones and CN- (like in the presence of HCN) is typically acid-catalyzed. So the acid could be H3O+ or another strong acid. But NaHSO3 is a weak acid (HSO3^- is a weak acid, pKa around 1.8). So would that be strong enough? I'm not too sure. H3O+ is a strong acid, so it's more likely.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So for option A, reagent A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So that fits.

Looking at the second reaction, B is HCl. So the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions. So the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So the correct option is A.

The question involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
Butan-2-one is a ketone, and the reaction involves the addition of CN⁻ (from NaCN) to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This type of reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step. Sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₃) is less likely because it is a weaker acid and may not provide sufficient protonation.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since H₂O alone is insufficient, the reagent B must provide the necessary acidic environment. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid and is suitable for this reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and may not be strong enough for efficient hydrolysis.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction as an acid catalyst.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction as a strong acid for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is correct.  

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and unlikely to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile in the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the first reaction.  
  - HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the first reaction.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and unlikely to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile in the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
