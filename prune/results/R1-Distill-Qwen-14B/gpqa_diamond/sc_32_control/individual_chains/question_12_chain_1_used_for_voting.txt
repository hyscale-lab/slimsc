Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, the pion is at rest, right? So Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I guess the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others, so maybe we can ignore it for this problem.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but the neutrino has a very small mass, almost zero. So the neutrino's energy would be approximately equal to its momentum (since E = sqrt(p²c² + m²c⁴), and m is near zero, so E ≈ pc). So the muon's momentum and the neutrino's momentum must balance each other out.

Let me think about the energies. The rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. When it decays, this energy is converted into the rest mass energies of the muon and neutrino, plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. So the pion's rest mass is larger than the muon's, so there should be some kinetic energy left over. And the neutrino would carry away some energy as well.

So the total energy available is the rest mass of the pion: 139.6 MeV. This equals the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is their rest mass plus kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy.

Let me write this down:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV

Final energy: E_final = E_mu + E_nu

E_mu = (m_mu c²) + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu ≈ 0)

So, E_initial = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

But I also know that the total momentum must be zero because the pion was at rest. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) and the neutrino (p_nu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, but opposite in direction.

But since E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), for each particle.

So for the muon:
E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² c² + (105.7 MeV)^2 )

For the neutrino:
E_nu = p_nu c (since m_nu ≈ 0, E ≈ pc)

And since p_mu = p_nu = p (magnitude), we can write E_nu = p c.

Now, substituting E_mu and E_nu into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, that's an equation with one variable, p. Let me see if I can solve for p.

Let me denote p c as x for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2
x² + 11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Wait, let's compute 105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 ≈ 11172.49, which is approximately 11173.29 as written.

Similarly, 139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So 19321 + 166.8 +0.36 = 19488.16, which matches.

So, subtract x² from both sides. We get:

11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Wait, wait, the equation is:

x² + 11173.29 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So, subtract x² from both sides:

11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2, right? So, yes.

So, bringing terms to the left:

11173.29 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x

So,

-8314.87 = -279.2 x

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = 8314.87 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute this. 

Hmm, 279.2 is approximately 280.

8314.87 / 279.2 ≈ Let me do it accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (since 280 * 30 is 8400, but 279.2 is 0.8 less than 280.)

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 8314.87 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8.

279.2 * 20 = 5584
279.2 *9=2512.8 → 5584 + 2512.8 =8096.8
279.2 * 0.8= 223.36 → 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.

But our numerator is 8314.87, which is a bit less. So 29.8 is 279.2 *29.8 = 8320.16. Our numerator is 8314.87, which is 5.29 less.

So, 29.8 minus (5.29 / 279.2) → 5.29 / 279.2 ≈0.019.

So approximately 29.8 - 0.019 = 29.781.

So x ≈29.781 MeV/c.

Wait, x is p c, so p = x / c. But perhaps we don't need to worry about units here because we're dealing with the same system.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, let's compute E_nu, which is x =29.78 MeV.

E_mu is sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: about 886.4.

105.7 squared is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.4 + 11172.49 = 12058.89 → sqrt(12058.89) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the pion's rest mass is 139.6, and E_mu is 109.81, and E_nu is 29.78, sum is 139.59, which is about right. So that's correct.

Now, the energies are E_mu = 109.81 MeV, and E_nu =29.78 MeV.

But wait, the muon's energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The rest mass is 105.7, so K_mu is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is all kinetic, so K_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.12 and 29.8. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B)7.2, 32.8

C)3.52, 20.8

D)4.12, 29.8

Hmm, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches our calculation. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV, K_nu is 29.8 MeV.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Energy Conservation:
The total energy of the system before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the energy is the rest energy of the pion:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:

\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu},
\]

where:
- \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}\) (rest energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy),
- \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\) (since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible).

Thus:

\[
139.6 = (105.7 + K_{\mu}) + K_{\nu}.
\]

### Momentum Conservation:
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:

\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \, (\text{magnitude}).
\]

The energy of each particle is related to its momentum by:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2}, \quad E_{\nu} = p c.
\]

Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:

\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c.
\]

Let \(x = p c\). The equation becomes:

\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x.
\]

### Solving for \(x\):
Rearranging:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]

Canceling \(x^2\) and rearranging:

\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]

\[
-8315.67 = -279.2x.
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(p c = x \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino's Energy**: \(E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).
2. **Muon's Energy**: \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}\).

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{886.4 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.89} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Kinetic Energies:
- \(K_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(K_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Matching with Options:
The correct match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
