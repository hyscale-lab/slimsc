Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like when calculations result in infinite values. The idea is to make the theory finite by introducing some form of cutoff, and then take the limit where that cutoff goes away. But wait, not all theories might require this, right?

The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is a quantum theory of gravity, and it's supposed to unify all the fundamental forces. But string theory is a background-dependent theory, right? Wait, no, I think it's background-independent, but maybe that's a different point. Anyway, string theory deals with higher dimensions and is a theory of everything. But how about regularization? I think in string theory, the concept of regularization might not be needed because it's a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, interactions are calculated using perturbative expansions with Feynman diagrams, but perhaps the structure of the theory avoids the same divergences. Or maybe it's because string theory incorporates gravity, which could help in making the theory finite. Or perhaps it's the oppositeâ€”string theory does require regularization, but maybe in different ways. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and I know that in QCD, things like the running of coupling constants are important. Also, I recall that because of asymptotic freedom, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weak. Wait, but does that mean QCD requires regularization? I remember that QCD calculations often involve things like lattice regularization, especially because of issues with renormalization. Or wait, maybe not. Since QCD is a renormalizable theory, you can use standard renormalization techniques. So perhaps regularization is used during calculations but it's not that the theory fundamentally requires it. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether each theory is renormalizable and how regularization factors in.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood, renormalizable theory. I remember that in QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. So you have to regularize these. For example, using methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization techniques because of these divergences. So C is probably not the correct answer because the question is asking which one never requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, classical ED is different because it's a non-quantum theory. In classical electromagnetism, there are no divergences that require regularization because you don't have the same issues with infinities that come up in quantum theories. For example, in classical ED, point charges are handled with their fields, but there's no issue of vacuum polarization or renormalization because those are quantum effects. So in classical ED, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. So D might be the correct answer because it's a classical theory and doesn't require regularization at all.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Does that change anything for D? Because classical ED breaks down at high energies when quantum effects become significant, but the theory itself doesn't require regularization because it's classical. So the theory as it stands doesn't need regularization. So D is a possible correct option.

Now, going back to the other options. So the question is which theory never requires regularization. So the other options (A, B, C) are quantum theories that require regularization. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, string theory (A) is a quantum theory, but perhaps it's formulated in a way that doesn't require the same kind of regularization because the theory is background-independent and incorporates gravity, but I'm not entirely certain if it requires regularization. From what I remember, string theory calculations can still have divergences, especially in certain limits or when considering different perturbative expansions. But I also think that in some approaches, like the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain aspects are regularized, but that's more about the specific techniques used rather than the theory fundamentally needing it.

QCD (B) is a renormalizable theory, so in principle, it can be handled with standard renormalization techniques. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? I think regularization is part of the renormalization process. So even though QCD is renormalizable, you still need to regularize the theory when performing calculations to deal with divergences. So B does require regularization.

QED (C) definitely requires regularization because of the infinities in loop diagrams. So C is out.

So the only option left is D: Classical Electrodynamics. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't have the same divergences that require regularization. Therefore, it never needs regularization at high energies.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, let us analyze each option:

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring Theory is a quantum theory of gravity that unifies fundamental forces. While it is a background-independent theory and incorporates gravity, it still involves divergences in certain calculations, such as perturbative expansions. Although regularization techniques are not always explicitly required in the same way as in other quantum field theories, the theory can still encounter divergences that necessitate some form of regularization. Thus, it is not entirely free of regularization requirements.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and a non-abelian gauge theory. It is a renormalizable theory, meaning standard renormalization techniques can be applied. However, regularization is still required during calculations to handle divergences, such as those in loop diagrams. Therefore, QCD does require regularization.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is the theory of electromagnetism and a well-understood, renormalizable quantum field theory. It is notorious for requiring regularization due to divergences in loop diagrams, such as vacuum polarization and other quantum effects. Techniques like dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization are commonly used. Thus, QED definitely requires regularization.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical Electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory that describes electromagnetic interactions. Since it is not a quantum field theory, it does not encounter the same divergences or infinities that require regularization. Classical ED is formulated without regularization because it operates in the classical regime, where such issues do not arise. Therefore, it never requires regularization at high energies.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only Classical Electrodynamics (D) is a theory that never requires regularization at high energies.
