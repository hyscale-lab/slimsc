Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. What will be the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Alright, so first, I need to think about what's happening here. We're dealing with a titration of acetic acid (a weak acid) with NaOH (a strong base). The initial solution is diluted, then titrated. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let's break it down into parts.

First, I'll calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Then, determine how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence. For each of these points, I'll calculate the pH.

Wait, but wait. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Find the equivalence point volume.
3. Determine the volume of NaOH at 25% titration and at equivalence.
4. For each point, determine the concentrations of the species present (like [A-], [HA], etc.) and calculate pH.

Hmm. Let's get started.

Step 1: Initial concentration after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.040 L.

Molarity after dilution = (M1 * V1) / V2
M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L, V2 is 0.040 L.

So M = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Wait, let me check: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Step 2: Find the equivalence point volume.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially present.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.040 L.

Moles = 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait. The initial solution is 40 cm³, and we add 10 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, wait, when titrating, the NaOH is added to the solution, so the total volume increases. But when calculating, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

So, moving on.

Step 3: 25% Titration.

25% of the equivalence volume is used. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Let me compute moles of NaOH added: M * V = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

Since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of CH3COOH neutralized are 0.00025, and moles of CH3COO^- formed are 0.00025.

Wait, the initial moles of CH3COOH were 0.001. So after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume now is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the solution is in buffer region, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the ratio calculation.

0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) = -0.477.

So the pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, about 4.26. So the first pH is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base) in water. This will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate ions: 0.001 moles, as all acetic acid has been neutralized.

The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + equivalence volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion (A-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of A- is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be [OH-] produced.

Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] ≈ (x)(x)/(0.02) = x² /0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's about 9.02, but none of the options have a pH near 9. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 *1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb is correct.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute it more accurately.

sqrt(1.081e-11) → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so 1.04e-5.5?

Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Hmm, wait 1e-5 is (1e-5)^2=1e-10. 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 1e-5.5 is between, but perhaps a better way: 1.081e-11 = 1.081 *1e-11.

sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.04 (since 1.04^2=1.0816), so sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.45? Wait no, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. So 1e-5.5 is approx 3.16e-6. Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

Wait, 1.081e-11 = 1.081 * 1e-11.

Let me compute the square root of 1.081: approx 1.04.

So x ≈ 1.04e-5.5 → wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6 (since 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-5 is 1e-5). Wait, 1e-5.5 is approximately 3.16e-6.

So 1.04e-5.5 is 1.04 *3.16e-6 = approx 3.29e-6.

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) = 1.04 * 1e-5.5 ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 = approx 3.29e-6.

Wait, but earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recompute.

Wait, 1e-11 is 10^-11, so the square root is 10^(-5.5), which is approximately 3.16e-6.

So 1.081e-11 → square root is sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 → 1.04 *3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6.

So [OH-] is approximately 3.29e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29)=0.517, so pOH≈5.483.

pH =14 -5.483 =8.517.

Ah, so about 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 9, but that was a mistake in the exponent. So the correct pH is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the Kb.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is 0.02 M in acetate.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-9)/(1.85) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

Using the approximation that x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), then x² = Kb * C → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02.

So x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.5? Wait, no, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. Wait, but 1.04e-5.5 would be 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6.

Wait, but x is [OH-], so [OH-] = 3.29e-6, so pOH is about 5.48, pH is about 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is about 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 (25% titration) and 8.52 (equivalence point). Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but another thought: when we reach the equivalence point, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a basic solution. So the pH should be around 8.52, which is in line with option A.

But wait, another check: perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration.

Wait, wait, 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. The initial volume is 40 cm³, so adding 2.5 cm³ makes 42.5 cm³.

So the moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So after reaction, moles of acetic acid: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

Log(0.333) is -0.477.

So pH=4.733 - 0.477 =4.256 ≈4.26.

Yes, that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Yes.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the equivalence pH can vary. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: when all the acid is neutralized, the solution is 0.02 M in acetate. The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb)

Wait, wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, using the formula for a weak base.

But I think the way I did it earlier is correct.

So, the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid (a weak acid) with sodium hydroxide (a strong base) at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution**
- Initial volume of acetic acid: \( 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.020 \, \text{L} \)
- Initial concentration of acetic acid: \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \)
- After dilution with \( 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of water, the total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.040 \, \text{L} \).

Using the dilution formula:
\[
\text{Molarity after dilution} = \frac{\text{Initial moles}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.020}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: Equivalence point calculation**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of acetic acid initially present are:
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]
Since the reaction is \( 1:1 \), the moles of \( \text{NaOH} \) required are also \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \). The volume of \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \, \text{NaOH} \) needed is:
\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

---

### **Step 3: pH at 25% titration**
At 25% titration, \( 25\% \) of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added:
\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0025 \, \text{L}.
\]
The moles of \( \text{NaOH} \) added are:
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]
Since \( \text{NaOH} \) reacts with acetic acid in a \( 1:1 \) ratio:
- Remaining moles of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \): \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \),
- Moles of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \) formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).

The total volume is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

---

### **Step 4: pH at the equivalence point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The solution contains \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \) in a total volume of:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]
The concentration of acetate ions is:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The \( \text{K}_b \) for this reaction is:
\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]
Using the approximation \( \text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):
\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
