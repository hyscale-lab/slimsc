Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.

The question states that astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power (1/plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance, r. The options are different power laws related to r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the relationship between parallax and distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), so distance is 1 / plx. So, plx is inversely proportional to r; as r increases, plx decreases.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But I need to relate this to distance, since the question is about how N changes with r. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that into the equation might help.

Wait, plx = 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx)^5 would be (r)^5. Because (1/plx)^5 = (r)^5.

So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, that's the same as N ∝ r^5. Oh, so the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

But wait, wait a second. No, wait. Let me think again. Because parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r. So plx = k / r, where k is some constant. So 1/plx = r/k. So when you have 1/plx^5, that would be (r/k)^5, which is r^5 times a constant (like 1/k^5). So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, what does the question mean by "per unit range of distance"? Hmm. Oh, I think it's referring to the number density of stars in a given distance range. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance (like per parsec or something). So maybe I have to consider how N changes as we move a little bit in distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a volume of space depends on r. Let's think about volume. Suppose you have a region of the sky, so it's a thin slice, and we're looking at the number of stars in that slice as a function of distance. The volume would be area times distance. But wait, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So how does that translate to distance.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's think of N(r) dr, the number of stars between r and r+dr. If N varies as 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r, so 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So N(r) dr is proportional to r^5 dr?

But wait, no, because the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is also dependent on the area. The area depends on the solid angle, but perhaps the question is assuming a fixed region of the sky, so the solid angle is constant. So the number of stars would be N(r) dr = (constant) * r^2 * r^5 dr, because the number density (stars per volume) times the volume (r^2 * dr, since it's a spherical shell area? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5.

So as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. So the answer would be something like proportional to r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5.

Wait, but another thought: the number of stars in a unit distance interval. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance would be proportional to r^5, right? Because if N increases as r^5, then for each additional unit of r, you get more stars. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^5.

So the correct answer should be B) ~ r^5.

The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the equation, \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} = r^5 \). Therefore, the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. This implies that the number of stars increases with \( r^5 \) as \( r \) increases. Among the given options, the correct relationship is \( N \propto r^5 \).

Answer: B
