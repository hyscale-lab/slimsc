Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about orthophosphate ions and buffer solutions, I think. Let me read it through again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients are near 1? Not sure if that matters here.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in the solution. Oh wait, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated, the species change. So, the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, right? So, H3PO4 is triprotic. It can lose three protons, so the species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate typically refers to H3PO4, but the options are in the order of 1e-7, which is way smaller than the Ka values. Hmm, maybe they mean PO4^3-, but I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-? Or maybe the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2-? Wait, no, because the options are in the 1e-7 range, which is about Ka3.

Let me think about the species present. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (and water of course). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That looks like a buffer system between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). Because each of these can donate or accept protons.

Wait, but wait. The buffer system here is for the second dissociation of H3PO4. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. So the buffer system is for the second dissociation, between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-, the species from the third dissociation. Since PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, its concentration is determined by the third dissociation, which is very small because Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So PO4^3- should be very low in concentration.

Wait, but how do we calculate it? Because we can't directly compute the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- without considering the buffer solution. But if we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps they form a buffer, and the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then, knowing the pH, we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using Ka3.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- in solution.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.
2. Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.
4. Use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.

Wait, but maybe it's better to approach it by considering that the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will determine the pH, and then from that pH, find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me start with step 1.

First, calculate moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol.

Assuming that the solution volume is 200 mL, the concentrations (molarity) would be:

Concentration of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) = 0.005610 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02805 M.

Now, the buffer pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where A^- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.02805 / 0.036725).

Calculating the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7648.

log(0.7648) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 ≈ 7.093.

So the pH is approximately 7.093.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], which comes from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.093, we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But [H+] can be calculated from pH: [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * [HPO4^2-] / (8.29e-8).

But [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait. The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M, but in reality, some of it will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So should I consider that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02805 M, and the change is negligible? Because Ka3 is very small, the dissociation is minimal, so the approximation should hold.

So, substituting the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.29e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. That's around 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, let's compute [H+] again. pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093.

Let me compute that more accurately. 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-0.093 is approximately 0.83. So 1e-7 * 0.83 ≈ 8.3e-8. So that part is correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.3e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.3e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.3e-8 = (5.049 / 8.3) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.608 * 1e-6 = 6.08e-7 M.

So approximately 6.08e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Hmm.

But wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake in considering the contribution of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to the solution. Because when calculating pH, I used the initial concentrations, but perhaps I should consider that some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But since the K_a values are very small, the changes would be minimal.

Wait, but in this buffer solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a buffer; the pH calculated using their initial concentrations is accurate because the dissociation is minimal.

So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the total concentration of phosphate in solution can come from both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the orthophosphate is the PO4^3-.

Wait no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's deprotonated, so the species are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

So, the problem is specifically about PO4^3-.

So, according to my calculation, it's around 6.08e-7 M, but the closest option is A) 6.24e-7. Hmm. Let me see if I can get a more precise value.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.036725.

Calculating that: 0.02805 / 0.036725 ≈ let's compute it as 2805/3672.5 = approx 0.7646.

So log(0.7646) is approximately?

Since log(0.75) is about -0.1249, and log(0.76) is about -0.1189.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Using log(0.7646) = log(7.646e-1).

Using the formula for logarithms, or using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute as follows.

Let me think: 10^x = 0.7646.

We know that 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.7646.

Because 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 10^(-0.115) is about 0.7646.

So the pH is 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093.

But perhaps I can compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.093 → [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^(-0.093) is approximately 0.829.

So [H+] ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So, plugging into the [PO4^3-] calculation:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02805 / (8.29e-8) = (5.049e-14) / 8.29e-8 = 5.049e-14 / 8.29e-8.

Dividing 5.049e-14 by8.29e-8:

5.049 /8.29 ≈ 0.608.

And 1e-14 /1e-8 =1e-6.

So 0.608e-6 → 6.08e-7 M.

Hmm, but option A is 6.24e-7. Is that close enough, or did I make an error somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- contribute to the [H+] via their own dissociations, but I think that in buffer solutions, the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, so the approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact value using more precise calculations.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M, and [H+] is 8.29e-8 M.

Wait, so [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 8.29e-8.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.29e-8) = (5.049e-14) / (8.29e-8) = (5.049 /8.29) * 1e-6 → 0.608 * 1e-6 = 6.08e-7.

So 6.08e-7 M, which is approximately 6.08e-7.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M.

B) 5.48e-7.

C)2.81e-7.

D)3.97e-7.

So the closest is A. But wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Volume is 200 cm³ → 0.2 L.

So concentration is 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005610 mol.

Concentration is 0.005610 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

That's correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is 7.208.

Ratio is 0.02805 / 0.036725 = 0.7646.

Log(0.7646): Let me calculate it more accurately.

Using logarithm properties:

log(0.7646) = log(7646 × 1e-4) = log(7646) -4.

Wait, maybe better to use log(0.7646) ≈ ?

Alternatively, using calculator-like approach:

We know that 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.7646.

So, pH is 7.208 -0.115 = 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.29e-8.

So, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the solution's total phosphate comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, but wait, no, the problem is only about PO4^3-.

Wait another thought: when calculating [PO4^3-], is it from the HPO4^2- dissociation, which is (HPO4^2- ) * Ka3 / [H+] ?

Yes, which is correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is not exactly 0.02805 M because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the dissociation is minimal. So, the approximation holds.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the exact [HPO4^2-] after considering dissociation.

Let me set up an ICE table for the HPO4^2- dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Initial concentration: [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M; [H+] = 8.29e-8 M; [PO4^3-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 - x ≈ 0.02805 (since x is very small).

[H+] is given as 8.29e-8.

So, Ka3 = (8.29e-8)(x) / (0.02805) = 1.8e-12.

Solving for x:

x = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.29e-8) → same as before, 6.08e-7 M.

So, the approximation holds.

Thus, [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.08e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 6.08e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is about 2.5% higher. Did I make a miscalculation?

Let me recheck the exact calculations.

Let me compute the ratio again:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.76466.

Log(0.76466) is approximately:

Using calculator, log(0.76466) = ?

Log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.8)= -0.0969.

0.76466 is between 0.7 and 0.8. Let me compute it more precisely.

Using linear approximation isn't accurate, but perhaps using a Taylor series or other method.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

log(x) ≈ ln(x)/ln(10).

ln(0.76466) ≈ ln(0.76) ≈ -0.2746.

So, log(x) ≈ (-0.2746)/2.3026 ≈ -0.119.

So, pH =7.208 - 0.119 =7.089.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.089) = 8.31e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.31e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.31e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.31e-8 = (5.049 /8.31) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.31 = approx 0.6075.

So, 0.6075e-6 → 6.075e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.075e-7, which is about 6.08e-7.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (6.24e-7), but wait, let me check option D: 3.97e-7. Hmm, that's half of what I have. Maybe I made a mistake in a step.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the buffer equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system uses pKa2, which is correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, but no, the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer solution and is treating each salt separately. But that doesn't make sense because the presence of both salts creates a buffer.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution's pH is around 7, which is just below the pKa3 of HPO4^2-.

Wait, pKa3 is about 12. So, pH 7 is much lower, so the degree of dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- would be very low, which aligns with the small Ka3.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Let me compute the ratio again with more precision.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.036725.

0.02805 / 0.036725 = (2805 / 36725) = 0.07646.

Wait, wait, no. 2805 / 36725 is 0.07646? Wait, 36725 is about 36.725, so 2805 / 36725 → 2805 ÷ 36725. Let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 36725 is 36725 = 36725.

Wait, 2805 ÷ 36725 = 2805/(36725) → let me compute this as a decimal.

Compute 36725 × 0.076 = 36725 * 0.07 = 2570.75; 36725 * 0.006 = 220.35 → total 2791.1. So 0.076 gives 2791.1, which is less than 2805.

The difference is 2805 - 2791.1 = 13.9.

So, 13.9 / 36725 ≈ ~0.00038.

So, total is approximately 0.076 + 0.00038 ≈ 0.07638.

Wait, so the ratio is 0.07638. Hmm, wait that can't be right because earlier I thought it was around 0.764.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the decimal placement. Let me compute 0.02805 / 0.036725.

0.02805 / 0.036725 = (28.05e-3) / (36.725e-3) )= 28.05 /36.725 ≈ 0.7646.

Ah, that's where the 0.7646 comes from. So earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, so the initial calculations are correct, and the answer is around 6.08e-7 M. But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option A (6.24e-7), which is about 2.6% higher.

But perhaps I should recheck the moles.

Wait, 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 /177.99 = approximately 0.005610 mol.

So, 0.005610 mol in 0.2 L → 0.02805 M.

Yes, correct.

Similarly, KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol → 0.036725 M.

Correct.

Another thought: Maybe the question is using the exact concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to compute the pH, but perhaps I should consider that the solution's total volume is 200 mL, and the sum of the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is the total phosphate.

But no, the problem is about PO4^3-, which is a separate species.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without the Henderson-Hasselbalch approximation.

The buffer pH is determined by:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [HPO4^2-]. Let me recheck.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 is approximately 178 g/mol.

1.00 /178 = 0.005618 mol; in 0.2 L → 0.02809 M.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the solution is more complex, considering that both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can affect the H+ concentration beyond what the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation accounts for.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is an approximation that works well for weak acids and their conjugate bases in a buffer system, especially when the concentrations are not extremely different. Here, the ratio is about 0.76, which is within acceptable limits for the approximation.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by both the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But no, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-, but HPO4^2- can donate a proton to form PO4^3-.

So, perhaps I should model it as a system where both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- contribute to the H+ concentration.

Wait, but that's more complicated. Let me think.

The total H+ concentration in solution is determined by the dissociation of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, as well as water autoionization.

But considering the buffer solution, the H+ concentration is dominated by the buffer, so the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the main contributors to [H+].

But perhaps the exact [H+] is a bit more involved.

Let me model the system as:

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So, the total [H+] can be found by considering both equilibria.

Let me denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b, [PO4^3-] = c.

From the initial moles, a = 0.036725 M, b =0.02805 M. But these will change due to dissociation.

At equilibrium:

For the first dissociation (H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-):

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So, a ≈ 0.036725 - x ≈ 0.036725 (since x is small, because Ka2 is 6.2e-8).

Similarly, for the second dissociation (HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-):

Change: -y, +y, +y.

So, b ≈ 0.02805 - y ≈ 0.02805.

But considering that x and y are small, their impact on a and b is negligible.

So, the total [H+] is approximately equal to x + y.

But wait, another approach: the [H+] can be found from the first dissociation:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

And from the second dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can write:

Ka2 = [H+] * (b + [HPO4^2- from dissociation of H2PO4^-]) / (a - [H2PO4^- dissociated]).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to set up equations.

Let me define:

Let [H+] = h.

From the first dissociation:

Ka2 = h * (b + (h * a / Ka2)) / a.

Wait, perhaps that's too involved.

Alternatively, considering that [H+] is determined mainly by the buffer (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-), the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation holds, and the contribution from the HPO4^2- dissociation is negligible because Ka3 is much smaller.

So, perhaps the initial approach was correct.

But in that case, why is my calculated value not matching any of the options closely?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the solution is a buffer for the third dissociation, which is not the case.

Wait, no. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-, which has a very small Ka3.

So, in the buffer solution, the H+ comes mainly from the second dissociation (H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-).

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the exact [H+] using both equilibria.

Let me set up the equations.

Equation 1: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

Equation 2: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

Let me assume that [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 + x, and [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 - x, where x is the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates to form HPO4^2- and H+.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expressions in terms of [H+] and solve.

Let me denote:

[H+] = h.

From equation 1:

Ka2 = h * (0.02805 + (h * 0.036725 / Ka2 )) / (0.036725 - (h * 0.036725 / Ka2 )).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use the buffer solution pH and proceed, as the initial approach is the most straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- that dissociates into PO4^3- as follows:

At pH 7.093, the [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the Ka3 value. Oh wait, the problem states that the Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recompute:

Ka3 * [HPO4^2- ] / [H+].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2- ] = 0.02805 M.

[H+] =8.29e-8 M.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.29e-8) = (5.049e-14) / (8.29e-8) = 5.049e-14 / 8.29e-8.

Compute 5.049e-14 /8.29e-8 = (5.049 / 8.29) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.29 is approximately 0.608.

So 0.608e-6 → 6.08e-7 M.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7. But my calculation gives 6.08e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the pH more precisely.

The pH calculation: Let me compute the log(0.7646) more precisely.

Using a calculator, log(0.7646) is approximately:

I know that log(0.75) is about -0.1249, and log(0.76) is about -0.1189.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, log(0.7646) is approximately:

Using the formula:

The exact value can be found using a calculator, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can approximate it as follows.

We know that 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.7646.

But to be precise, 10^(-0.115) is approximately:

Compute 10^(-0.115) = 10^(-0.1) * 10^(-0.015).

10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.7943.

10^(-0.015) ≈ 0.9655.

Multiply: 0.7943 * 0.9655 ≈ 0.767.

Wait, but 0.767 is higher than 0.7646.

So 10^(-0.115) = ~0.767.

But we need 0.7646.

So, perhaps the exponent is a bit higher than -0.115.

Let me try -0.116.

10^(-0.116) = 10^(-0.1) * 10^(-0.016).

10^(-0.016) is about 0.967.

So 0.7943 * 0.967 ≈ 0.767 * 0.967 → Wait, no. 0.7943 * 0.967.

0.7943 * 0.96 → ~0.762.

0.7943 * 0.007 → ~0.00556.

Total ≈ 0.762 + 0.00556 ≈ 0.76756. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better method.

Alternatively, let's use the Taylor series expansion for log(x) around x=1.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approximation.

In any case, the pH is approximately 7.093, leading to [H+] of ~8.29e-8.

So, the calculated [PO4^3-] is 6.08e-7 M.

But the closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol again.

136.09 g/mol: 1.00 /136.09 = approx 0.007345 mol.

Yes, correct.

Similarly, 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005610 mol.

Yes.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D at 3.97e-7. But that's not close to my calculation. So, I'm not sure. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion? No, that's not correct. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not referring to the concentration of free PO4^3- but the total concentration from both salts. But that doesn't make sense because the question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is lower than I thought, leading to a higher [PO4^3-].

Wait, wait, another thought: the calculation of [PO4^3-] is based on [HPO4^2-] and [H+], but perhaps the actual [HPO4^2-] is less than 0.02805 M because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

So, let me consider that [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 - x, where x is the amount that dissociates.

But since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, x will be very small, so 0.02805 - x ≈ 0.02805.

Thus, the initial approximation holds.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.08e-7 M, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7, which is 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, 5.049e-14 /8.29e-8 = ?

5.049e-14 /8.29e-8 = (5.049 /8.29) x 1e-6.

5.049 divided by 8.29:

5.049 /8.29.

Let me compute 8.29 * 0.6 = 4.974.

5.049 -4.974 = 0.075.

0.075 /8.29 ≈ 0.009.

So, total is approximately 0.609.

Thus, 0.609e-6 → 6.09e-7.

So, 6.09e-7 M.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is not a buffer for the second dissociation. Could it be a buffer for the first dissociation?

No, because the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are from the first and second dissociations, so it's a buffer for the second.

Another thought: perhaps the molecular weights are incorrect. Let me recheck.

KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2 is 2(1.008)=2.016, P is30.97, O4 is 64.00. So 39.10 +2.016 +30.97 +64 = 136.086 → 136.09 g/mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2 *22.99=45.98. HPO4^3-: H is 1.008, P is30.97, O4 is64. So HPO4^3- is 1.008 +30.97 + 64 = 96. So Na2HPO4 is 45.98 +96=141.98 g/mol. Plus 2H2O: 2*(18.015)=36.03. So total is 141.98 +36.03=178.01 g/mol. The problem says 177.99, so correct.

Hmm.

I think I've considered all possibilities. Perhaps the answer is option A, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, another approach: calculate the exact pH using the accurate ratio.

The ratio is 0.02805 /0.036725 = 0.76466.

Log(0.76466) is approximately -0.115.

So pH =7.208 -0.115=7.093.

So [H+] =10^-7.093=8.29e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805 ) /8.29e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02805=5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.29e-8=6.08e-7.

So, the answer is 6.08e-7, which isn't an option. The closest is A)6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial step. Let me compute 1.8e-12 *0.02805.

1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = (1.8 *0.02805 )e-12= 0.05049e-12=5.049e-14.

Divided by 8.29e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.29e-8 = (5.049 /8.29 ) *1e-6=0.608 *1e-6=6.08e-7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that some of the H2PO4^- also contributes to PO4^3- via the second and third dissociation steps.

But given the very small Ka3, that's negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total concentration of phosphate species, but that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D:3.97e-7, but I can't see how that would arise from the calculations.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- without considering the buffer and just calculated the concentration of PO4^3- based on each.

But that approach wouldn't make sense, as the pH is determined by the buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have you calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer, and then proceed to find PO4^3- from that.

But that's what I've done.

I think I've hit a dead end. My calculation leads to approximately 6.08e-7 M, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I should recheck the pH calculation using more precise values.

Let me recompute log(0.76466) accurately.

The exact value can be found using a calculator, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use a more precise approach.

We know that:

log(0.7)= -0.1549

log(0.75)= -0.1249

log(0.76466)= ?

Using linear approximation between 0.75 and 0.76.

At 0.75, log is -0.1249.

At 0.76: compute log(0.76).

0.76 is 0.76.

We can compute log(0.76) using the Taylor series expansion of log(x) around x=0.75.

Let me set x=0.76, a=0.75.

log(x) ≈ log(a) + (x-a)/a * (1/(ln(10))) ).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a linear approximation.

The derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln(10)).

So, the slope at x=0.75 is 1/(0.75 * ln(10)) ≈ 1/(0.75*2.3026) ≈ 1/(1.72695) ≈ 0.579.

So, from x=0.75 (log=-0.1249) to x=0.76 (Δx=0.01), the change in log(x) is approximately 0.01 * 0.579 = 0.00579.

So, log(0.76) ≈ -0.1249 + 0.00579 = -0.1191.

Now, 0.76466 is 0.76 + 0.00466.

Δx=0.00466.

At x=0.76, the slope is 1/(0.76 * ln(10)) ≈ 1/(0.76 *2.3026 )≈1/(1.7499)≈0.572.

So, Δlog ≈ 0.00466 * 0.572 ≈ 0.00267.

So, log(0.76466) ≈ -0.1191 + 0.00267 ≈ -0.1164.

So, pH =7.208 -0.1164=7.0916.

So, [H+]=10^(-7.0916)=10^(-7) *10^(-0.0916).

Compute 10^(-0.0916)= approximately 0.816.

So, 1e-7 *0.816=8.16e-8.

Then, [PO4^3- ]= (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.16e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02805=5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.16e-8:

5.049e-14 /8.16e-8 = (5.049/8.16) *1e-6.

5.049 ÷8.16 ≈0.6187.

So, 0.6187e-6=6.187e-7 M.

Hmm, that's 6.19e-7, which is even closer to option A (6.24e-7).

So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But why is there a slight discrepancy?

Well, perhaps due to rounding during calculations.

So, the best option is A)6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Solution Composition**:  
   - Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L.  
   - Mass of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g, Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol.  
   - Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g, Mw = 177.99 g/mol.  

2. **Moles and Concentrations**:  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M} \).  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005610 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005610}{0.2} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M} \).  

3. **Buffer System and pH Calculation**:  
   The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, forming a buffer system for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
   \[
   \text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}, \, K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
   \]  
   - \( \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \).  
   - Ratio \( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.036725} \approx 0.7646 \).  
   - \( \log(0.7646) \approx -0.115 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093 \).  

4. **Concentration of PO₄³⁻**:  
   The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
   \[
   \text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \, K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
   \]  
   Using the expression for \( K_a3 \):  
   \[
   K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
   \]  
   - \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}}.
     \]  
     - Numerator: \( 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.02805 \approx 5.049 \times 10^{-14} \).  
     - Denominator: \( 8.29 \times 10^{-8} \).  
     - \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).  

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.08 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). The closest option is **A) \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**, which is within a reasonable margin of error due to approximations in calculations.

**Answer: A**
