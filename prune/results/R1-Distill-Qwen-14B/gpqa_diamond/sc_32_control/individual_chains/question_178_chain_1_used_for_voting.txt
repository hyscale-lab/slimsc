Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So the first step is probably to figure out the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian.

Wait, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian itself should be [L] = [Mass]^4 because the action S = ∫ L d^4x has to be dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down L_int. It's κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}. Let me find the dimensions of each part.

First, what's the dimension of ψ? Fermion fields ψ usually have mass dimension 3/2. Because in a renormalizable theory, the mass term for a Dirac field is m ψ̄ ψ, and the mass m has dimension 1. Since [m] =1, and [ψ][ψ̄] must be 1 as well because [ψ̄ ψ] = [Mass]^1. So ψ has dimension (3/2).

So ψ̄ would also be 3/2, because it's the adjoint spinor.

Next, σ_{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices γ_μ are dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So σ_{μν} would have the same dimension as [γ_μ][γ_ν], but since they're matrices without mass dimension, σ is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, but in the Lagrangian, F^{μν} would be for a gauge field like in Maxwell's theory. The field strength tensor F_{μν} has mass dimension 2, because F_{μν} ~ ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, and A has dimension 1. Because for a gauge field A, the kinetic term is ∂μ Aν ∂^μ A^ν, which must have dimension 4. So each A has dimension 1, because each derivative is dimension 1, so each ∂μ Aν term is (1 + 1) = 2, and the product when squared would give 4. So [F^{μν}] = [∂ A] = 1 +1 =2.

Putting it all together, L_int is the product κ * (ψ̄) * (σ_{μν}) * ψ * F^{μν}.

So each term's dimension:

κ is the coupling we need to find.

ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. σ is 0.

So the product is [κ] * (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, all terms in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so the entire L_int must have dimension 4.

So [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2.

Adding those up: (3/2 +3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5, so [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] must be -1.

So that gives [κ]=-1.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the F tensor's dimension. Wait, the field strength tensor F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each term in F has dimension [∂][A], which is 1 + [A]. Since A is a vector potential, which in 4D has dimension 1 (because the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, which must have dimension 4). So each A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1+1=2. So that part was correct.

So the dimension of the coupling κ is [κ] = -1.

Next, determining if the theory is renormalizable. The general rule is that an interaction term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the coupling has positive mass dimension. Wait, wait, no, the other way around. The dimension of the coupling is [κ] = d. If d is positive, the interaction is renormalizable. Because in terms of superficial degree of divergence, the interaction with coupling dimension d has a superficial degree D=4 - (d) * n, where n is the number of vertices. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram in a quantum field theory is given by D = 4 - (sum over each vertex of the coupling's dimension). So for a theory to be renormalizable, all the interactions must have couplings with dimension ≤4? Or is it that the coupling must have positive dimension, or not?

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence is D=4 - (sum over each vertex) [coupling]. So for the theory to be renormalizable, all D must be ≥0. So each coupling's dimension must be ≤4.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So if you have a vertex with this coupling, each such vertex contributes -1 to the sum. So for any diagram with n vertices, the contribution would be -n. So D=4 - (-n) =4 +n. Wait, that's a problem because as n increases, D increases, meaning that higher-order diagrams are more divergent. But that's the opposite of what we want.

Wait, wait. Maybe I mixed up the way the dimensions work. Let me think again. The coupling term in the Lagrangian is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The dimension of L is 4, as mentioned earlier. So each term in L must have dimension 4.

So each term is dimension-wise: [κ][ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = [Mass]^(-1) * [Mass]^(3/2) * [Mass]^0 * [Mass]^(3/2) * [Mass]^2. Adding exponents: (-1) + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2. That sums to (-1) +3 +2 → (-1 +5)=4. So that's correct.

But for renormalizability, the interaction term must be of the form that the coupling has positive mass dimension. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, that would imply that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait, no. Let's recall that in a renormalizable theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. But actually, each term must have exactly dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in 4D), so every term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, but that's correct. So the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is less than 4, but that's fine because the entire term is dimension 4. But the question is about the renormalizability. The coupling's dimension affects the renormalizability.

Wait, I think the key is that if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because the Feynman diagrams would lead to higher and higher divergences as the number of vertices increases, making the theory not renormalizable.

Wait, let me think about the superficial degree of divergence. The formula is D=4 - (sum of the [couplings]). Each vertex contributes [coupling] in terms of mass dimension. So for the vertex in this problem, each vertex (from L_int) contributes [κ] = -1. So for a diagram with V vertices, the sum is V*(-1). So D=4 - (-V) =4 +V. 

Since V is the number of vertices, which is at least 1. So for any diagram with V=1, D=5. Which is positive, so the diagram is divergent. But that's a problem because higher loops would have higher D, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, in renormalizable theories, the superficial degree of divergence D must be ≥0 for renormalizability? Or that the superficial degree of divergence must be ≤0 for the theory to be renormalizable?

No, I think the opposite. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the 1PI (one-particle irreducible) diagrams must have D ≤ 0. Because if D is positive, the diagram is superrenormalizable, which is okay, but if D is negative, it's higher divergence. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that in a renormalizable theory, the superficial degree of divergence D must be ≤ 0. Because if D is positive, the diagram is more divergent than a superficially divergent theory. So for a theory to be renormalizable, all D for all diagrams must be ≤0.

Wait, no. Let me think of another approach. The superficial degree of divergence is D = 4L - (sum for each vertex: (d_i) ), where d_i is the dimension of the coupling at each vertex. For the theory to be renormalizable, all D must be ≤0. Because if D is positive, the diagram is more divergent than superficially, leading to non-renormalizable theories.

Wait, but the formula is D = 4 - (sum of d_i for each vertex). Wait, no, that can't be. Let me recall the correct formula.

The superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram in a theory with fields and couplings is given by D = 4 - (sum for each vertex of the coupling's dimension) × (number of vertices) + (sum for each propagator of the field's dimension × number of propagators) × (−1)… Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. But since I can't, I'll try to remember.

Wait, no, another approach: Each internal line (propagator) contributes a factor of momentum to the integral, which is dimension 1. Each vertex contributes a factor of the coupling, which has a certain dimension. So for a diagram with V vertices, I vertices, and P propagators, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - V * d_κ + P * (field dimension).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the formula is D = 4 - (sum over vertices (mass dimension of coupling)).

So in this case, each vertex contributes [κ] = -1. So D =4 - V*(-1) =4 + V.

So for any V=1, D=5. For V=2, D=6, and so on. So D is always positive, meaning that the diagrams are more divergent as V increases, which is bad. That suggests the theory is non-renormalizable because the interactions lead to higher divergences, making the theory not renormalizable.

Because a renormalizable theory requires that D ≤ 0, so for all possible diagrams, D cannot be positive. But in our case, D is 4 + V, which is larger than zero for any V>0. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. So looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No.

Option B: [κ]=1, ren. Yes. But we found [κ]=-1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not ren. Yes.

Option D: [κ]=1, not ren. No.

So correct answer is C. The mass dimension is -1, theory is not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields and operators
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same mass dimension as $\psi$, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for the gauge field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a combination of gamma matrices and is dimensionless, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension $[\mathcal{L}] = 4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ is given by:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}.
\]

The mass dimension of this term is:

\[
[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = [\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]

Substituting the known dimensions:

\[
[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]

Since $[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = 4$, we solve for $[\kappa]$:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all couplings have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the superficial degree of divergence $D$ of Feynman diagrams satisfies $D \leq 0$, making the theory free of uncontrollable divergences.

For this interaction term, the coupling $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension, $[\kappa]_M = -1$. This implies that the superficial degree of divergence $D$ for Feynman diagrams increases with the number of vertices $V$:

\[
D = 4 - V \cdot [\kappa] = 4 - V \cdot (-1) = 4 + V.
\]

As $V$ increases, $D$ becomes increasingly positive, leading to higher divergences. This indicates that the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as shown above.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
