Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian and some options for the possible decay modes of the boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is important because that'll determine what particles it can decay into.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. So, the interaction term involves the boson field X and the fermion fields ψ_f. The term looks like λ times the fermion field and their Dirac adjoint, multiplied by (v + X). So this probably describes X coupling to fermions. The v might be some vacuum expectation value, but that's probably not super relevant for decay kinematics.

The key here is to find out which fermions X can couple to, and then figure out what decay channels are possible based on X's mass. Since the problem asks about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, I need to consider the fermions that X can interact with and whether their mass is less than half of X's mass (since for a decay to two particles, each must have energy less than the parent's mass divided by 2).

X's mass is 6 GeV. So any decay products must each have a mass less than 3 GeV. Because if the combined mass of the two particles is more than 6 GeV, the decay isn't possible. So for each fermion pair, I need to check if each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but fermions come in pairs, like quarks, leptons, etc. Let me list out the possible fermions and their masses. 

Quarks:
- Up (u) and Down (d) quarks: their masses are around a few MeV each. So way below 3 GeV. So uū and dđ pairs are possible.
- Strange (s) quark: around 100 MeV, so that's okay.
- Charm (c) quark: about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 *2 =3 GeV. Wait, but wait, the mass of the c quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV. So pair production would require twice that. 3 GeV is the maximum allowed. So 2 * 1.5 =3 GeV, so yes, c cbar is allowed. But wait, the X mass is 6 GeV, so each c is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 =3 GeV, which is exactly half of X's mass. So that's allowed.

Bottom (b) quark: around 4.5 GeV. Oh, so 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So b bbar decay is not allowed because 4.5 +4.5 =9 GeV>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Top quark is even heavier, around 173 GeV, so way beyond.

Leptons:
Electron (e^-): mass ~0.5 MeV. So e+ e- is definitely allowed.

Muon (mu^-): ~105.7 MeV, so 2*105.7 ~211 MeV <6 GeV. So mu+ mu- is allowed.

Tau (tau^-): ~1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 =3.56 GeV. That's more than 3 GeV, so 3.56 >3, so tau+ tau- is not allowed. Because 3.56 is greater than 3, so X can't decay into tau pairs.

Wait, wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV. Each tau is about 1.78, so 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, no, no, wait. The threshold for decay into two particles is that each particle's mass must be less than X's mass divided by 2. Because when X decays into two particles, each must have energy at least their rest mass. So, the maximum allowed mass for each would be 3 GeV. So tau is 1.78 GeV each, so 1.78 is less than 3 GeV, so tau+ tau- is allowed.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The total mass of the decay products can't exceed the parent's mass. So when X → f fbar, the sum of the rest masses must be ≤6 GeV. But when the two fermions are the same, and each has mass m, then 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So for each fermion f, if 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So for tau, m_tau ~1.78 GeV. 1.78 *2=3.56 GeV <6 GeV? Wait, 3.56 is less than 6, so that's okay. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, that's a mistake earlier. Because 3.56 GeV is less than 6, so the decay is allowed. Oh, so tau is allowed.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check the exact numbers. Let me think: X's mass is 6 GeV.

For each possible fermion pair:

- Up quark: m_u ~2.2 MeV → 2*2.2 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark: similar to up, allowed.
- Strange: m_s ~95-115 MeV → allowed.
- Charm: m_c ~1.27 GeV → 2*1.27 ≈2.54 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
- Bottom: m_b ~4.1-4.7 GeV → 2*4.7=9.4 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
- Top: way too heavy.

Leptons:

- Electron: 0.5 MeV → allowed.
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But wait, the problem is about the possible decay modes. So X can decay into any of the quark-antiquark pairs (uū, dđ, s sbar, c cbar) as long as their rest mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but the options given don't include all of these. Let me look at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but bottom quark is 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So that's not allowed. So option A is wrong because it includes b bbar.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, mu+, e+. So that's correct for quarks (c, s, u, d are allowed), and for leptons, tau, mu, e are allowed.

Wait, but wait, does X couple to all these fermions?

The Lagrangian is L = -λ_f f ψ̄_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ_f ψ̄_f. So X couples to the fermions ψ_f. So which fermions are included in this term?

Wait, perhaps the fermion fields ψ_f include all the possible fermions, but in reality, each fermion species (like up, down, strange, etc.) would have their own ψ_f, meaning X couples to each of them.

So the possible decay channels would include any fermion-antifermion pair where each has a mass below 3 GeV.

So in the options, option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So that's all allowed.

Option C includes top quark (t tbar), which is not allowed because m_t is about 173 GeV, way too heavy.

Option D includes b bbar, but that's not allowed, so D is wrong.

So looking back at the options, option B is X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait, what about the tau? Earlier I thought that 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV which is less than 6 GeV, so it's allowed. So tau is included in option B, which is correct.

But let me double-check. For example, if X is 6 GeV, and tau is 1.78 GeV, 1.78 *2 =3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

So the allowed decay channels are all the quarks (u, d, s, c), and the leptons (e, mu, tau).

So looking at the options, option B includes all of these.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The key is to identify which fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f\bar{f} \)) can result from the decay of \( X \), ensuring that the total mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \), the condition is \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \) and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \) and \( d \): \( m_u, m_d \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), much less than 3 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( s \): \( m_s \sim 95-115 \, \text{MeV} \), less than 3 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( c \): \( m_c \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \sim 2.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
   - \( b \): \( m_b \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \sim 8.2-9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.
   - \( t \): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far too heavy. Not allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed due to the extremely high mass of the top quark. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), as listed in **Option B**.
