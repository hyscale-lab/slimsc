Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a genetics experiment involving ligand and receptor constructs. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: The researcher is working with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the vector has both the ligand and the receptor ORFs.

Looking at the vector structure: The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand is first, then the receptor. Each has their own tags.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, possibly for expression. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the translation of the second gene without needing a second promoter. So the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor probably from the IRES, which is a weaker promoter, maybe, but allows for co-expression.

But wait, there are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272 cassette. I think that means that without Cre, the stop is in place, preventing expression. But when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the respective ORFs to be expressed.

So the setup is for a Cre-dependent expression. If Cre is present, the stop is removed, so the ligand and receptor are expressed. Otherwise, they're not.

The researcher made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression with Western blot. They transfected primary astrocytes. The blot shows actin as loading control. So after transfection, the proteins should be expressed, but in the Cre-expressing cells, right?

Wait, no. Because the vector is a bicistronic construct with the stop cassettes. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are not expressed because of the stop. But when Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, and the ORFs are expressed, leading to ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But then the researcher bred mice homozygous for the construct (so they have the vector in both alleles) in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and the Cre is under SOX10 regulation, I assume. So the SOX10-Cre mice express Cre in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. The idea is that in the neural crest cells, Cre is active, so the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of ligand and receptor.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP should fluoresce. So why isn't it green?

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is in the same cells, so autocrine might be possible. But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. Not sure how this explains the lack of signal.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct isn't properly trafficked, perhaps it doesn't reach the cell surface. But why would it be stuck? Maybe due to a mutation or incorrect targeting signal. But does that relate to the vector setup? The vector seems to have the ORF correctly placed, unless the eGFP is in the wrong place.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. IRES is before the receptor, so perhaps it's relying on the IRES element for expression. If the enhancer is missing, maybe expression isn't happening. But the vector was designed with promoters, so maybe the CBA and IRES are sufficient.

Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh wait! When a stop cassette is removed, the ORF must be correctly in frame. If the eGFP is in a different reading frame, the receptor won't be translated correctly. Because the stop cassette is lox2272, which is a different site than loxP. So if the vector is designed such that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is followed by a stop, and the receptor is also followed by a stop. But when Cre is present, it will remove the stop cassettes in a specific way.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recognized, and the stop cassette is excised. That would mean the ligand is expressed, and then the mCherry is not, because after ligand comes the stop, which is removed. Wait, no, wait. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Oh, wait, no. The ligand ORF is 5', then a stop with loxP, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is terminated, and mCherry is not expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the ligand is expressed, and then the mCherry is expressed as well? Because now the ORF continues.

Wait, no, that depends on how the cassettes are placed. Alternatively, perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then after the ligand ORF, the stop cassette is inserted, then the mCherry. So if the stop is in the way, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. So when Cre excises the stop, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion? Or perhaps the ligand is a separate ORF and the mCherry is another, but the stop is between them. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how the vector is constructed.

But the main issue is why the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. Because the construct is in the mouse, and the Cre is expressed in specific cells (neural crest), the receptor should be expressed in those cells, leading to eGFP expression.

But in the experiment, no green signal is observed. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Let's think about possible issues.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could happen if the lox sites are not correctly recombined. For example, using the wrong Cre variant or incorrect lox sites. Because the ligand's stop cassette is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant. Wait, lox2272 is a mutant version of loxP which can be used for different recombination. So if the vector has loxP and lox2272 in different places, would Cre (which is loxP-specific) recognize both?

Wait, standard Cre uses loxP sites. Lox2272 is a lox variant that can be used with Cre for different purposes, such as in the Cre/LoxP system, sometimes used for conditional expression or for excision in a specific orientation.

If the vector has a loxP stop cassette in the ligand region and a lox2272 stop cassette in the receptor region, then when Cre is expressed, it would only excise the loxP sites, not the lox2272 sites. Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272.

Wait, that's an important point. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutated version of loxP where the recognition is altered, so Cre won't cut it. So in the vector, the ligand's stop cassette is flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor's by lox2272.

So when Cre is expressed, it will excise the loxP cassette, but not the lox2272 cassette. So the ligand ORF would be expressed (since the stop is removed), and mCherry would be expressed (because the stop before it is removed). But the receptor's stop cassette (after the receptor ORF) is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor is not expressed. Therefore, the eGFP would not be expressed either, because the stop is still there.

Wait, but the vector has the receptor ORF, followed by a stop (lox2272), then eGFP. So the intended plan is that the stop would be removed when the correct Cre variant is used. But in this case, the researcher only used regular Cre, which can't cut lox2272. So the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed, and eGFP isn't either.

Therefore, the mice have the construct, but the Cre from SOX10-Cre is only able to excise the ligand's stop, allowing ligand expression (mCherry), but the receptor's stop remains, so receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So no green signal.

But wait, the question says the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the stop cassettes are arranged in a way that both can be removed with Cre. Hmm, but if the ligand's stop is loxP and the receptor's is lox2272, and Cre only cuts loxP, then only the ligand's stop is removed, leaving the receptor's stop intact.

Therefore, in the offspring, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry is expressed, but the question is about the green signal (eGFP) not being there.

So the reason is that the receptor's stop is not excised because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't recognize. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP is not expressed. So in the Western blot, they might have seen the ligand expressed, but not the receptor.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection to astrocytes. So in that experiment, the vector is transfected into astrocytes, which presumably don't express Cre. So the stop cassettes are in place, so neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the question says that the researcher used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct expression. Oh wait, maybe the cells were transfected without Cre, so no expression. But in the mouse model, the Cre is provided by SOX10-Cre, which would activate in neural crest cells.

But the key point is that the construct for the receptor uses lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the stop remains, preventing expression.

Looking back at the answer options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would happen if the stop cassette isn't excised and the ORF is cut incorrectly. Hmm, but the stop remains, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed at all. So perhaps the eGFP isn't made because the ORF is still blocked.

Alternatively, if the stop is removed, but the frames are not in phase, then the receptor and eGFP would be expressed but as a nonfunctional protein, but in the Western blot, they might detect it. But the question is about the absence of a signal in the confocal.

Wait, but the problem is that in the mouse, the Cre is introduced (from SOX10-Cre), which only excises the loxP stop cassette, not the lox2272. So the ligand is expressed (so you would see mCherry fluorescence, which is red), but the receptor is not. So in the confocal, you'd expect red but not green.

But the question is why the green isn't observed. So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette wasn't excised, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

So looking at the options, which option aligns with this reasoning.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be the case if the stop is excised but the frames are wrong, leading to a frameshift. But if the stop isn't excised, then the receptor isn't expressed at all.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct for the receptor has the stop in a way that without excision, the ORF is not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses lox2272 in a way that requires a different Cre variant to excise, but the researcher used regular Cre, which can't cut it. So the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the stop for the receptor isn't being excised because the lox sites are incompatible with Cre. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly say this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no, that's about the ORF. Alternatively, perhaps it's option C: enhancer missing. But the ligand is under a strong promoter, so I don't think that's the issue.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses two different stop cassettes. So to remove both, you need two different Cre variants. But the researcher only used one. Therefore, the ligand's stop is removed (allowing ligand expression), but the receptor's stop remains, so no eGFP.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, let me review the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Suppose that when Cre is present, the stop is removed, but the reading frame is messed up. So the ORF for the receptor would be in a wrong frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. But then, in the Western blot, perhaps the antibody would detect some protein, but it's not fluorescent.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because the frame is wrong. Thus, the eGFP isn't made, so no green signal.

But that would require that the lox2272 is correctly excised, which in this case, it's not because Cre doesn't recognize it. So the stop remains, so the ORF isn't even initiated.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Looking back, the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the vector is designed such that both cassettes are excised with Cre. But if the lox2272 is used, which isn't cut by Cre, then only the ligand's stop is excised.

Wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but it can be cut by Cre. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a lox variant that requires Cre, but perhaps in a different configuration. Or maybe it's a version that doesn't require Cre. Wait, no, lox2272 is a lox variant that can be used for excision with Cre, but it's directional.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on whether Cre can cut lox2272. From what I recall, Cre recognizes loxP sites. Lox2272 is a mutated version where the loxP site is altered, and Cre can't recognize it. So lox2272 is used in experiments where you want to prevent Cre from cutting. So if the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, Cre can't cut it, so the stop remains, preventing expression of the receptor and eGFP.

So then, in the mouse model, the ligand's stop is removed (allowing ligand expression), but the receptor's stop remains, preventing receptor expression. So in the offspring, only the ligand would be expressed, but not the receptor. Therefore, in the confocal, the eGFP (from the receptor) wouldn't be seen.

So why is this happening? Because the lox sites are different, and Cre can only cut loxP. So the stop before the receptor isn't removed, hence no eGFP.

Looking back at the options, which one explains this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean a frameshift, but that's not the case here. The stop isn't excised, so the ORF isn't even translated.

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which should be sufficient.

Option B says the construct is stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is expressed, but not trafficked, then eGFP wouldn't be seen. But in this scenario, the receptor isn't expressed at all.

So the correct answer is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options directly state this. Wait, perhaps option D is about the reading frame being wrong because the stop wasn't removed, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question states that the stop in the ligand is loxP, and the stop in the receptor is lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it can only remove the loxP stop, not the lox2272. So the receptor's stop remains, preventing its expression. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that in the vector, the ligand's stop can be removed, but the receptor's stop can't because Cre doesn't cut lox2272. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly address this. The closest is option D, but that's about frame. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But that's about trafficking, not expression.

Wait, another thought: when you have a bicistronic vector with two stops, and only one is removed, the second ORF isn't expressed. So in this case, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop wasn't excised. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't seen.

Wait, the vector is designed so that both the ligand and the receptor are co-expressed when Cre is present. But in this case, only the ligand is expressed because the receptor's stop isn't removed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, which option explains this? The options don't directly mention the lox site issue. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But that would require that the ORF is messed up, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stop isn't being excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options address this. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, the question states that the vector has the ligand at 5', with a stop, and the receptor at 3', with another stop. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed. But if the stops are flanked by different lox sites, only one is removed.

In this case, the ligand's stop (loxP) is removed, so ligand is expressed. The receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't removed, so receptor isn't expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't made. Therefore, the answer should explain that the stop for the receptor wasn't removed. But none of the options directly say this.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D says receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop is removed but the frame is wrong, the receptor would be expressed but as a nonfunctional protein. But the eGFP would not be expressed unless it's part of the same ORF.

Wait, the vector places the receptor ORF followed by a stop and eGFP. So if the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed as a fusion? Or are they separate?

Ah, the vector has the receptor ORF, then a stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, and then the eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF. So the eGFP would be expressed as a separate protein.

But if the stop isn't removed (as in our case), the receptor isn't expressed, and the eGFP is also not expressed because the stop is in place.

So, in the mouse model, the Cre can only remove the ligand's stop. So ligand is expressed, but not the receptor or eGFP.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop before the receptor wasn't removed. Which option matches this?

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But this would mean that when the stop is removed, their ORFs are not in frame, causing a frameshift. But in reality, if the stop is removed, the ORF would be in the same frame. So in our case, the stop is not removed, so the receptor is not expressed. So perhaps the correct answer is D because when the stop is removed, the frame is wrong, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the IRES is not working. But the question says the receptor is under the IRES, which should allow its expression.

Another angle: the vector is designed with lox sites that prevent the correct expression. For instance, if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, but that's more about the vector construction.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer in option C is missing. But the ligand is under a strong promoter, so the enhancer shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the stop is removed, the eGFP would be expressed as a separate ORF. But if the ORF continues, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed. But that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the eGFP is in a separate ORF, which the stop allows. So without excision, eGFP isn't expressed.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible reasons why the eGFP isn't expressed.

If the stop before the receptor isn't removed, then the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So the reason is that the stop wasn't excised because the lox sites are incompatible with Cre. So the correct answer is not among the options. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the options include option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weak promoter, but should still allow expression when the stop is removed. So perhaps the enhancer is needed, but that's not part of the vector, so the expression isn't happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector doesn't have the necessary regulatory elements beyond the promoter and IRES.

Hmm, but the question is about the mouse construct, so perhaps the expression is relying on the endogenous regulatory elements, which are not present, so the enhancer is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer is present, but in the wrong location.

This is getting quite complicated. Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because when the stop isn't excised, the ORF is cut, leading to no expression.

Wait, but without the stop, the ORF is continuous, so the receptor is expressed, and then eGFP is expressed as another ORF. So why wouldn't that happen? Because in this case, the stop isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't either.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But that would require the receptor to be expressed and then mislocalized. But in this case, the receptor isn't even made.

I'm going to make an educated guess. The correct answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Because the stop wasn't excised, the ORF isn't correctly translated, leading to no expression of the receptor and eGFP.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and a receptor, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under the IRES regulatory element. The ligand ORF is flanked by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor ORF is flanked by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, but no green fluorescence (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - The ligand ORF is flanked by loxP sites, which can be excised by Cre, allowing ligand expression.
   - The receptor ORF is flanked by lox2272 sites, which are not recognized by standard Cre recombinase. Thus, the receptor ORF remains blocked, preventing receptor and eGFP expression.

2. **Expression Outcomes**:
   - In the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre), the ligand ORF is expressed, but the receptor ORF remains unexpressed due to the unexcised lox2272 stop cassette.
   - As a result, the receptor and eGFP are not produced, leading to the absence of green fluorescence in the confocal microscope.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: "Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship" is irrelevant because the question focuses on expression issues, not functional interactions.
   - **Option B**: "The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi" is incorrect because the receptor and eGFP are not expressed at all, as evidenced by the lack of fluorescence.
   - **Option C**: "The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing" is unlikely because the ligand is under a strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which should allow expression if the stop cassette is removed.
   - **Option D**: "The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame" is the most plausible explanation. If the stop cassette is not excised, the ORF is interrupted, preventing proper translation of the receptor and eGFP. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is not expressed.

### Conclusion:
The absence of green fluorescence is due to the receptor and eGFP not being expressed, which is explained by the receptor ORF not being in the correct reading frame due to the unexcised lox2272 stop cassette. 

Answer: D
