Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and each gives two pH values.

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction between them should be a neutralization reaction. The first step is to figure out the concentrations after dilution and then see what's happening during titration.

Wait, let me start by calculating the diluted concentration of acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 mL, and we add 20 mL of water, so the total volume is 40 mL. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution to 40 mL, the new concentration is moles divided by the new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025, right. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, we can find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me compute the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.04 L (40 mL) × 0.025 M = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001, since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O).

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added, right? Because 10 mL is the total needed for equivalence, so 2.5 mL is 25%.

So, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Let me think about how to approach this.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, for every mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added at 25% point: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total solution volume at this point is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (2.5 mL), which is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, the pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736.

So plugging in the values: pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259. So approximately 4.26. That's one of the options.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the ratio or the logs.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact values would be better. Let me see:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075; moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL. So concentrations:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So their ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 1/3 approximately. Log(1/3) is -0.477. So yes, pH is about 4.736 - 0.477 = about 4.259 → 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, D is 4.57 and 6.92. Wait, other options may not match. So at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26.

But wait, the first part of the options is the 25% value, and the second part is equivalence. So let's check what happens at equivalence.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be calculated. Let's see: The moles of acetate will be 0.001 moles (since all the CH3COOH has been neutralized). The total volume is initial volume (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (10 mL) → 50 mL or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases: [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514 → around 8.51.

Wait, but wait! I must have made a mistake here because this doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. That's close to what I have here: 4.26 and 8.51, which would match option A.

But wait, another thought: did I consider the dilution correctly for the equivalence point?

Wait, no. Because when you add 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to the 40 mL solution, the total volume is 50 mL. The moles of acetate are 0.001, correct. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, Kb is correct, 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. So the calculation for [OH-] seems right. So pH is about 8.51.

But looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, which would fit. But wait, I thought at equivalence, the pH is around 8.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.736.

Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So yes, correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the exact expression without approximation.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Let x be [OH^-]. Then,

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be very small. So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.486 → pH = 8.514.

So that's about 8.51, which rounds to 8.51, but option A has 8.52. Close enough. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you mix the NaOH with the diluted acetic acid, is the solution volume correct?

Yes, 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Hmm, but wait. Let me think about the initial setup again. Original acetic acid is 20 mL of 0.05 M. Diluted with 20 mL H2O makes 40 mL of 0.025 M. Then adding 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH (which is 0.001 moles of NaOH) to neutralize all the acetic acid.

So the acetate concentration is correct.

But wait, another thought: why is the equivalence point pH so high? Because the acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so the solution is basic.

So, according to this, the equivalence pH is about 8.51, which is option A's second value, 8.52. So option A would have pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D: 4.57;6.92

So our calculations match option A.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me think about the 25% titration again. Did I compute the concentrations correctly?

At 25% titration, we added 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

So, initial moles of acetic acid (after dilution) is 0.001. Moles reacted: 0.00025. So moles remaining: 0.00075. Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations: CH3COOH = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. Acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4, divided by 0.0425 is 0.017647 M.

0.00025 is 2.5e-4, divided by 0.0425 is 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) → pKa is ~4.736, log(0.333) is -0.477.

So pH is 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259 → approximately 4.26.

Which matches option A's first value.

But wait another thing: did I mix up the 25% titration point correctly? Because sometimes, the percentage refers to the volume of titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL, which is correct.

So yes, the 25% is 2.5 mL added.

So, the correct values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but another option is D: 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, why would that be? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So, the concentration is 0.02 M acetate.

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O → CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], which is small, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02. So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514.

So about 8.51, which is close to 8.52 (option A).

But wait, option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is around neutral. That doesn't make sense because acetate is a base, so pH should be above 7.

But then why would the equivalence pH be 6.92? That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should have considered that the solution is not just acetate. Wait no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized to acetate.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 ≈ 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, then why is option D's equivalence pH at 6.92? That's way below 7, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the thought process.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about a strong base but a weak base? No, NaOH is a strong base. So the equivalence point should be in the basic region.

So, option A's equivalence pH of 8.52 seems correct. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking back, I see that option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the 25% titration. Let me recheck that.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution are 0.001. Moles that react: 0.00025. So CH3COOH left is 0.00075, acetate formed is 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 mL. [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425= 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.736 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → 4.736 + log(0.333) → log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH=4.736 -0.477=4.259 → ~4.26.

Yes, that's correct.

So the only option that has 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, only option A and D are possible. Because option A's equivalence is 8.52, which aligns with our calculation, and 25% is 4.26.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by calculating the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains only the conjugate base (acetate ions, CH₃COO⁻). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH₃COO⁻} = \frac{\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH⁻}]} = -\log{(3.288 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 \approx 8.52.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 mL) has been added, which is 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]}\\right)},
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.736 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log{\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right)} = 4.736 + \log{(0.333)} \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
