Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity is spherical too, with radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, s is less than R because the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when there's a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the conductor must somehow respond.

Wait, I think when a charge is placed inside a conducting shell, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to the placed charge. And the outer surface remains neutral if the conductor was initially neutral. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, its charges will rearrange. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface remains neutral because the total conductor's charge is zero.

But wait, this conductor isn't a shell. It's a solid sphere with a cavity. So how does that work? Oh right, the conductor being a solid sphere with a cavity, the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. Since the conductor is a conductor, the charges will move until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So any excess charge would be on the surface, but in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would then have +q, because the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. Wait no, wait—if the conductor was initially neutral, and we place +q inside the cavity, then the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface would have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero minus the inner charge plus the outer? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's initial charge was zero. So when you have a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have -q, which induces +q on the outer surface to maintain the conductor's neutrality. Because the conductor's charge is zero before, and the cavity's charge is +q, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer +q so that the total is zero. Wait, no: the conductor's total charge remains zero because it was initially uncharged. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, so that the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

Wait, no. Wait: When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conducting shell, the inner surface of the shell induces an opposite charge, and the outer surface remains neutral. Because the shell itself is neutral. So in this case, the conductor is the shell, so the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have zero net charge, because the conductor's overall charge is zero. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, the conductor (the spherical conductor) is uncharged. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have a charge -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, the only way the conductor's total charge is zero is if the outer surface is +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's charge is zero. So the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must add up to zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q, since (-q) + (+q) = 0. Yes, that makes sense.

So, at any point outside the conductor (radius R), the electric field is due to the charge on the outer surface. Because the electric field inside the conductor (the material between R - something and R) is zero. Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, right? Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor's total is zero, so the outer is +q.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. The charge +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q. The conductor's outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But wait, would the outer surface have +q? Because the conductor's material is neutral, but the cavity is inside, so the charges rearrange. So when you have a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor becomes -q and the outer surface becomes +q. So the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the charges are on the inner and outer surfaces.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor at point P, which is outside the conductor (so beyond R), the electric field would be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at the center. So it's like a point charge of +q at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface has a charge of +q, and the field outside the conductor is due to this charge.

Wait, but wait. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that: B) E = 1/(4 π ε₀) * q/L².

But wait, I thought that the outer surface's charge is +q. So the field outside should be due to that +q. But wait, in that case, yes. So why would any other option be correct?

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, but the conductor's outer surface is +q. So when you are outside the conductor, the field is as if the +q is at the center of the sphere.

Wait, but wait a minute. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but its distance to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between s (the distance between the centers) and l is theta.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The conductor is a sphere of radius R, with a cavity of radius r. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So s is probably small compared to R, but it doesn't matter. When you place the charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface (cavity's walls) will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q.

Now, when you consider a point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charges on the outer surface. Because the inner surface's charges are inside the conductor, their effects won't influence the outside.

But the outer surface has a charge of +q, and it's distributed as a spherical shell, so the field outside is as if the charge were at the center. So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, wait. Point P is outside the conductor, so L > R. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. How does that come into play?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the conductor's inner surface charge is -q, but because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution isn't symmetric. So does that affect the field outside the conductor?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner surface's distribution. Wait, but the outer surface's charge distribution is influenced by the cavity's position. Because the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. So the outer surface's charge distribution could be non-uniform as well.

Wait, but wait. The outer surface's charge distribution must be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the conductor's material must have zero net electric field. The total charge on the outer surface is +q, but how is it distributed?

Ah, but wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner surface's charge distribution and the geometry.

But, wait, the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius R. So regardless of where the cavity is inside, the outer surface's charge distribution adjusts to make sure that the field inside the conductor is zero. However, the presence of the inner charge (the +q in the cavity) induces a charge of -q on the inner surface, which is not centered. So the outer surface's charge must compensate for that.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge distribution is such that it makes the external field only depend on the total charge, as if it were a point charge at the center. Because from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center. So maybe the position of the cavity doesn't affect the field outside.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. If the cavity is off-center, and the inner surface's charge is -q, but the outer surface's charge is +q, does the field outside still look like a point charge at the center?

Hmm, I think so. Because the conductor's shape ensures that the external field behaves as if all the charge is at the center. So the fact that the cavity is off-center doesn't affect the external field. The electric field outside a conductor only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of where the inner charges are.

So, when you are outside the conductor, the electric field should be as if you have a point charge of +q at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B matches that.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option A is (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like it's considering the distance from the charge's position, but if the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center, perhaps the field is calculated based on l instead of L.

Wait, but no. Because the conductor's outer charge is +q, and the field outside is as if that charge is at the center. So the position of the cavity's center (s) doesn't affect the external field. So the point P's distance from the conductor's center (L) is what matters, not the distance to the cavity's center (l).

Wait, but if L is the distance from the conductor's center, and the charge is at the conductor's center, then the field is 1/(4πε₀) q/(L²). So option B.

But wait, why are there options involving l and theta? The problem seems to suggest that the position of the point P relative to the cavity's center matters, but perhaps it doesn't, because the conductor's field outside depends only on its own outer charge.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the method of images or induced charges.

Wait, another approach: the conductor is uncharged. When we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity walls) must have a charge of -q. The conductor's outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor is due to all the charges inside the Gaussian surface, which includes the conductor. But because the conductor's material is a conductor, the electric field within the conductor is zero. So for any Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge is the total charge on the conductor, which is +q (from the outer surface).

Wait, but the conductor's total charge is zero, right? Because the inner surface has -q and the outer +q, so 0. Oh wait, no. No, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

So, the Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose the +q charge. Therefore, the electric field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

So, that would be option B.

But wait, the problem says the point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. So why would any other option be correct?

Looking back, the other options involve l and theta, which is the distance from P to the cavity's center and the angle between l and s. But if the field outside depends only on the conductor's charge, which is +q at the center, then L is the distance to consider.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$, the conductor's inner surface (the walls of the cavity) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The conductor's outer surface, being neutral overall, must then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

For a point $P$ outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor), the electric field is determined by the charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is $+q$. Since the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The other options are incorrect because they involve the distance $l$ (distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity) and the angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity). However, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the conductor's outer surface and the distance $L$ from $P$ to the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity inside the conductor does not affect the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
