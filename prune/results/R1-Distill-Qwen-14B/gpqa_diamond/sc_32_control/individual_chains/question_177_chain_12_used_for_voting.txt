Okay, I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger for Star_1. 

Then, the question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, where T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if their temperatures were different, their lambda_max would differ. So, T1 = T2.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But for luminosity, I think it's more about the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are the same when measured, maybe the observed wavelengths have already factored that in. So the actual emitted wavelengths (before any Doppler shift) would be different? But the problem says the brightest wavelengths are the same, so perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of their temperatures. Or maybe since the velocities are given, they could affect the observed luminosity because of the Doppler effect? Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think.

But the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body radiation formula. So, I think the Doppler effect isn't directly affecting the calculation of luminosity here. Because the luminosity is an intrinsic property, not the observed flux. Wait, but the observed flux would depend on the Doppler shift, but the problem says they're calculating the luminosity, which is the intrinsic brightness. So perhaps the radial velocities don't directly come into play in calculating the luminosity ratio. Unless... wait, the spectral data used to find the luminosity might be affected by the Doppler shift. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me see.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak emission) are the same. So, considering the Doppler effect, if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So if one is moving away (positive radial velocity) and the other isn't moving, how does that affect the actual emitted wavelength?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So:

Wien's Law: lambda_emit = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But when a star is moving relative to us, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more precise. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximated as lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving away, v is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). If moving towards, v is negative, so observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift).

In this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its observed lambda_1 = lambda_emit_1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, so lambda_2_obs = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c). The problem says the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So:

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)

Wait, no, the observed lambdas are the same. So lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

But since Star_1 is not moving, lambda_1_obs = lambda_emit_1. Star_2 is moving away, so lambda_2_obs = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + (v_r2)/c).

So setting them equal:

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + (v_r2)/c )

But from earlier, since the peak wavelengths are the same when observed, but their emitted lambdas could be different. Oh, wait no, because the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So, in reality, their emitted lambdas might be different, but because of Doppler effects, the observed lambdas are same.

Wait, but how does that affect the calculation of their temperatures?

The astronomers determine the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. So, for each star, they observe the lambda_max, which is the same, let's say lambda_obs. So, for Star_1: lambda_1_obs = lambda_emit_1. For Star_2: lambda_2_obs = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c). So, if their observed lambda_max are same, then lambda_emit_1 and lambda_emit_2 are different.

But according to Wien's law, lambda_emit is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda_emit = 2.898e-3 m·K / T.

So, for Star_1: lambda_emit_1 = 2.898e-3 / T1.

For Star_2: lambda_emit_2 = 2.898e-3 / T2.

But from the observed lambda_max being same:

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

(2.898e-3 / T1 ) = (2.898e-3 / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel out 2.898e-3:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2 ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but that would imply that Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1. Because (1 + v_r2/c ) is greater than 1, assuming v_r2 is positive. But wait, wait. Wait, v_r is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. So as per the Doppler effect, its emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed. Because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the emitted wavelength must be shorter.

Wait, perhaps I got the equation wrong. Let me think again. The Doppler effect: if a star is moving away, the wavelengths are stretched (redshifted). So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is longer than the emitted wavelength lambda_emit. The formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. So, in that case, lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r/c )

So, for Star_1: lambda_emit_1 = lambda_obs.

Star_2: lambda_emit_2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, from Wien's law:

lambda_emit = b / T.

So,

lambda_emit_1 = b / T1 → T1 = b / lambda_emit_1 = b / lambda_obs.

lambda_emit_2 = b / T2 → T2 = b / lambda_emit_2 = b / (lambda_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )) ) = (b * (1 + v_r2/c )) ) / lambda_obs = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v_r2/c ). Because v_r2 is positive (moving away), so (1 + v_r2/c ) is greater than 1.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. But according to the Doppler effect, the star moving away must have a shorter emitted wavelength, implying a higher temperature. Because a higher temperature would emit shorter wavelengths, but when it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So yeah, the emitted wavelength is shorter, so higher temperature.

So, in this problem, Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1.

Wait, but this seems a bit tricky. Let me note down the values.

v_r2 = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So, 700 / (3e5) is about 0.002333...

So, (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, a small increase in temperature for Star_2 compared to Star_1.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Given that Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.

Wait, no: the problem says Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait, no, wait: the problem states, "Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2." So, R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, the radius ratio is R1/R2 = 1.5.

The temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1 / (1.002333) ≈ 0.997667.

Because T2 = T1 * 1.002333, so T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, no: earlier conclusion was T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ).

Wait, let me get it right.

We have T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

v_r2 is 700 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333.

So, 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So, T1 is about 0.997667 times T2. So, T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is given by:

(L1)/(L2) = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2 * (1 / (1.002333)):

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T2 / 1.002333 )^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * ( T2^4 / (1.002333)^4 ) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

R2² and T2^4 cancel out.

So,

= (2.25) / (1.002333)^4

Now, compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me approximate this. Since 1.002333 is close to 1, we can use the binomial approximation for exponents.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... 

But for x = 0.002333, x² is about 5e-6. So, maybe just the first two terms would be sufficient.

n =4.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 +4*(0.002333) + 6*(0.002333)^2.

Calculate:

4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

6 * (0.002333)^2: 0.002333^2 is about 5.44e-6. 6 * 5.44e-6 ≈ 3.264e-5.

So, it's approximately 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003264 = 1.00936464.

So, approximately 1.009365.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009365.

Hmm, 1.009365 is close to 1.01.

2.25 / 1.01 is approximately 2.2277.

But more accurately, let's compute 2.25 / 1.009365.

We can write it as approximately:

1.009365 ≈ 1 + 0.009365.

So, 1 / (1.009365) ≈ 1 - 0.009365 + (0.009365)^2 - ... 

But since 0.009365 is small, 1 / 1.009365 ≈ 0.9907 (since 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x).

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Calculating 2.25 * 0.9907:

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 0.247675.

Adding them: 1.9814 + 0.247675 ≈ 2.229075.

So, approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, option A is ~2.25.

Wait, the calculation gives about 2.23, which is option D. But wait, let's double-check our earlier steps in case I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: compute (1.002333)^4 exactly.

Let me compute 1.002333 squared first.

1.002333^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

=1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

≈1.00467144.

Then, 1.00467144 squared.

Wait, (1.00467144)^2 = ?

Using the same approach:

(1 + 0.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

=1 + 0.00934288 + (approx 0.00002182).

≈1.0093647.

So, (1.002333)^4 = approximately 1.0093647.

So, 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.229.

So, about 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

But wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of this value. So the factor is 2.23, so the luminosity is about 2.23 times higher.

But wait, the question says "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

Which is exactly what L1/L2 is. So the factor is ~2.23, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2=1.5. So in the luminosity calculation, R1 is bigger. But T1 is lower than T2, so T^4 would play a big role.

Wait, let me recompute the ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * (T1)^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

Because R2^2 cancels out.

So, (T1 / T2 )^4 = (1 / (1.002333) )^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4.

Wait, wait, no: previously, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.997667^4: let me compute this.

It's easier to compute (1 - x)^4, where x is 0.002333.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4.

x=0.002333.

x^2= (0.002333)^2 ≈ 5.44e-6.

x^3≈ 1.27e-8.

x^4≈ 2.96e-11.

So,

1 -4x = 1 -4(0.002333)= 1- 0.009332= 0.990668.

+6x² ≈ 6*(5.44e-6)= 3.264e-5 → 0.990668 + 0.00003264= 0.990699.

-4x^3 ≈ -4*(1.27e-8)= -5.08e-9 → which is negligible.

+x^4 ≈ 2.96e-11, also negligible.

So, approximately 0.990699.

So, (T1/T2 )^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

So, 2.229, which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Temperature Ratio**: The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)) and accounting for the Doppler effect, the relationship between their emitted temperatures is:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \right),
   \]
   where \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) is the radial velocity of Star_2, and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_r / c \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667.
   \]
3. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \). The ratio of the luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.997667 \), we compute:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 \cdot (T_1 / T_2)^4}{1}.
   \]
   First, calculate \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \):
   \[
   (T_1 / T_2)^4 = (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907.
   \]
   Then, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Combining these:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**Answer: D**
