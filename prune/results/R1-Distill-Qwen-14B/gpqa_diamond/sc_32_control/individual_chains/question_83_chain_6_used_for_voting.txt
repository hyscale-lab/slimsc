Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that I'm diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, I titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. 

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms acetate ions and water. The pH changes depending on how much base has been added. 

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. 

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then I add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be volume (L) multiplied by molarity. Let's calculate that. 

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. Moles of acetic acid = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is moles divided by volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. 

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. 

Let me think about the 25% titration first. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. 

Wait, but wait. How much moles of acetic acid are there initially? Oh right, it's 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. 

Since NaOH has a 1:1 mole ratio with acetic acid (because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed at 25% is also 0.00025. 

But wait, alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of volumes. The initial volume is 40 cm³. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So the amount of NaOH added at 25% would be 25% of the total needed to reach equivalence. 

Wait, maybe it's better to find the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH at equivalence = moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. 

The volume of NaOH needed for equivalence would be moles / concentration. That's 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

So 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Now, back to the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. Let's model the solution. 

The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, 0.00025 moles react, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid unreacted, and creating 0.00025 moles of acetate. 

So the situation is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. 

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 

First, I need pKa. The Ka given is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me approximate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa ≈4.733.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1.85 is 1.85. Log(2) is 0.301, so 1.85 is a bit less than that. Let me compute log(1.85) as approximately 0.267. So yes, pKa is about 4.733.

Now, [A-] is the concentration of acetate, which is 0.00025 moles, and [HA] is 0.00075 moles. But wait, the total volume is the original 40 cm³ plus the added NaOH volume. No, wait, when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³.

So [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L. Similarly, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L. 

Wait, but when I take the ratio [A-]/[HA], the denominators (same volume) will cancel out. So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. 

So pH= pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256. So approximately 4.26. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So the first pH is about 4.26. 

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. 

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. 

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water: A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. 

The concentration of acetate is the moles of acetate divided by the total volume of solution. 

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid was neutralized). 

Total volume at equivalence is the initial 40 cm³ plus the NaOH volume (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. 

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

To find the pH, I can calculate the Kb of acetate. Since Kw = 1e-14, and Ka * Kb = Kw. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10. 

But wait, wait. Let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10. 

The hydrolysis reaction is A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. 

The expression is Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]. 

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH- produced. 

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be very small. 

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11. 

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. 

So [OH-] =1.04e-5 M. 

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98. Because log(1e-5)=5, and since 1.04 is close to 1, the log is about 4.98. 

pH=14 -pOH =14-4.98=9.02. 

Wait, but wait. None of the options seem to have a pH close to 9.02. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.

Ah, wait, the initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so x² ≈5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11. 

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5)= about 4.98, so pH is 9.02. 

Looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option B:3.17;6.73 

Option C:4.73;7.00 

Option D:4.57;6.92 

Hmm. None of these have a pH around 9, which suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the equivalence point. Let me think again. 

Wait, wait, another approach. Maybe at the equivalence point, the solution isn't just the conjugate base, but perhaps I have to consider the dilution. 

Wait, no, because all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions, and the acetate comes from a strong base, so the solution is indeed basic. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate it. 

Ka=1.85e-5, so Kb= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈0.54054e-9 =5.4054e-10. That's correct.

Then, the Kb expression is x^2 / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10. 

Hmm, perhaps I should not approximate and solve for x more accurately. 

Let me write the equation as x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 -x) 

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x 

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0 

This is a quadratic equation. Let's write it as x² + (5.405e-10) x - (1.081e-11)=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). 

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1* (1.081e-11) 

(5.405e-10)^2 = (approx 2.92e-19)

4ac=4 * 1 * (-1.081e-11) → no, wait, 4ac is 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → but in the equation, c is negative, so 4ac is -4*1.081e-11. So in the discriminant, it's +4*1.081e-11?

Wait, no, because in the quadratic equation, the equation is ax² +bx +c=0, so in our case, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 * 1 * (1.081e-11) 

Compute each term: 

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 → approx 29.21e-20 = 2.921e-19. 

4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11. 

So D= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.3e-11).

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6. 

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2) 

Only the positive root makes sense. So x≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 + (-6) = -5.483.

So pOH=5.483, pH=14-5.483=8.517. Approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52.

Wait, looking back at option A, the equivalence point pH is 8.52, and 25% is 4.26. So option A would have 4.26 and 8.52. 

But earlier, when I thought about the equivalence point, my first calculation gave pH around 9, but when I solved the quadratic, I got about 8.52. So where did I go wrong before?

Ah, I think I forgot that the solution volume at equivalence is larger. Let me recount. 

At equivalence, the volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M, which I had correct.

Wait, so why is the pH about 8.52 and not higher? Because the Kb is small, so the solution is only slightly basic, but I thought with 0.02 M acetate, maybe it's more basic. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Oh wait, no, Kb is correct. 1.85e-5 → Kb=5.4e-10, which is correct.

Wait, but let's recalculate the pH with the correct x value. So [OH-]=3.288e-6.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so log(3.288e-6)=0.517-6= -5.483 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

So yes, about 8.52. 

So looking back, the 25% titration pH is about 4.26, and equivalence point is 8.52. That's option A. 

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would have equivalence point around 9. So why the discrepancy? Oh wait, perhaps I made an error in thinking that the initial assumption that x is negligible is incorrect. But in reality, solving the quadratic gives a more accurate x, which is about 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation was okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial 25% calculation. Let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added is 0.00025. So moles of acetic acid left is 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075. Moles of acetate is 0.00025. 

Volume is 40+2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075/0.0425= 0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH= pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa=4.733.

[A-]/[HA] =0.005882 /0.017647 ≈0.3333.

log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is about 4.26. 

So that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the equivalence point would be higher, but perhaps I was wrong. Let's think again. The acetate is 0.02 M and Kb is 5.4e-10. The solution is indeed not strongly basic because Kb is small. So a pH around 8.5 makes sense.

So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{moles} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]
and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{A}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \([OH^-] = x\), we solve:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, a more precise calculation using the quadratic equation for \(x\) gives:

\[
[OH^-] \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.483, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
