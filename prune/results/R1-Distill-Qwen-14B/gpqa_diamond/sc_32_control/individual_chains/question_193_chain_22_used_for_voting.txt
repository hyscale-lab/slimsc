Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula would be something like Number of stars ∝ 1/(plx^5). I remember that parallax is related to distance; specifically, parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance. Wait, no, wait a second. Oh right, parallax (pl) is equal to 1 divided by distance (d), where distance is in parsecs. So pl = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax.

So the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me think about the relationship they've given. Number of stars N is proportional to 1 over plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that would make 1/(plx^5) equal to (d)^5. Because if plx = 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5, and 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Hmm, so that's the rate of change of N with respect to distance. So we might be looking for dN/dr, the derivative. But wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5) where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance per unit range. So maybe it's the derivative. Let's compute dN/dr.

dN/dr = d/dr (k d^5) = 5k d^4. So the change in number of stars with distance is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4. Wait, the options list how the number changes with distance (per unit range). Wait, actually, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the question is about how N varies with r, perhaps as a function. Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. But the question is about per unit distance. Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me check.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars varying with parallax as 1/(plx^5). So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, that becomes N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. So as you go farther away, you have more stars in that region. But why? Because the density is higher? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a region might depend on the volume. But wait, the relation given is N ∝ 1/(plx^5), which, with plx = 1/d, becomes N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let's think about it in terms of volume. The volume of a sphere increases with r^3. So if the density of stars is uniform, the number of stars should increase with r^3. But here, the number is increasing as r^5, which is faster than r^3. So that suggests that the density isn't uniform; perhaps it's increasing with distance.

Alternatively, maybe the relation is not about the number per unit volume, but per unit distance. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at a distance r. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the density. Hmm, but that's for a volume with varying density.

Wait, let's think: the number of stars in a small range dr around distance r would be dN = N(r) - N(r + dr). But perhaps more accurately, if N is the total number up to a certain distance, then the number in a thin shell dr is dN = (d/dr) N(r) * dr. So the change per unit distance is dN/dr.

Earlier, we found that dN/dr is proportional to d^4. But the options don't have d^4. The options are A) ~r^3, B) ~r^5, C) ~r^4, D) ~r^2.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if the number of stars in a region increases as d^5, then the rate of change (dN/dr) would be 5 d^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

But wait, let me make sure. The number of stars is given as varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx^5) = k d^5.

So the number of stars in the region goes up as d^5, which is the fifth power. If you're looking at how N changes with d (the derivative), it's 5k d^4. So per unit distance, the change is proportional to d^4. So the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we compute the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \sim r^3 \)**  
**B) \( \sim r^5 \)**  
**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**  
**D) \( \sim r^2 \)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
