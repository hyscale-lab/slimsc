Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space we're dealing with is two-dimensional, probably a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere or a pseudosphere.

The question asks about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, how does that relate to the metric?

Let me think about metrics and curvature. In two dimensions, the metric tells us about the geometry. If it's a metric of a sphere, the curvature would be positive, but for a pseudosphere, it's negative. The general form of the metric for a surface of revolution can sometimes be written in terms of coordinates, and for constant curvature, you have specific forms.

Wait, the given metric looks a bit like the metric for a sphere. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me see, if I factor out the 32, the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)). So 4 is like (2)^2, because 2 squared is 4. That might be the radius squared. So maybe this metric is for a sphere of radius 2? But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, not a regular sphere.

Wait, no. The metric I remember for a sphere is something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/R²)) or something like that. Or wait, in isothermal coordinates, maybe. Alternatively, in two dimensions, the metric for a sphere can be expressed as ds² = R² (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² + a²) or something similar, depending on the parametrization.

Wait, but in this case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is 2^2. So let me think, if x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive. But if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which would make the metric blow up. So that suggests that the radius is 2, but the area is only defined where x² + y² <4.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right! A pseudosphere has negative curvature. I'm a bit confused because the metric given seems to have a denominator that goes to zero at a finite radius, which is more like a sphere's metric. Maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the relation between the metric and the Gaussian curvature. For a metric in two dimensions, the Gaussian curvature can be derived using the formula involving the determinant of the second derivatives or something like that. But maybe there's a simpler way.

The given metric is conformally flat since it's (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a function. So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). The Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²) is given by K = -e^{-2λ} (Δλ), where Δ is the Laplacian. Alternatively, another formula might be used, but I'm not exactly sure.

Let me calculate λ here. Since the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²), which can be written as e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using another method. For a metric ds² = f(r^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is sqrt(x²+y²), then the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 r)) d/d r ( (1/f) df/dr ). Or wait, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that for a surface with metric ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/R²)), which is the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space, but wait, that's for negative curvature. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model has a metric where the curvature is negative, right?

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = (4 dr²)/( (1 - r²)^2 ) + (4 r² dθ²)/( (1 - r²)^2 ), which can be written as (4/(1 - r²)^2))(dr² + r² dθ²). So the conformal factor is 4/(1 - r²)^2. That's a metric with negative curvature.

In our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Let's see, because x² + y² = r², so denominator is 4 - r². So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²) = 8 * [4/(4 - r²)].

Wait, the denominator in the Poincaré disk model is (1 - (r^2/R^2)), where R is the radius. Let me adjust for that. If in our case, 4 - r² = 4 [1 - (r²/4)] = 4 [1 - (r/(2))^2]. So the denominator is 4 (1 - (r²/4)) =4 (1 - (r^2)/(2^2)).

So, our conformal factor is 32/(4 (1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4) = 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))].

In the Poincaré model, the conformal factor is 4/( (1 - r²/4)^2 ), right? Because in the model, the conformal factor is 4/( (1 - r²/R²)^2 ), where R is the radius (maybe 2 here). So our conformal factor is 8/(1 - r²/4), but in Poincaré, it's 4/(1 - r²/4)^2. Hmm, I might be getting something mixed up here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere. Let me think: the standard metric for a sphere of radius a in 3D is ds² = a² (dx² + dy² + dz²)/(x² + y² + z² + a²), but I might be mixing up different parametrizations. Alternatively, perhaps in isothermal coordinates, the sphere's metric can be written as ds² = (R²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²), but that's for the case when you're using a different coordinate system.

Wait, in isothermal coordinates, the metric for a sphere of radius R is ds² = (R²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²). So for R=2, it would be ds² = 4/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²). But in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 - (x² + y²). So it's not the same as the sphere's metric. Hmm, so maybe this is a different kind of surface.

Wait, let's compute the Gaussian curvature. The formula for Gaussian curvature K when the metric is conformally flat (as this is) is K = - (e^{-2λ}) (Δλ), where λ is (1/2) ln(f), with f being the conformal factor.

So f = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So λ = (1/2) ln(f) = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ].

The Laplacian of λ in 2D is Δλ = (1/r) d/dr (r dλ/dr).

Let's compute dλ/dr first.

dλ/dr = (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r) / (4 - r²) ) ) ] = (1/2) [ (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = r/(4 - r²).

So, Δλ = (1/r) d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the term inside: r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) = r²/(4 - r²).

Now, take the derivative with respect to r: d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ].

Using the quotient rule: [ (2r)(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2r (4 - r²) + 2 r^3 = 8r - 2 r^3 + 2 r^3 = 8r.

So derivative is 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, multiply by (1/r) as per the Laplacian: (1/r) * [8r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is -e^{-2λ} * Δλ.

Compute e^{-2λ}:

e^{-2λ} = e^{- [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ] } = e^{ ln( (4 - r²)/32 ) } = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - (4 - r²)/32 * [ 8/(4 - r²)^2 ) ].

Simplify: The (4 - r²) in the numerator cancels with one in the denominator, leaving (1)/(32) * 8/(4 - r²) ) * (-1).

Wait, let me compute step by step.

(4 - r²)/32 * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ] = (8) / [32 (4 - r²) ) ].

So 8/32 = 1/4.

So, 1/(4(4 - r²)).

Multiply by -1: K = - [1/(4(4 - r²))].

Wait, but wait, that's a function of r. But for a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature, K should be a constant. Hmm, but here K depends on r, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant. That's confusing because the question is about a pseudosphere.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the Gaussian curvature. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, when computing dλ/dr:

λ = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ].

So, dλ/dr = (1/2)[ 0 - ( derivative of ln(4 - r²) ) ]

Derivative of ln(4 - r²) with respect to r is ( -2r ) / (4 - r²).

So, dλ/dr = (1/2) [ (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = r/(4 - r²). That seems correct.

Then, Δλ = (1/r) d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) ].

r * (r/(4 - r²)) = r²/(4 - r²).

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ] = [2r (4 - r²) + r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Let me compute the derivative:

d/dr [r²/(4 - r²)] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, that's the quotient rule: (numerator derivative * denominator - numerator * denominator derivative) / denominator^2.

So numerator is r², denominator is (4 - r²).

Numerator derivative: 2r.

Denominator derivative: -2r.

So,

(2r)(4 - r²) - r² (-2r) ) / (4 - r²)^2.

= [ 8r - 2 r^3 + 2 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

The -2r^3 and +2r^3 cancel, leaving 8r.

So the derivative is 8r/(4 - r^2)^2.

Then, multiply by (1/r): 8/(4 - r^2)^2.

So Δλ = 8/(4 - r^2)^2.

Then, K = -e^{-2λ} * Δλ.

e^{-2λ} is (4 - r^2)/32, as before.

So K = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ].

= - [8 (4 - r^2) ] / [32 (4 - r^2)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator.

8/32 = 1/4.

(4 - r^2) in numerator cancels with one (4 - r^2) in denominator, leaving (4 - r^2) in denominator as (4 - r^2)^1.

So K = - (1)/(4 (4 - r^2)).

Hmm, K is a function of r, which suggests that the curvature varies with position, which would imply it's not a pseudosphere but perhaps a different kind of surface. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2, which should have constant curvature.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking about the metric. Let me look again at the given metric. It's ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, if I factor out the 32, that's 32 = 2^5. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the metric in terms of a line element in a space with negative curvature.

Wait, another approach: the area element in the metric is given by sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2 dx² dy², but wait, in two dimensions, the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms.

Wait, the metric tensor g in matrix form is:

g_xx = 32/(4 - r²)
g_xy = 0
g_yy = 32/(4 - r²)
g_yx = 0.

So determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2.

So area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy g_yx) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero, it's sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r^2))^2 ) = 32/(4 - r^2).

So the area element is [32/(4 - r^2)] dx dy.

But to compute the area, we need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. So the domain is where 4 - r^2 > 0, i.e., r^2 <4 → r <2. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the embedding space and the surface's own geometry.

Wait, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface in 3D with constant negative curvature. But the metric given here is 2D, so perhaps it's the induced metric on a surface embedded in 3D.

Wait, but the metric provided is in 2D, so perhaps the surface is a 2D pseudosphere, which would have an area. But in 2D, a pseudosphere would have infinite area because it's a surface of constant negative curvature, like a horn torus or something.

Wait, no. Wait, a 2D surface of constant negative curvature is unbounded and has infinite area. For instance, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So if the metric given corresponds to a surface with negative curvature, the area might be infinite.

Wait, but let's think again. The given metric is in polar coordinates (x and y, but perhaps I should think in terms of r and θ). So the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ.

Wait, so the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r^2)] r dr dθ.

Let me compute that integral.

First, the integral over θ is straightforward: it's 2π.

So area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r]/(4 - r^2) dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r]/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr]/(u) = ∫ [32 (-du/2)] / u = (-16) ∫ (1/u) du.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0:

∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = (-16) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

= (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes (-16) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] = (-16)(-infty) → positive infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2 → ∫ [32 r dr]/(u) from u=4 to u=0.

With substitution, it becomes (-16) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16) ( -infty - ln(4) ) → (-16)(-infty) → positive infinity.

So the area integral diverges to infinity. Which suggests that the area is infinite.

But wait, the problem says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So if the area is infinite, then the answer would be option D, which is +infty.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer would be D.

But why is the area infinite? Because in a surface of constant negative curvature (like a pseudosphere), the total area is indeed infinite. So the pseudosphere's metric, when integrated, gives infinite area.

So the answer should be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its total area is known to be infinite due to its unbounded nature.

To compute the area, the area element for the given metric is derived as:

\[
\text{Area element} = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). The total area is then obtained by integrating this area element over the domain where the metric is defined, which corresponds to \( r < 2 \) (since the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) must remain positive). In polar coordinates, the area element becomes:

\[
\text{Area element} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \left[-\infty - \ln(4)\right] = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the total area diverges to infinity. This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature and infinite total area.

The correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.
