Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to visualize it. So, the structure has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means there's a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde) somewhere. Wait, maybe the ring also has a carbonyl group as the carbaldehyde part? So the molecule is something like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a CH group attached to OH and cyclohexyl, and another ring with a formyl group (CHO)?

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with C≡CH.

I need to figure out the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let me think about the possible transformations.

So, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. One common reaction for terminal alkynes is deprotonation to form an acetylide. Maybe the first step is using a strong base like NaNH2, which is a common deprotonating agent for alkynes.

Looking at the options, I see that option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, but wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl, ethyl is C2H5Cl. I'm not sure yet.

After forming the acetylide, what's next? Maybe a substitution reaction. The acetylide is a strong base and can act as a nucleophile. If we have a methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation. So, the acetylide (which is CH2- ) would attack methyl chloride (CH3Cl), leading to CH2CH2-? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe I'm mixing up the groups. Oh wait, the acetylide would be at the end of the triple bond. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, if you add methyl chloride, perhaps it’s an alkylation, so the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2 triple bond, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, wait. No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a triple bond. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-H group? No, ethynyl is specifically -C≡CH, so the cyclohexane has a substituent where the ethynyl is attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group directly attached. So, cyclohexane-C≡CH. So the molecule is cyclohexyl-ethyne, like when the triple bond is attached to the ring.

When you deprotonate that with NaNH2, you get the acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, reacting with methyl chloride would substitute the chloride. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's not possible because the triple bond can't have more than two substituents. Wait, maybe the acetylide is at the end, so the substitution would add another carbon. So from cyclohexane-C≡CH, deprotonating gives cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+, which then reacts with CH3Cl to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's a coupling reaction, like a Glaser coupling, but that usually requires Cu and O2, which I don't see in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the acetylide is used for a substitution. Wait, another approach: perhaps after forming the acetylide, a 1,2-addition of some kind happens. Or maybe the acetylide is used in a coupling reaction with another molecule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe after the alkylation, the triple bond becomes a longer chain. So from ethynylcyclohexane, after adding CH3, we get a longer alkyne. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, and then a subsequent step, like hydrogenation. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option C has NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So after the alkylation, they add hydrogen with a catalyst. So let's see: ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide → alkylated to form a longer alkyne, then hydrogenated to an alkane?

Wait, but hydrogenation of alkynes can lead to either alkenes (with H2 and Lindlar catalyst) or full hydrogenation to alkanes (with H2 and a metal like Pd, Pt, etc.). So if the alkyne is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, it becomes an alkane. So maybe the triple bond becomes a single bond.

Wait, working through the steps:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So acetylide formed, then CH3Cl adds to the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? But wait, that's not possible because the triple bond can't have three substituents. Oh, wait, perhaps the acetylide is a sodium salt of the ethynide, and methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So the acetylide (strong base) will attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, but CH3Cl is a methyl group. So after reaction, the structure would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's just adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So the molecule would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is not adding a methyl group but something else. Wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So the acetylide (which is a strong base) would react with CH3Cl in an SN2 reaction? So the CH3Cl would donate a methyl group to the acetylide's carbon, making a new single bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond? Wait, no. Let me think. The acetylide is R-C≡C^- Na^+. Reacting with CH3Cl (which is an alkyl chloride) would give R-C≡C-CH3. But that's a tetrahedral carbon, which is not possible because the triple bond can't have more than two substituents. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation is actually a substitution on the carbon adjacent to the triple bond. Oh, wait, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So when you deprotonate it with NaNH2, you get cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, adding methyl chloride — CH3Cl — would perhaps add a methyl group to the acetylide's carbon, but that would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, which is a longer alkyne. But that's possible. So after step 1, we have 1-(cyclohexyl)propyne?

Wait, but 1-propyne would be HC≡C-CH3, but in this case, the cyclohexyl is attached to the first carbon of the triple bond. So it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, perhaps the next step is hydrogenation. Looking at option C, the second step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That sounds like a full hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, making R-C-CH3 with a single bond. So after hydrogenation, we have cyclohexane-C-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because hydrogenation of a triple bond (R-C≡C-R') with H2 and a metal catalyst would add two H2 molecules, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. If the triple bond is R-C≡C-R', then hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-R'? But in this case, the triple bond is R-C≡C-H. Wait, no, the structure after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3. So after hydrogenation, it becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Because the triple bond is between C and CH3, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each carbon. So R-C≡C-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would extend the chain by two carbons, which doesn't seem right. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step is a partial hydrogenation, like using Lindlar's catalyst to get a cis double bond. But here, the catalyst is H2 with Pd, which usually leads to full hydrogenation. So after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group? Wait, no. Let me think again. The triple bond is between two carbons: the first carbon is attached to cyclohexane, and the second is attached to a methyl group. So, before hydrogenation, it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, we would add two Hs to each carbon, so each triple bond carbon becomes CH2. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that's a three-carbon chain. Wait, that would be cyclohexane with a propyl group attached, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One ring has a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the same ring has a formyl (CHO) group.

So perhaps the starting material needs to undergo several steps: alkyne deprotonation, alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, and maybe some other functional group transformations.

Wait, another approach: maybe after forming the acetylide and alkylating, we can perform a coupling reaction, but perhaps the steps involve forming a larger ring or adding functional groups.

Wait, let me think about each option and the steps they propose.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation perhaps, but more commonly for epoxide formation. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used as a strong base for elimination, such as in the formation of alkenes from alcohols via dehydration. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O — that sounds like an oxidation condition, maybe for sulfonation or for oxidizing alcohols to ketones. Or perhaps it's Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH. Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent, used for Birch reductions, but more commonly for deprotonating or reducing certain functional groups. O3/H2O is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. O3 followed by (CH3)2S is typically used in reductive workup after ozonolysis, to form aldehydes or ketones without overoxidizing. Ba(OH)2 again for elimination.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH. Methanol as a reagent after NaNH2? Maybe for some alkylation or protection, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Let's try to map the steps.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps we need to form a ketone or aldehyde group through oxidation.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

1. Deprotonate with NaNH2 to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation: maybe adding a methyl group via CH3Cl.

3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, which would give a longer chain.

But wait, after hydrogenation, if we have a longer chain, perhaps we can perform a ring-forming reaction or an oxidation.

Wait, maybe the sequence is: form the acetylide, alkylate, hydrogenate to a single bond, then form a ring via some cyclization, or perhaps introduce a functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is used for a coupling reaction to form a bicyclic structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So maybe, after some steps, a cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see any Mg reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's say after step 1 and 2 (NaNH2 and CH3Cl), we have a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated in step 3 to a single bond. Then, perhaps in step 4, some oxidation.

Wait, looking at option C, the steps are:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → alkylation, so acetylide formation followed by CH3Cl adding to make a longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond, so the alkyne becomes an alkane.

So after step 2, we have a structure with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. After alkylation with CH3Cl, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes single bond, so each carbon gains two Hs. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's just a straight chain, not a ring. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't add just H2 but perhaps another substituent. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is used to form a double bond, but I think Pd with H2 usually does full hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think about the target structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. Also, there's a formyl group (CHO) attached to the ring. So the same carbon (position 1) has both the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group and the formyl group? Or perhaps the formyl is on a different position. Wait, the name is 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the carbaldehyde is at position 1. So the main ring's position 1 has a formyl group and the substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

Wait, that can't be possible unless it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1 which is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and also a formyl group at another position, perhaps position 1 as well? That seems unlikely, so perhaps the substituent is at position 1 and the formyl is at position 1. Hmm, but that's impossible because a carbon can't have both a formyl and another substituent in such a way. So perhaps the formyl is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 2. Or perhaps the formyl is at position 1, and the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group at the same position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a spiro compound, but probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a side chain that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone or aldehyde through oxidation. So after some steps, perhaps an alcohol is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Let me try to think of each option's steps.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms the acetylide, then alkylation adds a methyl group, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a three-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane, which is now a cyclohexane with a propyl group.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But after step 2, our molecule has a single bond, so I'm not sure. Unless there's a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, maybe the hydrogenation step was a partial hydrogenation, but no, H2 and Pd usually does full hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step doesn't come first. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation step is not adding a methyl group but something else.

Wait, maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a new carbon chain which can be cleaved via ozonolysis. For example, if the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, ozonolysis would require a double bond to cleave. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has two cyclohexane rings. One ring has a formyl group and a substituent, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane can be used to form a ring through a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's more under UV light and usually with dienes, so probably not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde group, which can then undergo some kind of condensation reaction.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. So, if the triple bond is oxidized to a diketone or a ketone. But ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Oxidation of terminal alkynes (like RC≡CH) can be done under specific conditions. For example, in acidic conditions with KMnO4, it can oxidize to a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, looking at option D:

Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li in liq. NH3; then O3 and (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol as a methylating agent? But NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, then reacting with methanol. Hmm, but CH3OH is a weaker electrophile than CH3Cl, so maybe the acetylide would attack the methanol, giving a methyl group attached.

Wait, but NaNH2 would deprotonate CH3Cl easily, but CH3OH is less reactive. So, perhaps the first step is deprotonation, then alkylation with methanol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: form the acetylide, then alkylate with CH3Cl (as in option C or A), then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (as in C, third step H2/Pd), then perform ozonolysis. But wait, after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the order is different. Maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a longer chain which is then dehydrogenated to form a double bond. But that doesn't fit the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone. For example, via oxidation. But I don't see an oxidation step in the options until the later steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the acetylide is used for a coupling reaction, like a Sonogashira coupling, but that would require a palladium catalyst and a halide, which I don't see in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with a bromoarene or similar electrophilic species, but again, I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the steps are aiming to form a cyclopropane ring or some other ring structure, but I’m not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkylation adds a methyl group, leading to a longer alkyne, which upon hydrogenation becomes a longer alkane chain. Then, perhaps ozonolysis is used to cleave a double bond that's formed elsewhere, but I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at option C, after hydrogenation (step 2), step 3 is ozonolysis followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. But after step 2, the molecule would have a single bond, no double bonds. So unless step 2 stops at the double bond (partial hydrogenation), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that forms a double bond, which is then cleaved in step 3.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. So, for example, using Lindlar's catalyst (H2, catalyst poisoned with quinoline) would give the cis addition. But in the options, the hydrogenation catalyst is Pd-calcium carbonate, which is usually for full hydrogenation to single bonds. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the acetylide is used to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to a trans alkene, which is then cleaved via ozonolysis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are designed to form a carbonyl group. For example, after hydrogenation, the molecule has a CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached. If there's a way to form a double bond, perhaps via elimination, then ozonolysis can cleave it.

Wait, maybe after the alkylation and hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination. For example, generating an alkene via elimination. So, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. If the molecule has an alcohol group, Ba(OH)2 could dehydrate it to form an alkene. But I'm not seeing where the alcohol comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to make an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond (but if there's no double bond, that wouldn't work).

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Let's take option C: steps are 1. NaNH2, CH3Cl; 2. H2/Pd; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

After step 1: acetylide + CH3Cl → longer alkyne.

After step 2: triple bond becomes single → longer alkane.

After step 3: ozonolysis requires a double bond, which isn't present. So this might not make sense.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Not sure about the first step. Maybe the NaNH2 and methanol could form a methyl ether, but not clear.

Option B: steps 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonating or for Birch reductions. After alkylation with ethyl chloride, perhaps the acetylide is made and then ethylated, leading to a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which might perform a deprotonation or elimination. Then, ozonolysis to cleave a double bond.

Hmm, but after alkylation, the molecule would have a longer alkyne. Then, step 2: Li in NH3 could perhaps induce elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So let's map this:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2, then alkylation with ethyl chloride → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps elimination of a proton to form a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3 → cyclohexane-C=CH-CH2CH3? But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, leading to a double bond. So after step 2, we have a cyclohexane ring with a double bond and an ethyl group.

Then, ozonolysis (step 3) would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene is in the middle, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, each attached to the cyclohexane.

But wait, the target molecule has only one formyl group, so perhaps that would be the case.

But I'm not sure, and this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible reagents.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde. So looking for oxidation steps in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A has H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O, which is a strong oxidizing condition (Jones oxidation), which would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

Option C has Ba(OH)2, which is a base and may cause elimination.

Option D has NH4OH after ozonolysis, which is a mild acid workup.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct sequence involves introducing an alcohol group, then oxidizing it to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: alkyne → alkylation → hydrogenation → oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via oxidation.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved, but I don't see any Mg reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is formed via a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes some kind of cyclopropanation, but that's not indicated in the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is formed via a conjugate addition or another nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a ketone, then performing a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction to form a CH2 group.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. I think I need to try to map each option's steps and see which leads to the target molecule.

Let's take option C again:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → acetylide formation, then methyl group addition → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But this molecule is a straight chain with no double bonds. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps this sequence isn't correct.

Option D: steps include NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for a different alkylation. Let's see.

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol, leading to OMe group? Not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Reacting with methanol might abstract a proton, but perhaps it's used for deprotonation and then alkylation with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, then quenching with methanol to form some ether. Not sure.

Then, step 2 is Li in liq. NH3. This could be for Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but I don't see any aromatics here. Alternatively, it could be for deprotonating something else.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So perhaps the molecule now has a double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not seeing how the steps lead to the target.

Option B: steps 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes.

So, let's see:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond? Or maybe the molecule becomes cyclohexane-C=CH-CH2CH3.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So the molecule would split into two parts. But the target molecule is a single molecule, so perhaps this isn't the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring formation. But I'm not sure.

Option A: steps include Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 etc.

After step 1: alkylation with CH3Cl → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenation to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond. So Ba(OH)2 could dehydrate an alcohol to form an alkene. So perhaps before this step, there's an alcohol group introduced.

Wait, but how would the alcohol group be introduced? Maybe in an earlier step.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is treated with Ba(OH)2 to form an epoxide? But Ba(OH)2 is more commonly used for elimination.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to think about the target molecule's structure again. It has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a carbonyl group and an alcohol group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a carbonyl group, then undergoes some additions.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde. For example, via oxidation. But I'm not seeing an oxidation step in the early steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via a hydrocyanation followed by hydrolysis, but that's not indicated in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Grignard-like reaction to form a ketone.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, perhaps leading to a chain that can undergo elimination.

4. Use Ba(OH)2 to eliminate and form a double bond.

5. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

6. Workup to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form acetylide and alkylate.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis, but without a double bond, it doesn't do anything. So that's a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation is not on the triple bond, but on the cyclohexane ring. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the acetylide is treated with another acetylide to form a larger ring. But that requires coupling reagents which I don't see in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with a bromide to form a longer chain.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The target has a formyl group, so one of the steps must be an oxidation to form an aldehyde or ketone. Looking at the options, only option A and C have possible oxidation steps. Option A has H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is Jones oxidation, and option C has Ba(OH)2, which isn't an oxidizing agent but a base.

Option D has NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Wait, the target's aldehyde group could come from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps in the steps, an alcohol is formed, then oxidized.

Looking at the options, which have steps that could introduce an alcohol and then oxidize it.

Option C: after ozonolysis, which would form carbonyl groups, perhaps. Then Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Acetylide formation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup with Ba(OH)2 to form an alcohol.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C: NaNH2, CH3Cl → alkylation; H2/Pd → hydrogenation; O3/(CH3)2S → cleavage; Ba(OH)2 → elimination or something else.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the clear path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the steps involve forming the acetylide, alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and then Ba(OH)2 for elimination or another step that forms the necessary functional groups.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one because it involves ozonolysis and workup.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is the right choice because it includes ozonolysis and Li in NH3 for elimination.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the process of elimination and the possible steps, I think option C is the correct one. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne (-C≡CH) group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide of ethynylcyclohexane and alkylates it with CH₃Cl, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or dehydration.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or secondary alcohols to ketones.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the target molecule's specific functional groups (formyl and hydroxymethyl) are formed.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with C₂H₅Cl, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong reducing agent, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid workup, typically used after ozonolysis to form aldehydes or ketones.

This sequence involves ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. However, the steps do not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with CH₃Cl, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, with (CH₃)₂S as a reductive workup.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or dehydration.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the double bond required for ozonolysis is formed after hydrogenation, making it inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Forms the acetylide and possibly introduces a methyl group via methanol.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong reducing agent, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid workup, typically used after ozonolysis to form aldehydes or ketones.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group are introduced, and the role of methanol in the first step is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences fully align with the target molecule's structure. However, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially lead to the formation of the required functional groups, even though the exact pathway is unclear. The sequence includes acetylide formation, alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, which are reasonable steps for introducing carbonyl groups.
