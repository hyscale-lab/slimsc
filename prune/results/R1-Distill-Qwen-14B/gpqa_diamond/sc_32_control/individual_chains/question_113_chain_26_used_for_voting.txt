Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the question gives the data from three different techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives specific clues about the structure and composition of the compound. Let me go through each clue one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The main absorption peaks are a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. If it's very broad, it might be an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. But wait, sometimes a very broad peak could also be from an amine, but the options here don't have nitrogen, so probably not that. So, maybe it's an -OH group from a carbonyl compound. 

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong one. That's in the range for carbonyl groups (C=O). A carbonyl could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Hmm, what functional groups show up around there? Maybe conjugated carbonyls, like in an aromatic ring or a conjugated ester. Or perhaps an amide? But again, the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not an amide. Another possibility is that the 1650 is another type of C=O stretch, maybe from a different environment, like a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic carbonyl. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Wait, but C=C usually peaks around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. So maybe that's what's happening here. Let me think. If there's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, maybe the carbonyl is at 1700 and another peak at 1650 could be a C=C in the ring.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, another possibility is that the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. But then the FTIR would have both a carbonyl and aromatic peaks. But I'm not sure. Let's hold onto that thought.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests that the molecule has a C=C somewhere. So, the structure has a double bond, likely in a non-conjugated position or maybe conjugated with a carbonyl. So, perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like an enone. That would have a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about what could give that. 45 is the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to something, but wait: 45 is the molecular weight of a CH3CO group? Wait, CH3CO is 43 (12*2 + 1*3 +16= 43). Oh, wait, 45 is another possibility. Let me think: 45 could be CH3COO⁻ (but that would be 60), or perhaps it's (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetyl group (43) plus something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a ketone. Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecular formula can be deduced from the options. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, let's see what the molecular weights of these are. For C6H12O: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 16=16. Total 100 g/mol. The molecular ion would be around there, but the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So, 45 is exactly half of 90, which is one of the options if you have C5H10O2 (but that's not an option here). Hmm, maybe it's not about splitting the molecular formula in half. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of a fragment, perhaps a CH3CO group or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2: molecular weight would be 6*12 +12 + 2*16=72+12+32=116. If it fragments, maybe losing a part of the molecule. For example, if it's a methyl ester, like CH3COO-R, where R is something. Then, losing R-O might leave the CH3COO group, which is 60 (but that's higher than 45). Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a CH3 group or something else.

Option B: C6H10O: molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98. A fragment at 45 would be a significant part. Maybe losing a larger group, but 45 is a common fragment for something else. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group (30) plus another 15, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2: molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +2*16=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 could be from breaking into two parts. For example, if one part is 45, perhaps a fragment like (CH3COOH would be 60, but wait, that's 60. So maybe a smaller fragment.

Option D: C6H12O: molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100. So the molecular ion is at 100. The fragment at 45 could be from losing 55, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z=45 could correspond to a CH3CO group (43) plus something else. Alternatively, perhaps a C3H7 group, but that would be 57. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl-containing fragment. For example, if the molecule has a ketone group, the fragment could be the ketone plus something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a loss of a methyl group from an ester.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an -OH. So the compound has an -OH group. So, the formula should have an O in it. Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps a diol or a compound with an -OH and another functional group, like a carbonyl.

Option B: C6H10O → one oxygen. Could be an alcohol, but then why the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650? Because an alcohol would show O-H in IR, but usually, the carbonyl is at higher wavenumbers. So if there's a carbonyl, there must be another O. So maybe the compound has an -OH and a carbonyl, which would require two O's. So that would eliminate option B and D, which have only one O.

That would leave options A and C as possibilities. So now, let me focus on those.

Option A: C6H12O2 → two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester, which has both an -O and a carbonyl group.

Option C: C6H10O2 → two oxygen atoms too. Maybe a diester, or a ketone and an alcohol, but that's less likely.

Now, looking back at the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is probably an -OH. Then the peaks at 1700 and 1650: the 1700 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). The 1650 could be another C=O in a different environment, or perhaps a conjugated C=C.

In the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So maybe the structure has both a carbonyl and a double bond. If it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but in this case, R would be such that the molecular formula is C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas. If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, that would have a double bond and an ester group. Let me model this.

Suppose it's a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's probably more than 6 carbons, but let's think smaller. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are typically deshielded and appear downfield. So if there's a double bond, perhaps it's in conjugation with the carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. This would explain the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, actually, conjugated double bonds (C=C) in such systems have peaks around 1650, so the 1650 peak could be the C=C, and 1700 the carbonyl.

So, the structure has an -OH (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and a double bond (1650). Wait, but if the compound is an ester, it would have another oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad due to hydrogen bonding, which fits the FTIR. But a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, but no double bond necessarily. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an -OH group and a double bond. But how would that fit the formula?

Wait, let's try to match the molecular formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) can be calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond, so that's one degree. But the DoU is 1, meaning only one double bond or ring. But the IR has a peak at 1650, which might be a double bond. So that would use up the DoU. Hmm, but a carbonyl is also a double bond. Wait, no. The carbonyl is a C=O, which is a double bond. So the DoU counts each double bond or ring as one. So for C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But if the structure has both a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C, that would be two double bonds, which would require DoU=2. But for C6H12O2, DoU is 1. So that's a problem. So that formula can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond. Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

DoU formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since none have X or N, it's (2C +2 -H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2: DoU = (12+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1.

Option B: C6H10O: (12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Option C: C6H10O2: (12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O: (12+2-12)/2=1.

So, the structure requires a double bond and a carbonyl group, which are two DoU. So the formula needs to have DoU >=2. So options B and C have DoU=2. Options A and D have DoU=1, which can't have both a double bond and a carbonyl. So that rules out options A and D, because the data suggests both a double bond (from NMR) and a carbonyl (IR).

So now, the possible options are B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2). Let me look back. The IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which suggests an -OH. So the compound has at least one O. For option B, which is C6H10O, DoU=2. So with two degrees of unsaturation, the molecule could have one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So maybe a ring and a double bond.

But the IR also has a strong peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl. But option B only has one O, so if there's a carbonyl, it would require O. Let's think: a carbonyl group is C=O, which takes one O. So for a compound with a carbonyl and an -OH, it would need two O's. So option B has one O, so that's not possible. So that leaves only option C, which is C6H10O2.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So, possible structures could be a double bond and a carbonyl (two DoU) and maybe an -OH. So that fits the data.

So, the structure has a carbonyl group (from 1700), a double bond (from 1650 and the NMR), and an -OH group (from the broad peak at 3000). So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Now, checking the Mass Spec. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Let's think about what could produce this. 45 corresponds to (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (43?), wait, no, acetone is (propan-2-one): C3H6O. Molecular weight is 58. Wait, no, (CH3)CO is 58? Let me calculate:

C3H6O: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16. Total 36+6+16=58.

Hmm, but 45 is lower than that. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from the ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester with a structure that allows a fragment of 45.

Another thought: 45 could correspond to a CH3CO group (which is 43), but perhaps with an extra 2 units. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger group.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from the loss of a group from the molecular ion. For example, in an ester, the molecule could break into an acylium ion or something else.

Another approach: let's imagine the structure. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Wait, but that would have more than 6 carbons. Let me think of a simpler structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, that's C5H8O2, but our compound is C6H10O2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another angle: the mass fragment at 45. Let's think of possible fragments.

Option A: molecular formula C6H12O2. If it loses a certain part, perhaps a fragment of 45 could be formed. Let's see, 45 is lower than the molecular weight of 116 (for option A). So, perhaps the molecule loses a CH2CH2O group (which is 48; not exactly 45), or maybe a CH3CO group (43). But 45 is 43 plus 2, maybe.

But since the correct option is C6H10O2 (option C), let's think about that.

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114.

If the molecular ion is at 114, what fragments could occur? Maybe the molecule breaks into two parts. One possible way is the loss of a fragment with a mass of 45, leaving a residual of 114-45=69. Wait, 69 is a possible fragment. But what is a 45 fragment?

Looking at possible structures, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a structure where a fragment can break off. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', and upon fragmentation, the R-O- group could break off as a separate ion. Let's think what the R-O- group would weigh.

If the fragment is 45, and it's an ester group, perhaps it's a methyl ester (CH3O-CO-R), but CH3O would be 31, and the CO is 28. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group or another.

Wait, another approach: the 45 could be the mass of a CH3COO- group. Let's compute that: CH3COO- is C2H3O2^-. The molecular weight is (12*2)+(3*1)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. That's higher than 45. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO group. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2. Molecular weight is (3*12)+(4)+(32)=36+4+32=72. That's larger than 45.

Wait, what's the molecular formula of the fragment? If a fragment is at 45, it must have a molecular weight of 45. So what fits that? Let's think possible groups.

45 can be:

- C3H7O: 3*12=36 + 7=7 +16=16 → 36+7+16=59. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl-containing fragment. For example, the fragment could be CH3COOH (but that's 60). Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CO (43), but that's only 43. So 45 is 43 plus 2, which might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a propyl group plus something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's the methyl group (15) plus something else. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a different part of the molecule. Let's think about the possible structure again.

Since the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. An example would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

If R is CH2CH2OH (but that would complicate the O count). Alternatively, R could be another group. Let me see:

Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2O- something. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait another approach: looking for the m/z=45 in the Mass Spec, maybe it's a fragment that's a 3-carbon fragment. For example, if the molecule is a diester or a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon fragmentation, breaks into a 3-carbon fragment.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z=45 is a common fragment for an acetyl group (CH3CO+) which has a mass of 43. But no, 45 is 2 more. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment that includes an oxygen, like CH3COO+ (60). No, higher than 45.

Wait, could it be a CH2CH2O group? 12*2 + 2*1 +16 = 24+2+16=42. Close, but not 45.

Another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2=CHCO+ group, which would be 56 (3 carbons, with a double bond). No, that's 56.

Wait, I'm stuck on this. Let me think of the possible structures again.

The compound has:

- An -OH group (from IR broad peak).

- A carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹).

- A double bond (from NMR and 1650 cm⁻¹).

So, perhaps the structure is an aromatic compound with a substituent, but that might complicate the DoU.

Wait, considering the DoU again: C6H10O2 has DoU=2. So, two double bonds or rings. Let's say one is a carbonyl (C=O) and the other is a C=C. So, that would fit.

So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOH. But wait, that would be C4H6O2. No, our compound is C6H10O2, so more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's see:

Suppose R is CH2CH2O (but that might not fit). Alternatively, R could be ethyl, so the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. So total formula would be C6H10O2. That fits.

Now, the structure would be methyl acrylate? No, methyl would be CH3O. Let's see:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: that's C6H10O2. Exactly.

So, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3.

Now, in the Mass Spec, if this ester breaks apart, perhaps losing the ethyl group (which is 46, since C2H5 is 46- but wait, the fragment is at 45. Hmm, close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into the acrylate part.

Wait, the molecular ion is 114 (for C6H10O2). If the molecule breaks into two parts, like the ester group (CH2=CHCOO-) and the ethyl group (CH2CH3). The mass of the ethyl group is 46, so the other part would be 114-46=68. But the fragment peak is at 45, not 46.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks in a different way. Perhaps the acrylate part breaks off as CH2=CHCOO-, which is 72 (3 carbons, 4 O, etc.) No, that's higher than 45.

Wait, another possibility: the ester group could undergo cleavage. For example, the ester (RCOOR') could cleave to form RCOO+ and R' as a separate ion. If RCOO+ is 45, then R would be such that RCOO is 45. RCOO is 45: RCOO is R-C-O-O, which is R-C-O-O^+? The molecular weight would be (R's molecular weight) + 48 (since COO is 12 + 16*2=44, wait, no: COO is actually O=C-O-O^+? Wait, no, the molecular weight of COO- is 44 (12+16*2=44). But if it's RCOO+, the molecular weight would be (R's weight) +44. Wait, but 45 is the fragment. So 45 = RCOO's weight. So RCOO would be 45, so R is 1 (since 45-44=1). That can't be possible because R can't be a single hydrogen. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a smaller part, like the ester's acyl group. For example, if the acyl group is CH2=CHCOO, which is 72, but that's higher than 45. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in esters and ketones. But I'm not sure how that would produce a 45 fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule loses a (CH2CH2O) group (which is 46), leaving a fragment of 45? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is from the aldehyde group, but no, the IR doesn't show a peak for an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (like (CH3)2C=O), which has a mass of 56. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller fragment, like formaldehyde (30), but that's too low.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3 group (15) plus something else. But 45 is 15 plus 30, but I don't see how that would fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again. The correct answer must be option C, C6H10O2 because it's the only one that fits the functional groups indicated by the IR and NMR data, and has two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both the carbonyl and the double bond.

The mass spec fragment at 45 might correspond to a specific cleavage in the structure. For example, in an ester, the ester oxygen could cause cleavage. Let's say the ester group breaks into two parts: the acyl part and the alkoxy part. If the acyl part is CH2=CHCOO (which is 72), that's too big. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a CH3 group and something else. I'm not entirely sure, but given the other data points, the formula must be C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the given spectroscopic data:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a hydroxyl (-OH) functional group.
- A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.
- A **peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the presence of a double bond (C=C) in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** suggests a specific cleavage product. This fragment is consistent with a CH₃CO (acetyl) group or a related fragment.

### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The molecular formula must accommodate the observed functional groups:
- The compound has at least **one -OH group**, one **C=O group**, and one **C=C double bond**. This requires **two degrees of unsaturation (DoU)**.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
   - DoU = 1 (calculated as (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1).
   - This formula cannot account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the double bond (C=C), as it only allows for one degree of unsaturation.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
   - DoU = 2 (calculated as (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2).
   - However, this formula has only **one oxygen atom**, which is insufficient to accommodate both the -OH group and the carbonyl group (C=O).  
   **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
   - DoU = 2 (calculated as (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2).
   - This formula has **two oxygen atoms**, which can accommodate both the -OH group and the carbonyl group (C=O). Additionally, it allows for both the carbonyl and the double bond (C=C), consistent with the spectroscopic data.  
   **Retained.**

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
   - DoU = 1 (calculated as (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1).
   - Similar to Option A, this formula cannot account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the double bond (C=C).  
   **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic data and the degree of unsaturation is **C₆H₁₀O₂**. The FTIR data supports the presence of an -OH group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with a CH₃CO group or a related fragment.

Answer: C
