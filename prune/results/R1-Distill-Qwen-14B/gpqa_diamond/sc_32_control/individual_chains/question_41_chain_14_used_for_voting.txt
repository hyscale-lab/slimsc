Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and their speed relative to an observer when the glass is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, but I shouldn't just guess; I need to work it out.

Wait, right, when dealing with velocities in different frames, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving relative to the lab, and the light is inside the moving glass. But wait, is the light's speed inside the glass affected by the glass's motion?

No, wait. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But what about when the glass is moving?

So, the lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside the glass is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. So I need to transform this velocity to the lab frame.

Ah, right, using the velocity addition formula. So the formula for transforming velocities from one frame to another moving at velocity v relative to the first is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²))

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n. Wait, but c is the speed of light in vacuum. So when the light is in the glass, its speed is u = c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, no. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, I need to apply the velocity addition formula. Wait, the lab is the frame where the glass is moving at velocity v. So the glass is moving at +v relative to the lab. So from the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v.

So the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n. To find u' (the velocity in the lab frame), use u' = (u + v')/(1 + (u*v')/c² ), where v' is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Wait, no. I think the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)) when the other frame is moving at velocity v relative to us.

Wait, let me get the velocity addition formula right. Suppose I have an object moving at velocity u in frame S. Frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same axis. Then the velocity u' of the object in S' is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

In this case, in the glass's frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n. So what's the velocity in the lab frame (S), which is moving at v relative to S'? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the lab is S, and the glass is moving at v in S. So from S (lab) to S' (glass), the frame S' is moving at velocity v. So the velocity in S is u, and the velocity in S' is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, I think I've got that backward. Let me clarify: If the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S), then from the lab frame S, the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v. So if an object in S' has velocity u', then in S, its velocity u is given by u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

So in this problem, in the glass frame S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n. Because the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? So to find the velocity in the lab frame, we plug into the formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, wait, but u' is c/n. So substituting:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c )

Wait, so the numerator is (c/n + v)

Let me write it as:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Because denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal, so:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The (n) in numerator and denominator cancels with n in denominator. So we get:

u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, let's compute that:

Numerator: c(c + n v)

Denominator: n c + v

So,

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But wait, the speed of light in vacuum is c, and in the glass it's c/n, but when the glass is moving, how does it affect the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but wait, the speed of light should always be c in the lab frame, right? Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So this entire calculation must be wrong, because according to that, the speed of light in the lab frame would be c, regardless of the glass's motion.

Wait, but that's only when the light is in a vacuum. Wait, the light is inside a moving medium (glass). So how does that work?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light moves at c/n. But when the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is c, since light is a vacuum phenomenon. Or wait, no—because the light is in the glass, which is a medium. So maybe the velocity addition formula applies here.

Wait, but no, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light is traveling through the moving glass. So the speed of light in the lab frame is not necessarily c/n. It depends on the medium's properties and the observer's frame.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So regardless of the medium, in the lab frame, the light's speed is c. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, and the speed is c in any inertial frame. So when the glass is moving, the light inside it still should be moving at c in the lab frame.

Wait, but that can't be right because the glass has an index of refraction. So the speed of light inside the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, according to relativity, the light's speed in the lab frame would still be c, because the lab is an inertial frame and the speed of light is always c.

Wait, but that contradicts the initial approach of using velocity addition, which gave me [c(c + n v)]/(n c + v). So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, regardless of the medium's motion. Because the speed of light in a vacuum is c in any inertial frame, and when the light is in a medium, the medium's motion doesn't affect the speed of light in the lab frame. Wait, but the medium is moving, so perhaps the light's speed is different.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam toward the observer. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, irrespective of the source's motion or the medium's motion. So the answer should be c, which is option B.

But wait, in the problem, the options don't have c. Wait, the options are A, B, etc., and option B is 1. Oh, because c is taken as 1 in this problem statement. So the speed is 1.

Hmm, that seems too straightforward. But according to relativity, yes. So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about the velocity addition again.

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Substituting u' = c/n,

u = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So,

u = (c + n v )/(n (1 + v/(n c)) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Wait, let's compute it properly.

Denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that's [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let's suppose c=1, as in the problem. So substituting c=1, it becomes:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, so according to this, the speed of the light in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, this contradicts my earlier thought that the speed of light is always c (or 1) in the lab frame. So which is correct?

Hold on, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Because the velocity addition formula applies when you're dealing with velocities of objects, not the speed of light itself. Wait, because the speed of light is invariant. So if u' is the speed of light in the glass frame (which is 1/n), then in the lab frame, u must still be 1.

So that would mean that the velocity addition formula shouldn't change the speed of light to something else. So perhaps the approach of applying the formula is incorrect because the speed of light can't exceed c, and in fact, it's always c.

Wait, this is tricky. Let me think again.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v' = c/n. But when the glass moves at v relative to the lab, the lab sees a different velocity for the light. But according to relativity, the lab must measure the speed of light as c. So the velocity addition formula, when applied to the speed of light, must result in c.

Wait, let me test that. Let's take u' = c/n, v = velocity of glass in lab frame. What's u?

Using the formula u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

Substituting u' = c/n, c=1:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A, which is (1 + n v)/(n + v). But according to relativity, the speed should be 1. So this can't be right.

Wait, that suggests that the formula gives a different speed, which conflicts with relativity. So perhaps the mistake is in applying the velocity addition formula to the speed of light. Because the speed of light is invariant, it must remain c regardless of the frame. So this suggests that perhaps the velocity addition formula doesn't apply here, and the correct speed is c in the lab frame.

So this is confusing. Because according to the velocity addition formula, when u' is c/n, the resulting u would be (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. But according to relativity, u should be 1.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the light's speed in the medium depends on the frame. Or perhaps the speed of light is always c in the lab frame, regardless of the medium's motion. Let me think.

In a vacuum, yes, the speed is c in any inertial frame. But when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium is not necessarily c. Wait, no, wait. The speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties (index of refraction, etc.), but from the lab frame, which is an inertial frame, the speed of light (as measured in that frame) should still be c. So when the light is in the glass, which is moving, the lab would measure the light's speed as c.

Wait, that makes sense because the speed of light is invariant. So the correct answer is B, which is 1.

But how does that reconcile with the velocity addition formula giving a different result? Oh, wait, perhaps because when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is still c, so the velocity addition formula isn't applicable here because it's not just an object's velocity; it's light itself.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Imagine that the light is emitted from the glass towards the observer in the lab. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's velocity in the glass's frame is c/n. To find its velocity in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

Wait, but according to relativity, regardless of the glass's motion, the lab would measure the speed of light as c. So the answer is 1, option B.

But then why did the velocity addition formula give a different result? Because that formula applies to material objects, not light, maybe. Because for light, the speed is always c, regardless of the source's motion. So the velocity addition formula isn't used for light; it doesn't change the speed.

So in this problem, the correct answer is B, which is 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity. The light beam propagates through a glass medium with an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (Rest Frame of the Glass):**  
   In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \).

2. **Relativity of the Speed of Light:**  
   According to special relativity, the speed of light is invariant and always equals \( c \) in any inertial frame, including the laboratory frame. This means that even though the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), the observer in the lab will measure the speed of light as \( c \), regardless of the medium's motion or the light's speed in the glass's rest frame.

3. **Velocity Addition Formula Misapplication:**  
   While the velocity addition formula is typically used to transform velocities between inertial frames, it does not apply to the speed of light itself because the speed of light is invariant. Applying the formula to \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) would yield a result inconsistent with the principles of relativity, as the speed of light must remain \( c \) in all inertial frames.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The speed of light in the laboratory frame is always \( c \), irrespective of the glass's motion or the light's speed in the glass's rest frame. Since \( c = 1 \) in this problem, the speed of light in the lab frame is \( 1 \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)  
  This result comes from incorrectly applying the velocity addition formula to the speed of light, which is not valid due to the invariance of the speed of light.
  
- **Option B:** \( 1 \)  
  This is correct because the speed of light is always \( c = 1 \) in the laboratory frame, regardless of the glass's motion.

- **Option C:** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)  
  This is incorrect as it does not correspond to any valid transformation of the light's speed.

- **Option D:** \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)  
  This is incorrect and does not align with the principles of relativity.

### Final Answer:
The speed of light in the laboratory frame is \( 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in special relativity.

**Answer: B**
