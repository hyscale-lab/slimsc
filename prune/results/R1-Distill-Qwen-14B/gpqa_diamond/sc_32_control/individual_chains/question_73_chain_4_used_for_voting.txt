Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. There are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m, moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. I remember from my studies that relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as adding the velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for the total energy, since they're moving at relativistic speeds, I can't just use the classical kinetic energy; I need to use the relativistic formula which includes their rest mass energy.

Let me break it down into parts. First, finding the relative speed. Wait, wait. In relativity, if two objects are moving in the same direction, how do you find the speed of one relative to the other? I think the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Depending on the frame of reference.

Wait, correction: The relative velocity formula when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object and v is the velocity of the second as seen from the stationary frame. But in this problem, each astronaut is moving at their own speed in the same direction. So, to find the velocity of the 3m astronaut as seen from the 2m astronaut's frame, or vice versa?

Wait, the problem says "relative speed", which is symmetrical? Wait, no, relative velocity isn't symmetric in relativity. So maybe I should consider which one is moving faster. The 2m astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the 3m at 0.5c. So in the stationary frame, astronaut 1 (2m) is moving faster than astronaut 2 (3m).

So, to find the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame, we can use the formula. Or wait, maybe I should consider the other way around. Let me think. The formula for relative velocity when you have two frames: if frame S sees object A moving at u and object B moving at v, then from A's frame, the speed of B is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, direction matters here. Since both are moving in the same direction, if u > v, then the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, no, wait. No, wait, from A's frame, B is moving at v', so if frame S is the lab frame, and A is moving at u, then in A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Wait, yeah, considering that. So for the relative speed, if astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c, and astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, then from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 would be moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction; since astronaut 1 is moving faster, astronaut 2 is moving backward relative to astronaut 1. But the question is about speed, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. Alternatively, the problem might just be considering the magnitude, so 0.14c is the relative speed. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute the rest mass energies and add them.

Wait, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts. So for each, calculate their individual energies and sum.

So for the first astronaut (2m), v=0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m), v=0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c²≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy is E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option should be option C: v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Part 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the 2m astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the 3m astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c
\]

The negative sign in the numerator indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed, we take the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the 2m astronaut:
For \(v = 0.6c\):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the 3m astronaut:
For \(v = 0.5c\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
