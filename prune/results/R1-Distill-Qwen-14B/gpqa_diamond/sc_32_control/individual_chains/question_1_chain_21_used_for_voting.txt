Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two states. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the concept here? Oh right, I think it's related to the uncertainty principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty principle, which says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ over something else? I remember the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So in this case, the lifetime of each state is the time uncertainty Δt for each state. We need to find the minimum energy difference ΔE that can be resolved. Because if the energy difference is too small, the states might not be distinguishable.

Wait, but each state has a different lifetime. Oh wait, perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to its lifetime. Because ΔE would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt >= ħ/2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, the energy width of the state is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty (ΔE1 for state 1, ΔE2 for state 2) would be ħ divided by their respective lifetimes. So the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, the states might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think for two states to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that sum, the states' energy ranges might overlap, so you can't clearly tell them apart.

So let's compute the uncertainties for each state. The lifetimes are t1 = 1e-9 s and t2 = 1e-8 s.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I'll need to convert units.

Wait, but perhaps to find the energy differences, I can just compute ħ/Δt for each state, and then the energy difference must be greater than the sum of these two.

Wait, no, actually, each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) for each, but perhaps in this case, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Or maybe each state's energy is spread by their own ΔE, so the total spread between the two would be the sum.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, so that their energy ranges don't overlap. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 t1)
ΔE2 = ħ/(2 t2)

So ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but I need to convert this to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (5.27e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (5.27e-26)/(1.602e-19) ≈ approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 5.27e-26 divided by 1.602e-19.

5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (5.27/1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ approx 3.29 * 1e-7, so 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 t2) = (1.05e-34 J·s)/(2*(1e-8 s)) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (5.27/1.602) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, no, because 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27/1.602) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV. So ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of the two uncertainties is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV for the states to be distinguishable.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is 0.001e-7, which is much smaller than 3.6e-7. So this is too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → Even smaller. No way.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So this would be sufficient.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 10^-8 eV is 0.1e-7, but our required is about 3.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller.

Wait, wait, no. 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-8 is much smaller than 3.6e-7. So option D is 1e-8, which is smaller than required. So it's not enough.

So the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have messed up exponents.

Wait, let me recalculate ΔE1 and ΔE2 in eV.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 t1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-9) = 5.27e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 t2) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 = 3.29e-8 eV.

Sum of uncertainties: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the minimum required ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger. So option C is the correct answer.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For distinguishable states, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties of the two states:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2,
\]

where \( \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 t_1} \) and \( \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 t_2} \). The lifetimes are given as \( t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
1. For \( \Delta E_1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \Delta E_2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Sum of energy uncertainties
The total energy uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
For the states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
