Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get the details right.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The problem states that using the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the elemental abundances have been determined. The given values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So this implies log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → So nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, that is, [nSi_1 / nSi_2].

Hmm. I remember that the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Alternatively, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY / (nX/nY)_sun )

Wait, more accurately, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun

Which can be written as log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ) = log10( (n_X / n_Y) * (n_Y_sun / n_X_sun) )

So in terms of ratios, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) * (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun)^{-1} )

Alternatively, the [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundance in the star relative to the Sun.

Wait, let me think again. The definition is [X/Y] = log10 ( (n_X / n_Y)_star / (n_X / n_Y)_sun )

Which is the same as log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )

So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) − log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, to find n_Si for each star, I need to express [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], and perhaps the other [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H] for Star_2.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But I don't have [Si/Fe] for Star_2, I have [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Hmm. Let's see.

For Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 − log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

But wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is zero for [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Same for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg_2 / n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun → n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_2.

But wait, I'm not sure if [Fe/H] being zero implies that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe /n_H) divided by the same for the Sun. So [Fe/H] = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_star / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 1 → n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But how do I relate the hydrogen in each star? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think in terms of all elements relative to hydrogen.

Wait, let's model each star's composition.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → so n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no:

Wait, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si_1/n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Which can be rewritten as (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But from Star_1's [Fe/H], we know that n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

So substituting that into the equation for n_Si_1:

n_Si_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify this: (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, but n_Si_sun / n_H_sun is a constant, from the Sun's data. Let's compute that.

For the Sun, [Fe/H] is 7.5: wait, no, wait.

Wait, the problem states for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → nFe = nH * 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5) → nMg = nH * 10^(-5).

So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, nMg/nH is 1e-5.

So, n_Si_sun / n_H_sun = ?

Wait, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. Hmm. So we might need to find it or perhaps it's not needed.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si to H in each star in terms of their relative abundances.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

We have:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si_1 / n_H_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) ) ) = log10( (n_Si_sun /n H_sun * 10^{0.3} ) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log10(10^{0.3}) )= 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, that might not be the case. Because [Si/Fe] is 0.3, but [Fe/H] is 0, so [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that. Because [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], since [Fe/H] is 0, [Si/H] is 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, I have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

But also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → which implies log10(nMg_2 / nH_2) = log10(nMg_sun /nH_sun) → so nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun).

But I'm not sure how this connects. Let me think step by step.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun.

So n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Which can be written as (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Substituting n_Fe_1 from above:

n_Si_1 = (n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun)) ) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify that:

n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

So the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is (n_Si_1 / n_H_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Which would mean [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si_1 /nH_1 ) / (n_Si_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10(10^{0.3}) = 0.3.

So Star_1 has [Si/H] of 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → which implies that (nMg_2 /nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

But [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3.

Which gives (nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So nMg_2 = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

But we also know that nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

So putting these together:

nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

We can cancel nMg_sun from both sides.

(nH_2 /nH_sun ) = nSi_2 * (1 /nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranging:

nSi_2 = nSi_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun ) / 10^{0.3}.

Therefore, the ratio (nSi_2 /nH_2) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / 10^{0.3}.

So [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi_2 /nH_2) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10( (nSi_sun /nH_sun / 10^{0.3}) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10( 10^{-0.3} ) = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3, and Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

Wait, but the question is to find the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Hmm. So if I can find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star, then the ratio of silicon would depend on the ratio of hydrogen in each star as well.

Wait, because nSi_1 / nSi_2 = (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) * (nH_1 / nH_2 ) * (nH_2 / nSi_2) ).

Wait, no, perhaps better to think that:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 / 10^{0.3}.

So the ratio is nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 * 10^{0.3}) / (nH_2 /10^{0.3}) ) ] = (nH_1 /nH_2) * (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} ) ) = (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^{0.6}.

So to get this ratio, I need to find (nH_1 /nH_2).

But how? I know the masses of the stars, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to the hydrogen content. Wait, perhaps the stars have the same initial composition, so their hydrogen abundance is similar? Or maybe the mass relates to the total number of particles, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But without knowing their radii, it's hard to find their luminosity or surface area. But perhaps we can assume that the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the mass, but that might not be accurate because the composition varies.

Wait, but the problem says that LTE and EW method are used, which I think are about how the abundances are measured, not directly about the mass. Maybe the mass isn't directly relevant to the problem, and perhaps the ratio is just about the [Si/H] of the two stars.

Wait, but the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres would be (nSi_1 / nH_1) * (nH_1 /nH_2) * (nH_2 / nSi_2) ) → but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, but in the earlier conclusion, I have:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1 * 10^{0.3}.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 / 10^{0.3}.

So the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 *10^{0.3} ) / (nH_2 /10^{0.3} ) ] → = (nH_1 /nH_2) * (10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3}) ) → = (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, I'm stuck.

Wait, but what if the two stars have the same H abundance? Or is there another way to find (nH_1 /nH_2)?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same for both stars. But I don't think that's necessarily the case because they have different masses and different elemental compositions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the absolute number of H atoms, but the ratio of Si atoms relative to each other, considering their [Si/H] values.

Wait, let me think differently. The ratio of Si in the photospheres is n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But from the earlier analysis, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So,

n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

n_Si_2 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 = [ (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} ] / [ (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} } ]

Simplify:

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) * 10^{0.6}.

So I need to find (n_H_1 / n_H_2). But how?

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the total number of particles (including H and all other elements) is proportional to the mass. So, if the stars have the same composition, the total number of particles would be proportional to the mass. But in this case, their compositions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the star's mass, but only if the composition is the same. Since their compositions are different, this may not hold.

Hmmm, this is getting a bit complicated, and maybe I'm missing a simpler approach.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the ratio of Si atoms is the product of the [Si/H] ratios and the H ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of [Si/H] for both stars.

We have:

For Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si_1 / n_H_1) / (n_Si_2 / n_H_2) ) = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} }=10^{0.6}.

Which is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So the ratio of Si atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 would be approximately 4.

Wait, but that would be the case only if the ratio of H in each star is the same, which isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, but if the H abundance is the same in both stars, then n_H_1 = n_H_2, and the ratio would be 10^{0.6}.

But I don't think that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from the fact that the stars have a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, assuming that the mass is primarily due to H and He, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think again.

The problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So, the ratio is (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

We can express this as (n_Si_1 / n_H_1) * (n_H_1 / n_H_2) * (n_H_2 / n_Si_2) ) = (n_Si_1 /n_H_1) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2) ) * (n_H_1 /n_H_2).

But how to find (n_H_1 /n_H_2)?

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same metallicity (Fe abundance) relative to H, but that's only true for Star_1. Wait, for Star_2, their [Mg/H] is 0, similar to the Sun. But their [Fe/H] isn't given, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Wait, perhaps Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given, but Star_1's is 0.

Hmm, this is getting tangled. Maybe I should consider that the number of H atoms is related to the star's mass. For example, if the star's mass is M and the average molecular weight is μ, then the number of particles N is approximately (M / (μ m_H)) ), where m_H is the proton mass.

Assuming the stars are mostly H and He, perhaps. But without knowing the composition, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that for both stars, the H abundance is the same as the Sun. But that can't be, because their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are different.

Alternatively, maybe I should ignore the H ratio and just consider the [Si/H] values, which would give a ratio of 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A) ~3.9.

But wait, that would be the case if the H abundance is the same in both stars. But is that a valid assumption?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio cancels out. But I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me re-express the ratio n_Si_1/n_Si_2.

n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

n_Si_2 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = [ (n_H_1 /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} ] / [ (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} ] 

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) * 10^{0.6}.

So, this depends on the ratio of the H in each star.

But I don't have info on the H abundance. Wait, but the stars are more massive, so perhaps their H content is higher?

Alternatively, perhaps the overall metallicity (like [Fe/H]) affects this.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → so n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun).

But without knowing [Fe/H] for Star_2, I don't think I can relate n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the H ratio and just use [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

So,

n_Si_1 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

n_Si_2 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So the ratio is (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) = (n_H_1 /n_H_2) * (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) = (n_H_1 /n_H_2) * 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing (n_H_1 /n_H_2), I can't find this ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars? But that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio is the same as the mass ratio. Let's think: if the stars are more massive, then perhaps they have more H. Assuming that all the H is from the star's mass, perhaps n_H is proportional to the star's mass.

So, n_H_1 = 1.5 * n_H_sun, n_H_2 = 1.2 * n_H_sun.

Then,

n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = (1.5/1.2) * 10^{0.6} = (5/4) * 10^{0.6}.

Compute 10^0.6 → approx 3.98. So 5/4 is 1.25 → 1.25 * 3.98 ≈ 4.975. But that's close to option A (~3.9) only if I'm wrong about the mass assumption.

Wait, no, option A is ~3.9, which is about 10^0.6.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the H ratio and just take the [Si/H] ratio, which gives 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, so option A.

But that would assume that the H content is the same in both stars, which may not be the case. But perhaps the problem is structured that way.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to compute the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

As earlier:

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → n_Si_1/n_H_1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → n_Si_2/n_H_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

So the ratio (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) )= 10^{0.6}.

But this is the ratio of (n_Si_1/(n_Si_2)) ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1) ), which is 10^{0.6} * (n_H_2 /n_H_1).

So, unless (n_H_2 /n_H_1) = 1, the ratio isn't 10^0.6.

Wait, but if the problem assumes that the H content is the same in both stars, then the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the H ratio such that the mass cancels out. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the star is directly related to the total number of atoms. Let's say M = sum(m_i), where m_i is the mass of each element.

Assuming all masses are due to H, then M ∝ n_H * m_H.

So, for Star_1, M1 = 1.5 Msun → n_H_1 = M1/(m_H * A_H), where A_H is the average atomic mass (say, ~1 for H).

Similarly for Star_2, n_H_2 = M2/(m_H * A_H).

So, n_H_1 /n_H_2 = M1/M2 = (1.5)/(1.2) )=5/4=1.25.

So,

n_Si_1/n_Si_2 = (n_H_1/n_H_2) * 10^{0.6} = 1.25 * 10^{0.6}.

Compute 10^0.6 → approx 3.98.

So 1.25 *3.98 ≈4.975.

But none of the options match that. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm. This suggests that if I include the H ratio based on mass, the ratio is about 5, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 1.25 *3.98 is approximately 4.975, which is around 5, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not include the H ratio based on mass. In that case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would the problem not consider the H ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the [Si/H]_2 value. Let me recheck.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log10(n_Mg_2/n_H_2) = log10(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun).

Substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

log10( (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun ) ) / (n_Si_2) ) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )=0.3.

= log10( (n_Mg_sun * n_H_2 / (n_Si_2 * n_H_sun) ) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )=0.3.

= log10( (n_Mg/(n_Si)) * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) ) ) - log10(n_Mg/(n_Si)) ) =0.3.

= log10( (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) ) + log10(n_Mg/(n_Si)) ) - log10(n_Mg/(n_Si)) )=0.3.

Wait, no.

Wait, more accurately,

log10( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )=0.3.

But n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2/n_H_sun).

So,

log10( (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2/n_H_sun) ) / n_Si_2 ) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) = 0.3.

= log10( (n_Mg_sun * n_H_2 )/(n_Si_2 n_H_sun) ) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

= log10( n_Mg_sun/(n_Si_2 n_H_sun) ) + log10(n_H_2) - log10(n_Mg_sun) + log10(n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

Hmm, maybe I should factor it differently.

Let me factor out n_Mg_sun and n_Si_sun:

= log10( n_Mg_sun /n_Si_2 * (n_H_2/n_H_sun) ) ) - log10(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

= log10( (n_Mg_sun * n_H_2) / (n_Si_2 * n_H_sun) ) ) - log10( n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )=0.3.

= [ log10(n_Mg_sun) + log10(n_H_2) - log10(n_Si_2) - log10(n_H_sun) ] - [ log10(n_Mg_sun) - log10(n_Si_sun) ] =0.3.

Simplify:

log10(n_H_2) - log10(n_Si_2) - log10(n_H_sun) + log10(n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

= [log10(n_H_2) - log10(n_H_sun) ] + [ log10(n_Si_sun) - log10(n_Si_2) ] =0.3.

Which can be written as:

log10( n_H_2 /n_H_sun ) + log10( n_Si_sun /n_Si_2 ) =0.3.

But log10(a) + log10(b) = log10(a*b), so:

log10( (n_H_2 /n_H_sun) * (n_Si_sun /n_Si_2) ) ) =0.3.

Taking 10^0.3,

( n_H_2 * n_Si_sun ) / (n_Sun_H *n_Si_2) ) = 10^{0.3}.

Rearranged,

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H_2) / (n_Sun_H * 10^{0.3} ) ).

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps expressing it as:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H_2 / 10^{0.3}.

Which brings me back to my earlier conclusion that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, perhaps the only way to proceed is to assume that the H abundance in both stars is the same as the Sun. Then, n_H_1 =n_H_sun and n_H_2 =n_H_sun.

But that can't be, because Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, but [Mg/H]_2=0, but their masses are higher.

Wait, but if [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 =n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun).

Similarly, [Fe/H]_2 is not given, but [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun).

But without [Fe/H]_2, I can't find n_H_2 in terms of n_H_1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio and just compute the ratio of [Si/H], which gives 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y], which represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex**: This implies that the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we find:
  \[
  \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]
  This corresponds to **[Si/H]_1 = 0.3**.

### Star_2:
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex**: This implies that the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we find:
  \[
  \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}) \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{Si,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}
  \]
  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}
  \]
  This corresponds to **[Si/H]_2 = -0.3**.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}
\]
If we assume the hydrogen abundance ratio \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen content is the same in both stars), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]
This matches option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
