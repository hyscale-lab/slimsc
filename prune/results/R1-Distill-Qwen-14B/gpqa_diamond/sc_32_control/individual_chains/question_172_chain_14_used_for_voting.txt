Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that in Star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in Star 2. Oh right, excitation energy levels relate to the temperature of the star's photosphere. Since they're in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann distribution tells us how particles are distributed in energy states at a given temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So n_i is the number of particles in state i, n_j in state j. g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. Here, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, actually in the problem statement, the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So E_i minus E_j is that value.

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2. So, n1_i / n1_j = 2, and n2_i / n2_j = 1, perhaps? Or wait, maybe star 1 has higher excitation, so maybe n1_i is twice n2_i? Or wait, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, that could mean that the ratio of excited atoms to the ground state is higher in star 1. So for Star 1, the population ratio (n_i /n_j) is twice that of Star 2. So for Star 1, n1_i /n1_j = 2 * (n2_i /n2_j ). Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, the statement is that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So in star_1, the fraction of atoms in the excited state is higher. So the ratio n_i/n_j for star 1 is higher than for star 2.

So let's let for Star 1: ratio R1 = n_i /n_j = 2 * R2, where R2 is for Star 2.

But wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much in Star 1. So the ratio R1 = 2 * R2. Or maybe R1 is twice as high as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but each star's ratio depends on their own temperatures. So for each star, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for Star 1: R1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For Star 2: R2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Since the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), they'll cancel out when taking the ratio. So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, because when you take the ratio, R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/ [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Because when you subtract exponents, x/y = e^{(x - y)}.

So, R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. That's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm, so:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Wait, but the problem gives us the energy difference ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and k is the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Wait a minute, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

So, ΔE = k * something. Let me see.

If ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then (ΔE)/(k) = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) )= 1.

So, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = 1 * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is used to describe the distribution of atoms in energy states at a given temperature. The key equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the states, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For Star 1 and Star 2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Since the statistical weights \(g_i/g_j\) are the same for both stars, they cancel out when taking the ratio \(R_1/R_2\):

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in Star 1 is twice that of Star 2, so \(R_1 = 2R_2\). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
