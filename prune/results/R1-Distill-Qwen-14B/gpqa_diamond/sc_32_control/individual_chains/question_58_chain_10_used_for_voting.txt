Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then you remove it later after renormalizing.

Wait, so the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization. That probably means it's a theory that doesn't have these divergences, or maybe it's a theory that's already finite.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. Because it's a theory that includes strings as fundamental objects instead of point particles, it's supposed to be background-independent and, I think, finite. Do string theories require regularization? I'm not too sure, but I remember that in string theory, the perturbative expansion is different from quantum field theories. Maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences because of the way they handle interactions. Or perhaps they don't need regularization because the theory is inherently finite. Or maybe they do, but it's handled in a different way.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. I'm pretty sure that QCD requires regularization because when you compute loop diagrams, you get divergences. But wait, QCD is a theory that's asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have divergences. Regularization is a necessary step in handling loop integrals, so I think QCD does require regularization. Although, because it's asymptotically free, maybe the divergences are less severe? Or perhaps it's only superrenormalizable? No, QCD is a non-superrenormalizable theory because it's a four-dimensional theory with a dimensionless coupling, which leads to needing an infinite number of counterterms. So yeah, QCD definitely uses regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood theory. I know that QED does require regularization because when you calculate loops, like the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. These divergences are handled through renormalization, which involves absorbing the infinities into counterterms. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical theory, not the quantum one. So in classical Maxwell's equations, there are no infinities or divergences that require regularization. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical E&M, you don't have issues with divergent loop integrals. You might have point charges and their fields, but those are handled by other methods, like the Dirac delta function for point charges. So the classical theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't deal with quantum loops and their divergences. So this theory never requires regularization.

Wait, the question is which theory never requires regularization. So if D is the classical version, then it doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me double-check. The question is about when they're applied at high energies. So, in Quantum Electrodynamics, even at high energies (but non-Planck scale), you still need to regularize. But for the classical theory, no matter how high the energy, there's no regularization needed because it's not a quantum theory.

So the correct answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

1. **Superstring Theory (Option A):** Superstring theory is a candidate for quantum gravity and is background-independent. While it differs from quantum field theories in handling interactions, it still involves perturbative expansions and loop diagrams, which can lead to divergences. Although string theory is often finite in certain formulations, regularization may still be necessary in some contexts. Thus, it is not guaranteed to never require regularization.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (Option B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, is a non-abelian gauge theory. It requires regularization due to divergences in loop integrals, even though it is asymptotically free. These divergences necessitate renormalization, confirming that QCD requires regularization.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (Option C):** QED, the theory of electromagnetism, also requires regularization. Divergences appear in loop calculations, such as the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These are handled through renormalization, indicating that QED needs regularization.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (Option D):** This is the classical theory of electromagnetism, described by Maxwell's equations. Unlike quantum field theories, classical electrodynamics does not involve quantum loops or divergences that require regularization. It is a deterministic theory where infinities, such as those associated with point charges, are handled differently. Therefore, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

The theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
