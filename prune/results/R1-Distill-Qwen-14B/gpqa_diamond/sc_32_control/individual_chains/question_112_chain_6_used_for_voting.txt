Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to walk through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is usually denoted as S_z. So, the state is a linear combination of these basis states.

First, I think I need to normalize the state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. To normalize, I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then divide each coefficient by the square root of that inner product.

Let me write down the state: |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients become (1-i) and (2+i) respectively.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So each term is the coefficient times its complex conjugate.

So, for the |up> component: (1+i)(1-i) = (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) → 1 -i +i -i². Oh wait, simplifies to 1 - (-1) = 2. Because (a+bi)(a−bi) = a² + b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1² +1² = 2.

Similarly, the |down> component: (2-i)(2+i) = (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

Wait, so the inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|² + |2−i|². So that's (1² +1²) + (2² +1²) )= (2) + (5) =7. So the state is normalized if it's divided by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix representation is A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think: 

Matrix A has zeros on the diagonal because when i=j, A_ij is zero. And off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0   ]

Hmm, I think that's correct. Because for a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but this looks familiar. Oh, right! This is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s on the off-diagonal, but this has hbar/2. So, A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, Pauli matrices are defined as σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, A is (hbar/2) times σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x. Let me recall what those states are.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>) and (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down>). Wait, no: the eigenvalues for σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenstate for +1 is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and for -1 is (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2). But wait, in our case, |up> and |down> correspond to the eigenstates of S_z, which are the same as |0> and |1> in some conventions. So maybe I should represent them as |+x> and |−x>?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work with the matrix representation and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Wait, but wait: since A is proportional to σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1, then A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2.

But the question is about measuring the eigenstates of A. So the possible outcomes when measuring A are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the state in each eigenstate.

So, first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because then, the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the coefficient in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate to find the probability.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to diagonalize the matrix A. Since A is (hbar/2) times σ_x, which is already diagonalized in the |+x>, |-x> basis. So to express |alpha> in this basis, I can find the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write the state |alpha> in the standard basis (|up>, |down>), then express it in the |+x>, |-x> basis.

Wait, |+x> is (1/sqrt(2))( |up> + |down> ), and |-x> is (1/sqrt(2))( |up> - |down> ).

So, to find the coefficients in the |+x> and |-x> basis, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

Let me compute that. Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, this would be:

c_+ [ (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ] + c_- [ (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) ]

Which simplifies to [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But from the given |alpha>, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2−i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So, equating the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)  → Equation 1

( c_+ − c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 − i)/sqrt(7) → Equation 2

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for c_+ and c_-.

Let me add Equations 1 and 2:

[ (c_+ + c_-) + (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / sqrt(7)

This gives (2 c_+ ) / sqrt(2) ) = (3) / sqrt(7)

So, 2 c_+ / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(7)

→ c_+ = (3/(2)) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

[ (c_+ + c_-) − (c_+ − c_-) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] / sqrt(7)

So (2 c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = [ (1 + i - 2 + i ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: (-1 + 2i) → (−1 + 2i )

So (2 c_- ) / sqrt(2) ) = (−1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7 )

→ c_- = [ (−1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ) / ( 2 sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the squared magnitudes of c_+ and c_- to find the probabilities.

So, |c_+|^2 = [ (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) ]^2 = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7 ) ) = (18)/(28) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = [ (−1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) ) ]^2.

Compute numerator: (−1 + 2i ) → magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. Then multiply by (sqrt(2))^2 =2. So 5 *2=10.

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))^2 =4 *7=28.

So |c_-|^2 = 10/28 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571429.

Hmm, but wait, let's add these two probabilities: (9/14) + (5/14) =14/14=1. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options given don't include 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3 hbar / sqrt(7)

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar / sqrt(7)

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. And 5/14 is approximately 0.357, around 0.36. So that matches option A's first two numbers: 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me think again. Because another approach: perhaps I should have diagonalized the operator A, found its eigenstates, then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is not diagonal in the standard basis, so the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the expansion.

Wait, perhaps using a different approach: since A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then the eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I)=0.

The matrix becomes [[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) =0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- = -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for λ_+ would satisfy (A - λ I)|v> = 0.

So:

[ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ] [a; b] = 0 → -hbar/2 * a + hbar/2 * b =0 → -a + b =0 → b=a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1), which is |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ_- = -hbar/2, the equation gives (A + (hbar/2) I) |v> =0 → matrix [[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, hbar/2 ] ].

The equation is (hbar/2) a + (hbar/2) b =0 → a + b=0 → b = -a → eigenvector (1, -1), which is |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2}.

So, yes, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, as I thought earlier.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ] / sqrt(2) 

Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So the inner product is:

( (1+i) + (2−i) ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) )

Simplify numerator: (1+i +2−i) =3.

So, 3 / sqrt(14).

The amplitude c_+ is 3 / sqrt(14).

So the probability is |c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈0.642857.

Similarly, compute < −x | alpha >.

<−x| alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2−i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ] / sqrt(2).

So, numerator: (1+i) − (2−i) = (1−2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i).

So the amplitude is ( -1 +2i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → ( -1 +2i ) / sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

So the first part of the answer is 0.64 (approx) and 0.36.

Looking back at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in the |+x> and |−x> basis with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, the average would be sum (prob_i * lambda_i).

So, <A> = P_+ * (hbar/2) + P_- * (-hbar/2).

P_+ is 9/14, P_- is 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) * hbar ]/(28) )= (4 hbar)/(28) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at option A: the average is hbar/7. So this matches.

So the correct option is A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the average calculation using the operator matrix.

Alternatively, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) (0) (1+i) + (1 -i)(hbar/2)(2-i) + (2 +i)(hbar/2)(1+i) + (2 +i)(0)(2 −i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute <alpha| A |alpha> as (1/7) [ <up| + <down| ] A [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

Compute each term.

First, write A acting on |alpha>.

A |alpha> = (1+i) A |up> + (2−i) A |down>.

But A|up> is the first column of A times |up> and |down>.

Wait, A|up> = 0 * |up> + (hbar/2) |down> = (hbar/2)|down>.

Similarly, A|down> = (hbar/2)|up> + 0 |down> = (hbar/2)|up>.

So,

A |alpha> = (1+i) (hbar/2) |down> + (2−i) (hbar/2) |up>.

Then,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * [ (2−i)(hbar/2) |up> + (1+i)(hbar/2) |down> ]

Compute each inner product:

= (1/7) (hbar/2) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) <up|up> + (1 - i)(1 + i) <up|down> + (2 +i)(2 -i) <down|up> + (2 +i)(1 +i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|down> =0 and <down|up>=0.

So, the cross terms vanish.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) [ (1 - i)(2 -i) *1 + (2 +i)(1 +i) *1 ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i = 1-3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

Adding these: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So,

= (1/7)(hbar/2) * 2 = (1/7)(hbar) → hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the expectation is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

The problem involves a quantum state |α⟩ proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to normalize the state, calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise, and find the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is \( |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \). To normalize, compute the inner product \( ⟨α|α⟩ \):
\[
⟨α|α⟩ = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]
These are also the eigenstates of \( A \).

### Step 3: Express \( |α⟩ \) in the \( |+x⟩, |-x⟩ \) basis
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of \( A \), express \( |α⟩ \) in terms of \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \):
\[
|α⟩ = c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |-x⟩.
\]
Substituting \( |+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩) \) and \( |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩) \), we solve for \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
P_+ = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P_- = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P_+ \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P_- \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( P_+ = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P_- = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
