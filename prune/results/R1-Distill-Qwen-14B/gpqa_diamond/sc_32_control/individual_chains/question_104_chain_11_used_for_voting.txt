Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

The question says that two stars with identical masses are being observed. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the setup is that both stars are like our Sun, and each has a Neptune-sized planet.

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1's host star shows a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's host has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is Planet #2's orbital period compared to Planet #1's?

Wait, so the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think the formula involves Kepler's third law. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than the Sun's mass), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, more accurately, the semi-amplitude K can be approximated as:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since both stars have the same mass and the planets are similar, maybe the sin i (inclination) factor is the same? Or perhaps we can ignore it because the question doesn't mention inclination differences. So, assuming sin i is the same for both, which might not be the case, but the question doesn't give any info about inclination, so perhaps it's assumed to be the same, or that it cancels out.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), perhaps? Let me think again. The formula I recall is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p / M_*) )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps that's a bit complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between K and P.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Since the problem says both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (both Neptune), the main variable here is the orbital period. But wait, the shifts are different (5 vs 7 milliangstroms), which correspond to different K values.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), as per the simplified formula. Since M_p is the same for both planets (both Neptune mass), M_* is same for both stars (same mass as Sun), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, because K1 = (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ), and K2 similarly. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 / M_p1) * (M_*2 / M_*1 )^(2/3). But M_p and M_* are same for both, so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express this. If K1 = (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) ), and K2 = (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) ), then K1/K2 = [ (1/P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3) ) ] = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because K1 = const * 1/(P1^(1/3)), K2 = const * 1/(P2^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, but the question gives K1 and K2 as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7, so K1 < K2. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then a larger K implies a smaller P. Because if P increases, 1/P^(1/3) decreases, so K decreases.

So we have K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

From earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1. Because (5/7)^3 is about (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 = 0.364 * P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 of P1, that's 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Because I might have gotten the ratio backwards.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P is inversely proportional to K^3.

Wait, if K increases, P decreases, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 =5, K2=7 → K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

So the ratio of periods P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3.

5/7 is approx 0.714, cubed is 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1 → which is about 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is about 0.36 times longer, which is 36% of P1. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is much shorter.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, wait, but the question is presented as Planet #1 having a 5 milliangstrom shift, Planet #2 a 7. So K1=5, K2=7.

So K2>K1 → so P2 < P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

So P2 = (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364 → approx 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer should be option A, ~0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the period ratio:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and cubing this:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately \( 0.364 \) times \( P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 36% of that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is **shorter** than that of Planet #1 by a factor of approximately \( 0.36 \).

The question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \). Since \( P_2 \) is shorter, the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) is \( 0.36 \), corresponding to option A.
