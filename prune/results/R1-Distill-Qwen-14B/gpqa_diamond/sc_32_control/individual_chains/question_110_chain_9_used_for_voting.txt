Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters: RA, DEC, absolute or apparent V magnitude, distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)). The key point is that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can detect stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO (since it's more sensitive to fainter stars), and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES (since it's more sensitive, but not as much as ESPRESSO). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," meaning that ESPRESSO can see stars that have apparent magnitudes less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V mag less than 16. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. But wait, no, wait. Because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be observable by both instruments. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). Wait no, because ESPRESSO can go fainter (up to 17), while HIRES can only go up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). So the more strict condition is that the apparent V mag must be <16, because if it's <16, then HIRES can see it, and since 16 <17, ESPRESSO can also see it. Wait, no, because if a star has apparent V mag 16.5, it's too faint for HIRES (needs to be <16), but ESPRESSO can see it (as 16.5 <17). So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 (so that it's bright enough for HIRES) and also <=17 (which it already satisfies if it's <=16). So the key is that the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16, but wait, the problem says "brighter than 17" can be observed with ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, "brighter than 17" means apparent magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is apparent magnitude less than 16.

So, for both instruments to detect the star, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if the apparent V is less than 16, then it's bright enough for HIRES, and since it's also less than 17, it's bright enough for ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 mag, so a star with apparent V 16.5 is too faint for HIRES (needs to be <16) but can be observed by ESPRESSO. But the question is which stars can be seen by both. So only stars with apparent V mag less than 16 can be seen by both. Because if the apparent V is 16 or lower, HIRES can see it (since it's brighter than 16), and since 16 is less than 17, ESPRESSO can also see it.

So the first step is to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening) which reduces brightness (makes it appear fainter, higher magnitude).

Wait, because the question mentions E(B-V) for some stars, and that the total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So the extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). This extinction will make the apparent magnitude higher (fainter) than the intrinsic magnitude.

So the apparent V magnitude is equal to the intrinsic (absolute) V magnitude plus the extinction (A_V). But wait, wait: the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V, where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and A_V is the extinction.

Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V. Because M is the absolute magnitude (what the star would appear at 10 pc), and then you add the distance modulus (5 log(d/10)) and the extinction (which adds to the apparent magnitude).

So for each star, I need to calculate its apparent V magnitude (m) as:

m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V

But wait, some stars have apparent V magnitude given directly, so for those, I don't need to compute m. But for others, I have to compute m using their absolute V and distance.

Let's go through each star.

Star1: absolute V=15.5, distance=10 pc, no E(B-V). So m = 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) + 0 = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So m=15.5. Since 15.5 <16, it's observable by both.

But wait, what about E(B-V)? Star1's E(B-V) isn't given, so A_V is 0. So m= M + 5 log(d/10) → 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So m=15.5.

Star2: apparent V=16.5 mag, E(B-V)=0 (no info, but it's given as apparent, so we don't compute m). So m=16.5. This is greater than 16 (HIRES limit is less than 16), so it's 16.5>16. So HIRES can't observe it, but ESPRESSO can (16.5 <17). So Star2 can be observed only by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: apparent V=15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, but wait, Star3's apparent V is already given. Do I need to correct for extinction? Hmm, the problem says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but also E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, that's confusing. Because the apparent magnitude already includes extinction? Or is the apparent magnitude the uncorrected magnitude, and I need to add the extinction? Hmm, the question says that the "apparent V magnitude" is given, but E(B-V) is provided. So perhaps the given apparent V is the observed one (including extinction), or is it the intrinsic?

Wait, no, in astronomy, the apparent magnitude is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So the E(B-V) is the reddening (dust along the line of sight). So if a star has E(B-V)=0.6, then the extinction A_V is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 magnitudes. But wait, the problem says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5 mag. So the extinction would have made it appear fainter. So the apparent V is already 15.5, which includes the extinction. So perhaps I don't need to adjust it. Alternatively, maybe the given apparent magnitude is the true (intrinsic) m, and I have to compute the observed m with extinction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's read the note again: "For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes as well as the altitudes of the telescopes." But the key part is about the extinction: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the absorption A_V =3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86.

But Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5 mag. So is that the observed magnitude (including extinction) or the intrinsic magnitude (without extinction)?

Wait, the problem states: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6". Hmm, that suggests that the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude would be higher because of the extinction. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude, say m0, and it has extinction A_V, then the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V.

So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86, then the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36. Which is way above the limits for both instruments. So that would make Star3 too faint to be observed by either. But that seems odd because the question includes E(B-V) for some stars, so I must consider that.

Wait, but perhaps I got it reversed. Let me think: the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, but due to extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V. So if the problem gives Star3's apparent V as 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, then the observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. So that would be too faint for both ESPRESSO (needs <17) and just barely over. So Star3's apparent V is 17.36, which is more than 17, so it can't be detected by ESPRESSO either.

But wait, that can't be right because the question's options include Star3 in some options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the given apparent V is the intrinsic value, and I need to calculate the observed m by adding A_V.

Wait, let me re-express. Let's say that the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m0. Then, the observed m is m0 + A_V. So if the problem gives the apparent magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then the observed m is 15.5 + (3.1 * 0.6) = 15.5 + 1.86=17.36.

So in that case, m is 17.36, which is above the ESPRESSO limit of 17, so it can't be detected by either. Hmm, but let's check Star4.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So for Star4, M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute its apparent V (m) as M + 5 log(d/10) + A_V.

M is 15.5, d=10 → 5 log(1) =0. A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

So m =15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74. So for ESPRESSO: 16.74 <17 → detectable. For HIRES: 16.74 >16 → not detectable by HIRES. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO, but not by HIRES.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Since E(B-V) isn't given, A_V=0.

So m= M +5 log(d/10) +0.

M=16.5, d=5 → log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010.

So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995 → approx 15.0.

So m=15.0. So for HIRES, 15<16 → detectable. For ESPRESSO, 15<17 → detectable. So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star5's calculation because it's a key star.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute m = M +5 log(d/10) + A_V.

d=5 → log(5/10)=log(0.5)=~ -0.3010.

5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 + (-1.505) + 0 (since no E(B-V)).

16.5 -1.505 =14.995 → ~15.0.

So m=15.0, which is less than 16, so detectable by both.

Now, let's go back to Star3.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

But wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance." Wait, Star3's parameters are: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if a star has an apparent V magnitude, it's observed, so the m given already includes any extinction. So in that case, the calculation for m is already what it is. So perhaps I don't need to add A_V again. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the given data.

Wait, perhaps the apparent V magnitude given in the star's description is the observed, which already includes extinction. But in that case, the E(B-V) is given, but perhaps it's irrelevant because the apparent V is already provided. So I think perhaps for stars that have apparent V given, we don't need to compute m; but for those with absolute V and distance, we compute m.

Wait, but the question says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." If the apparent V is 15.5, that's what's observed, including extinction. So perhaps in that case, the E(B-V) is extra information that isn't needed for this calculation because the apparent magnitude is given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute m without considering the extinction, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again.

The question is about the apparent V magnitude of each star as observed by the instruments. So for each star, I need to calculate m, the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction.

For stars that have their apparent V given (like Star2 and Star3), perhaps the given m is the observed value, which already includes extinction. So for those, I don't need to compute m again.

Wait, Star2's parameters: apparent V=16.5, and E(B-V)=0.6? No, no, looking back, no. Wait, Star2's parameters are: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V=16.5, distance=5 pc. So E(B-V) isn't given. So for Star2, we don't have E(B-V), so no extinction. So m=16.5. Which is acceptable for ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but Star3's E(B-V)=0.6. So for Star3, we have apparent V=15.5, but perhaps that's the observed m, but E(B-V) would imply that the intrinsic m is lower. But wait, I'm not sure. Because the apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. So perhaps I don't need to adjust it.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V given is the intrinsic (without extinction), and I need to add the extinction. So Star3's m = 15.5 (intrinsic) + 1.86 (A_V) = 17.36. So that's m=17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's limit of 17, so not detectable by either.

But that would mean Star3 can't be detected by either, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 m=16.74 (only ESPRESSO). Star5 m=15.0 → both. So A includes Star4, which can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not both. Wait, but Star5 can be detected by both. So A is Star4 and Star5: Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, so perhaps A is not correct.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. But if Star3's m is 17.36, it can't be detected by either. So B is wrong.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2's m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO. Star3's m=17.36 → neither. So C is wrong.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1's m=15.5 → both (since 15.5 <16), and Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO. So D is wrong because Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

But wait, Star5 can be detected by both. So the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5, but if Star3's m is 17.36, it can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Star3.

Let me think again. The problem states for Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6 implies A_V=1.86. But wait, that can't be because the observed m includes the extinction. So perhaps the given apparent V is the observed m, which is already higher than the intrinsic m. So perhaps I don't need to adjust it further. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is less than 16 → detectable by both. But that would make Star3 observable by both.

Wait, but that would mean Star3 has m=15.5, which is <16, so detectable by both. But then, considering E(B-V), perhaps the star's actual m would be higher, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the apparent V magnitude given for Star3 is the observed one, which includes extinction. So the E(B-V) is extra information that doesn't affect the current calculation, because the apparent V is already given. So for Star3, m=15.5. So for both instruments, yes. Let me re-calculate all stars with this approach.

Let me re-do the calculations for each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m =15.5 +5 * log(10/10) +0 (no extinction) → 15.5 +0=15.5. So m=15.5. Both instruments can detect it.

Star2: apparent V=16.5, no E(B-V). So m=16.5. HIRES can't (needs <16), ESPRESSO can. So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Since m is already given as 15.5, and E(B-V) might not affect this value (because apparent V already includes extinction), so m=15.5. Both can detect it.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24. So m =15.5 + 5 log(10/10) +1.24 →15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74. HIRES (needs <16) can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can (16.74 <17).

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc, no E(B-V). So m=16.5 +5 log(5/10) → 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0. So m=15.0. Both can detect.

Wait, that's different from earlier. So in this scenario, Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable for both. So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: ESPRESSO only. Star5: both. So A includes one that can be detected by both (Star5) and one that can't (Star4). So A includes one correct and one incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both detectable by both. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check:

Star3's m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5's m=15.0 → both can detect.

So option B is Star3 and Star5. So that's an option. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no, Star4 only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes, both detectable.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only ESPRESSO, Star3 detectable by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 by both, Star4 only ESPRESSO.

Wait, but according to this, Star3 and Star5 are both detectable by both instruments. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought Star3's m would be 17.36. But perhaps I was wrong because the given apparent V already includes extinction, so I don't need to add it again.

So in that case, the correct answer would include Star1, Star3, and Star5 as detectable by both. But looking at the options, the only option that includes two stars detectable by both is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4). But Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is which of the following stars can be detected with both. So correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 is in both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both are detectable by both.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but looking back at Star3's parameters, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6". If the apparent V already includes extinction, then m=15.5 is the observed value, and E(B-V) is extra information. So Star3 is detectable by both.

So the answer includes Star3 and Star5, making option B correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, Star1's m=15.5, which is <16, so detectable by both, so Star1 is also a candidate. But looking at the options, none of them includes Star1 and Star5. The options are:

A) 4 and 5: only 5 is correct.

B)3 and5: both correct.

C)2 and3: 3 is correct, 2 isn't.

D)1 and4: 1 is correct, 4 isn't.

So the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't have an option with all three. So the possible options are:

Option B: 3 and5.

Option D: 1 and4.

But earlier, with the assumption that the given apparent V includes extinction, Star3's m=15.5 is acceptable. So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the given apparent V is the uncorrected magnitude, and I should calculate the observed m by adding A_V.

Let me re-calculate for Star3 under this assumption.

Star3: apparent V=15.5 (without extinction), E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So observed m=15.5+1.86=17.36. Which is too faint for both. So Star3 cannot be detected by either.

In that case, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, is there an option that includes both? Let's see:

Option A: 4 and5 → 5 is correct, 4 isn't.

Option B:3 and5 → 5 correct, 3 not.

Option D:1 and4 → 1 correct,4 not.

So the correct answer would be an option that includes Star1 and Star5, but looking at the options, there's no such option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the apparent V.

Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent V includes the extinction, so m=15.5. Then, the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options don't include an option with all three. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the problem states that for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction. So for stars with given apparent V, I should adjust for extinction if E(B-V) is provided.

So:

- Star1: M=15.5, d=10, no E(B-V). So m=15.5.

- Star2: m=16.5, no E(B-V). So m=16.5.

- Star3: given m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5 + (3.1 * 0.6) → 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make m=17.36, which is higher than the given m. That doesn't make sense. Because the given apparent V should already include extinction. So perhaps the approach is that for stars with given apparent V, we don't need to adjust for E(B-V). Because the given m is the observed value, which includes any extinction.

So, for Star3, m=15.5 (already includes extinction), so it's acceptable for both.

Similarly, Star4: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4. So m=15.5 + (5 log(10/10)) + (3.1*0.4) →15.5 + 0 +1.24=16.74.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5, no E(B-V). So m=16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5+(-1.505)=14.995≈15.0.

So the stars that can be detected by both are:

- Star1: m=15.5 → both.

- Star3: m=15.5 → both.

- Star5: m=15.0 → both.

So the correct options would be any that include two of these. Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 is correct.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star3 correct, Star2 not.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 correct, Star4 not.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering any extinction effects. The key criteria are:

1. **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$).
2. **HIRES** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$).

For a star to be detectable by both instruments, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy $m < 16$.

- **Apparent V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m = 16.74 > 16$, detectable only by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star5**
- **Absolute V magnitude**: $M = 16.5$

- **Apparent V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 \approx 15.0
  \]
- **Conclusion**: $m = 15.0 < 16$, detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.
