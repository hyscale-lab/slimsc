Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves reactions with reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on an unknown compound, producing different enantiomers of the same ketone. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from reaction A and (S)-the same product from reaction B.

Wait, so reaction A used LiBH4 and H+, and reaction B used BH3 and H+. I remember that the choice of reducing agent can affect the product, especially in terms of stereochemistry.

I think LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones. But wait, BH3 is a different one—it's a milder reagent, right? Oh wait, no, BH3 is typically used for aldehydes and ketones as well. Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused with other reactions. Or perhaps it's about the conditions and the solvents used. Oh, right! BH3 is usually used in a less polar solvent, like THF, and can lead to different stereochemical outcomes compared to other borohydrides.

Wait no, the key here might be the type of reducing agent and how they affect the stereochemistry in ketone reductions. Oh, but wait, LiBH4 and BH3 don't typically cause changes in the stereochemistry of the starting material if it's a simple ketone. Or do they? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up with other reactions like epoxide openings or something else.

Wait, the products are both the same compound but different enantiomers. So the starting materials must have been different enantiomers themselves. Because each reaction produced a different stereoisomer.

Wait, let me think. When you reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which suggests that perhaps the starting material was an epoxide or a cyclic ketone? Or maybe a carbonyl group in a cyclic structure.

Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone—pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2-position is the ketone, and 4-ethyl. So the ring is O-C5H9-C-O? Wait, the structure would be a six-membered ring with O at position 1, ketone at 2, and ethyl at 4.

Hmm, so the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something? No, wait, it's a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms the tetrahydro pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material was an epoxide. Because when you reduce an epoxide, you can get a diol. But then again, in this case, the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material was a cyclic ketone, and the reducing agent is being used in a way that forms another structure. Or maybe it's about the stereochemistry of the reduction leading to different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the starting material could be a diethyl acetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When that's reduced, it could open up and form a diol or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or another type of carbonyl compound. Let me think about the product. The product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that, when reduced, forms that ring.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal—no, it's a pyranone, so it's a cyclic ketone, not an acetal. So the starting material might have been a carbonyl group in a structure that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent. Alternatively, the starting material is a di-substituted carbonyl, and the reduction leads to the ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone that, when reduced, forms a cyclic secondary alcohol. But wait, the product is a ketone. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no—the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So if the starting material is a cyclic ketone, maybe the reduction isn't breaking the ring but doing something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When you reduce a lactone, you typically get a diol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Reducing that could lead to a dihydro structure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction opens up to form the ring. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reducing agents. LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, BH3 is typically used in the hydroboration reaction, right? But in this case, it's being used with H+, so perhaps it's a BH3-H2O workup? Or maybe it's BH3 followed by something else.

Wait, no, the reagents are LiBH4 plus H+ and BH3 plus H+. Oh, wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones, esters, amides, etc. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which add boron to double bonds. But in this problem, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that's being reduced.

Wait, but if you reduce a ketone (like R2CO), you would get an alcohol (R2CHOH). But the product here is another ketone. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide with a reducing agent, you might get a diol. But the product is a cyclic ketone. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, lactones. When you reduce a lactone, you get a diol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, not a diol. So that's not it.

Alternatively, the starting materials could be alpha,beta-unsaturated esters. For example, when you reduce an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with something like LiBH4, it can add across the double bond, creating a diol. But again, how does that lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compounds are esters that, upon reduction, form cyclic ketones. Wait, that would require a specific structure.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydropyranone. Tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So the starting material must have had a carbonyl group that upon reduction forms this ring. Maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with a carbonyl group, and the reduction forms the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a keto ester. For example, an ester where the ester oxygen is connected to a carbonyl group. When such a compound is reduced, perhaps the ester is converted into an alcohol, which could cyclize to form the pyranone.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product is (R) and (S) for each reaction. So each starting material must have given rise to a specific configuration.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Because when you reduce an epoxide, you can get a diol with specific stereochemistry. But if the product is a cyclic ketone, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. When you reduce them, they form diols, but I'm not sure. Again, the product is a ketone, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a carbonyl group. For example, an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, upon reduction, the epoxide opens to form an alcohol, and the carbonyl is reduced as well. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals or acetals. When reduced, they break open, but again, that doesn't directly lead to a cyclic ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the options given.

The options are for the starting materials A and B. Both are (S) or (R) enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, that structure: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the formula would be CH2-COOH, but with substituents.

Breaking it down:

The parent chain is pentanoic acid (5 carbons), with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH(CH2)2CH3)-COOH

Wait, perhaps. Let me draw it as:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl group)

Carbon 4: C=O (since it's 5-oxo, wait no. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Wait, 5-oxo would be the fifth carbon being a carbonyl. But wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, with the COOH on carbon 5.

Wait, no, wait: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but more correctly, the carbon chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the 5-oxo group would be on the same carbon as the COOH? No, because the COOH is on carbon 5. So 5-oxo would imply a carbonyl group on carbon 5, which is the same as the COOH? That can't be, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, no, wait, 5-oxopentanoic acid would mean that the pentanoic acid has a ketone at position 5. But the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the carbonyl is already at the end. So having a 5-oxo would mean another carbonyl on the same carbon as the COOH? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the structure is such that the COOH is on carbon 1, and the 5-oxo is on carbon 5. Wait, but that would be a 5-carbon chain, so carbon 5 would be the end. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

O
||
O-C-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)2 

Wait, no, maybe it's more like:

The compound is pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents on carbon 3 (ethyl) and carbon 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups). So the formula is:

CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

At carbon 3, an ethyl group.

At carbon 5, both an isobutoxy group and an oxo group.

So the structure would be:

CH2-COOH

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents on the third and fifth carbons.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Now, the key is that when A and B are treated with different reducing agents, they produce different enantiomers of the same ketone. So the starting materials A and B must be enantiomers themselves, because the same reduction would lead to the same stereochemistry in the product unless the starting material's configuration is different.

Wait, but the reducing agents are different. So perhaps the reducing agents are leading to different stereochemical outcomes based on their own properties.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both used in the same type of reaction—reducing carbonyl groups. So perhaps the choice of reducing agent affects the stereochemistry of the product. For example, in some reductions, the borohydride can approach from a certain face, leading to a certain stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, but in the case of ketones, the reduction to secondary alcohols is generally not stereoselective because the carbonyl is planar. So unless there is some kind of neighboring group participation or the carbonyl is part of a chiral environment, the reduction wouldn't create any new stereocenters.

Wait a minute, but in this case, the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that upon reduction forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and the reduction leads to a diol, but that doesn't directly explain the product.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclohexenone or another cyclic ketone. When reduced, it forms a dihydro structure, but that doesn't fit the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. Upon reduction, the oxygen is converted, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo reduction, but I'm not exactly sure how that leads to the product.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide, and the reducing agent induces ring opening to form a diol, but that's a diol, not a ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols, but it can't reduce amides. BH3, on the other hand, is typically used in hydroboration reactions, adding to double bonds. But in this question, both are being used with H+, perhaps in a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product is a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is tetrahydro, which suggests it's a partially saturated ring—maybe a five-membered ring with one double bond? No, tetrahydro usually refers to four single bonds, so it must be a six-membered ring with one oxygen and two double bonds? Or maybe it's a fully saturated ring, making it a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one: the pyran part is a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a furan but six-membered). The 2H indicates that there's a double bond. So it has one double bond, making it a five-membered ring? Or perhaps it's a six-membered ring with one double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring (pyran is six-membered), with one oxygen. The 2H indicates that there's a double bond adjacent to the ketone. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with O at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and a double bond between positions 2 and 3, perhaps. And an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, but how does that form from a reduction? Maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group in a position that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a lactone. For example, a cyclic ester. When reduced, the ester is converted into a diol, but that doesn't form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. When the ester is reduced, it forms an alcohol, which could then form the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with an ester group. Reducing the ester would form an alcohol, which could then open the ring.

But I'm not getting much further. Let's try a different approach. The starting materials are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with either R or S configuration.

So the molecule is a pentanoic acid with substituents at carbon 3 (ethyl) and carbon 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups). The configuration is either R or S.

The reaction is with LiBH4 and H+ for compound A, and BH3 and H+ for compound B. The products are enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or something else, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, but the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives. So perhaps the reaction is converting the acid into something else.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a beta-keto ester. For example, the structure would be something like CH2-COO-R attached to a carbonyl group. When reduced, this could form a diol, but again, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, which could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Reducing that with LiBH4 or BH3 could lead to the formation of a diol, which could then form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. Reducing the ester would form a diol, but how does that form the pyranone?

Wait, another approach: the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The starting material must have had the necessary atoms arranged in a way that upon reduction, the ring forms. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or another acetal that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction opens it up, leading to the ring formation.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options.

The options suggest that both A and B are the same compound, either both R or S, or one R and the other S.

So if A and B are different enantiomers, then treating them with different reagents would give different products. But in this case, the products are enantiomers of each other.

Wait, so the starting materials are enantiomers. When each is treated with a different reducing agent, the product is each enantiomer of the same ketone.

Wait, but why would the same starting material, when treated with different reagents, give different products? Or is it that the different starting materials (enantiomers) give different products when treated with different reagents?

Wait, no. Let's think: if the starting materials are enantiomers, A and B are mirror images of each other. Each is treated with a different reducing agent. Depending on the reducing agent's approach, the product's configuration could vary.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reduction, the product is a secondary alcohol. But in our case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps this is a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent. When reduced, the ester group becomes an alcohol, and the substituent forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a keto ester. For example, the structure would have a carbonyl group and an ester group. When the ester is reduced, it becomes an alcohol, leading to ring formation.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, something like CH2CH2CO-O-R. When the ester is reduced, it forms a diol, which could then form a ring upon elimination to form the pyranone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, which upon reduction of the ester forms an alcohol, leading to ring formation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The starting materials are enantiomers (A and B are different R/S), so when each is treated with a different reducing agent, perhaps the approach of the reducing agent leads to different configurations in the product.

Wait, but for a ketone reduction, the product is a secondary alcohol, and the configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. However, in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So perhaps the reaction is not a reduction of a ketone but something else, like an epoxide opening.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. When you reduce an epoxide with a reagent like BH3, which is a Lewis acid, it can open the epoxide in a specific way, leading to a diol with certain stereochemistry. But then, how does that produce a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. When reduced, the carbonyl is converted to an alcohol, and the ring remains.

But I'm not getting closer. Let me think about the options again.

The options are all about the configuration of the starting materials. Option D says A is R and B is S. So if A is R and treated with LiBH4, it produces R product, and B is S and treated with BH3, it produces S product.

Wait, but why would the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration if the reaction doesn't involve any new stereocenters?

Hmm, perhaps the starting material has a stereocenter that affects the approach of the reducing agent, leading to different configurations in the product.

Wait, but in a simple ketone reduction, the product is a secondary alcohol, which would have a new stereocenter if the ketone wasn't already part of a chiral environment. So if the starting material is a chiral ketone, the reduction could lead to a diastereomer or another chiral center.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. So perhaps the reaction isn't a ketone reduction but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. When the ester is reduced, it becomes a diol, which could then form the pyranone through some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. When the ester is reduced, it forms an alcohol, leading to ring formation.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with a ketone. When reduced, it could form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, amides, ketones, and aldehydes. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds to double bonds.

Wait, in this problem, the products are ketones, so perhaps the starting materials are esters or something else that upon reduction form ketones. Hmm.

Wait, no, the product is a ketone, same as the starting material? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the starting material is an ester that upon reduction forms a ketone. But that would require breaking the ester into a ketone, which I don't think LiBH4 does. LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols.

Wait, unless the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent carbonyl group. Reducing the ester would form a diol, but then maybe the diol loses a water molecule to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When the ester is reduced, the beta-keto group could cyclize to form the ring.

Wait, but how?

For example, if you have a beta-keto ester like CH2-CO-COO-R. Reducing the ester group would give CH2-CO-CH2-OH. Then, under certain conditions, this could cyclize to form a ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester. Reducing the ester would form a beta-hydroxy ketone, which could then undergo intramolecular dehydration to form the pyranone.

Hmm, that makes more sense. So, if the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester, reducing the ester would form a beta-hydroxy ketone, which could lose water to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's plausible. So the starting material would be a cyclic beta-keto ester. Upon reduction with a hydride agent, the ester is converted to a hydroxyl group, forming a beta-hydroxy ketone. Then, under acidic conditions, it loses water to form the cyclic pyranone.

So, the stereochemistry of the starting material's hydroxyl group would influence the configuration of the final product.

In this case, the starting material would have a chiral center adjacent to the ester group. The configuration (R or S) of that center would dictate the configuration of the product.

Now, the reducing agents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. How would they affect the product's configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically provides the hydride in a way that leads to the most stable transition state, perhaps leading to the major product. BH3 might approach from a different face, leading to the opposite configuration.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the choice of reducing agent affects the stereochemistry of the reduction.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a cyclic beta-keto ester, the reduction of the ester group would form a diastereomer depending on the reducing agent. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents affect the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations in the product.

Wait, so if the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester with a specific configuration (R or S), and it's treated with LiBH4, which maybe approaches from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration in the product. Similarly, treating with BH3 might approach from the other side, leading to the opposite configuration.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, it produces the R product, and B is S and treated with BH3, it produces the S product.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So if A (R) with LiBH4 gives R product, and B (S) with BH3 gives S product, then option D would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reagent determine the product's configuration.

Wait, another possibility: when the ester is reduced, the configuration of the new stereocenter (from the reduction) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

In a cyclic beta-keto ester, the ester is part of a ring. The ester oxygen is adjacent to the ketone. When the ester is reduced, the oxygen becomes an alcohol group. The configuration of this new hydroxyl group would depend on the approach of the hydride.

If the starting material is R configuration, the hydride from LiBH4 approaches from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Similarly, with BH3, which is a weaker reducing agent, perhaps it approaches from the opposite face, leading to the opposite configuration.

So if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would give R product, and BH3 would give S product. But in the question, the product is (R) from A and (S) from B. So if A is R and B is S, then the products would be R and S.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

Suppose the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester with configuration R. When reduced with LiBH4, the hydride approaches from the top face, leading to the product with R configuration. When the same starting material is reduced with BH3, perhaps the hydride approaches from the bottom face, leading to S configuration.

But in the problem statement, the two starting materials are different enantiomers. So A is R and B is S.

When A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it produces (R)-product.

When B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces (S)-product.

So the correct option would be D: A is R, B is S.

Looking at the options, option D is "A = (R)-3-ethyl..., B = (S)-3-ethyl..." So that fits.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomers of (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are enantiomers of (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), and the stereochemistry of the products depends on both the starting material and the reducing agent.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - The product is a cyclic ketone, (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), which suggests the starting material must have a structure that can form this product upon reduction.  
   - The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups). The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) influences the stereochemistry of the product.

2. **Role of Reducing Agents**:  
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters or carbonyl groups to alcohols.  
   - BH3, while also a reducing agent, can approach the carbonyl group from a different face compared to LiBH4, leading to different stereochemical outcomes.  

3. **Stereochemical Considerations**:  
   - The starting materials are enantiomers (A and B have opposite configurations, R and S).  
   - The configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent determine the stereochemistry of the product.  
   - If the starting material is R and treated with LiBH4, the product will be R. If the starting material is S and treated with BH3, the product will be S.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are S. This would result in the same product configuration for both reactions, which contradicts the problem statement.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are R. Similar to Option A, this would result in the same product configuration for both reactions, which is incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: A is S and B is R. This would produce opposite stereochemical outcomes for the products, but it does not align with the expected stereochemical influence of the reducing agents.  
   - **Option D**: A is R and B is S. This matches the expected stereochemical outcomes: A (R) with LiBH4 produces (R)-product, and B (S) with BH3 produces (S)-product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B, as they produce the correct enantiomeric products based on the reducing agents used.

**Answer: D**
