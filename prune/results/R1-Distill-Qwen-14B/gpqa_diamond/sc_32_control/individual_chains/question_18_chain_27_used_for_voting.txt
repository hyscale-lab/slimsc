Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The question is more about their elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And for the Sun's photosphere:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. Wait, 12 is added. So, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg:
12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5) ≈ 1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe is about 3.16e-5 times the hydrogen density, and Mg is 1e-5 times.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Wait, no, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2). But since [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H), and if the stars are assumed to have the same H abundance as the Sun, which [Fe/H]_1 is 0, implying that [H]_1 is same as the Sun. Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so same H as Sun. So n_H is same in both stars as in the Sun. Therefore, the ratio of Si is (n_Si1) / (n_Si2) = [Si]_1 - [Si]_2.

But wait, the problem says to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] for Star_1, and [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2 for Star_2.

Let me break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance same as H. So Fe/H = 1 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as solar, which is 3.16e-5.

- [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) =0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So n_Si1 = 2 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 is same as solar Fe, which is 3.16e-5 * n_H. But wait, since [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → Wait, but in the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe_sun = n_Fe_sun_H.

But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of the Sun's values. Since both stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as 0, their Fe and Mg are solar.

Wait, let me think. For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = same as Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

So for Star_1:
n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) → but since [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) → but since [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → so n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). But n_H1 is same as n_H_sun because [Fe/H] is 0, right? Or is [Fe/H] the logarithm of (Fe/H ratio relative to the Sun)?

Wait, [X/H] is defined as log(n_X / n_H) - log(n_X_sun / n_H_sun) → which is log(n_X / n_H / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun)) ) → which is log( (n_X/n_H) / (n_X_sun/n_H_sun) ) → so [X/H] = 0 means same as solar.

So for Star_1, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) → but since [Fe/H] =0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). But [Fe/H] =0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → so if the star has the same H as the Sun, which it does because [Fe/H] is 0 (so Fe is same as Sun, so H is same, as [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H ratio relative to solar). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's treat all abundances in terms of log ratios.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) =0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe1 *10^0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe_sun *10^0.3 * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → but wait, n_Fe1 is n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H] is 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun).

Wait, but perhaps the H is the same in both the Sun and the star. Because for [Fe/H]_1 =0, [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H ratio relative to solar). So Fe is same as solar, H is same as solar. So n_H1 =n_H_sun. So n_Fe1 =n_Fe_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Si1 =n_Fe1 *10^0.3 =n_Fe_sun * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) =0.3 → n_Si2 = n_Mg2 *10^(-0.3).

Because [Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg/n_Si) → so log(n_Si/n_Mg) = -0.3 → n_Si = n_Mg *10^(-0.3).

So, n_Si2 =n_Mg_sun * 10^(-0.3).

Now, let's compute the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2.

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [ (n_Fe_sun *10^0.3) ] / [n_Mg_sun *10^(-0.3)] )

Wait, substituting the values:

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

n_Mg_sun=1e-5 *n_H_sun.

Wait, let me compute the ratio:

n_Si1 = n_Fe_sun *10^0.3 → 3.16e-5 *10^0.3 → 3.16e-5 * approx 2 → 6.32e-5.

n_Si2 =n_Mg_sun *10^(-0.3) → 1e-5 * 0.5 → 5e-6.

So the ratio is n_Si1 /n_Si2 = (6.32e-5) / (5e-6) ) → 6.32e-5 / 5e-6 = approx 12.64.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

10^0.3 is approximately 2. So n_Si1 = 3.16e-5 * 2 = 6.32e-5.

10^(-0.3) is 1/(10^0.3) ≈ 0.5.

n_Si2 =1e-5 *0.5 =5e-6.

So 6.32e-5 /5e-6 = (6.32e-5) / (5e-6 ) = (6.32 /5 ) * (1e-5/1e-6 )= (1.264) *10=12.64.

So approximately 12.6, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 → which is log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) =0.3 → n_Si2 =n_Mg2 *10^(-0.3). Correct.

n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun because [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So n_Si2 =n_Mg_sun *10^(-0.3).

n_Si1 =n_Fe1 *10^0.3. But n_Fe1 =n_Fe_sun because [Fe/H]=0.

So n_Si1 =n_Fe_sun *10^0.3.

So the ratio is n_Fe_sun *10^0.3 / (n_Mg_sun *10^(-0.3)).

= (n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun) * 10^(0.3 + 0.3) 

= (3.16e-5 /1e-5 ) *10^0.6 → 

3.16e-5 /1e-5 =3.16.

10^0.6 is about 3.98 (since 10^0.61 is about 4, 0.6 is around 3.98).

So 3.16 *3.98 ≈ approx 12.56, which is around 12.6.

So the ratio is about 12.6, so answer B.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}}) = 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) = 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{Mg2}} = 10^{-0.3} \approx 0.5 \).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{-5} \approx 1 \times 10^{-5} \).

### Calculations:
1. **Star_1**:
   - \( n_{\text{Si1}} = n_{\text{Fe1}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
   - Since \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \), and \( n_{\text{Fe, sun}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \), \( n_{\text{Si1}} = (3.16 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 2 = 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - \( n_{\text{Si2}} = n_{\text{Mg2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3} \).
   - Since \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \), and \( n_{\text{Mg, sun}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \), \( n_{\text{Si2}} = (1 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.5 = 5 \times 10^{-6} \).

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   - \( \text{Ratio} = n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Si2}} = (6.32 \times 10^{-5}) / (5 \times 10^{-6}) = 12.64 \).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
