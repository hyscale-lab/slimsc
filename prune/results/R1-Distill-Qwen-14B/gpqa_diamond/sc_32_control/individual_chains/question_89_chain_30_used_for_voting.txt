Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what each product is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the molecule is quite rigid. 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) likely leads to an elimination reaction. Since it's dibromide, when treated with a base, it might undergo dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is probably reacting in a way to form a double bond. Wait, there's another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Brs) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. So product 1 would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The 1H NMR of product 1 is given. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would give an alkene, but where's the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Another possibility is that heating with KOH could cause a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but if the product has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, an epoxide's IR would have a peak around 1250 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But how?

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with KOH, especially in a vicinal fashion (adjacent dihalide), elimination occurs to form a double bond. But if the dihalide is on a bridge structure, maybe the elimination leads to a more strained structure? Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening or some other reaction.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the product after KOH treatment is a ketone. How?

Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, similar to a Diels-Alder reaction, but more likely a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but if the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed (Bredt's rule). So perhaps the product is a diradical intermediate, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH could do a substitution, but if it's a dihalide, substitution would replace both Br atoms with hydroxide groups. Would that form an alcohol? But wait, the IR here is a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone. So substitution isn't the case. So maybe elimination leading to a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, followed by another reaction. Wait, but the product's IR has a strong carbonyl. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the starting material. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, perhaps undergoes a double elimination, forming a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some keto-enol tautomerism? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH to form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide would have an O in the structure, but the initial reaction is with KOH, which would likely form an alcohol or an oxide. Wait, but the IR is a carbonyl, so maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester? But no, because the starting material is a dihalide, and treating with KOH would form an alcohol, not an ester.

Wait, maybe it's a diketone? But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Let me think again about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. For a ketone, the NMR would not have protons near 4.79, unless perhaps it's an enol or something.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is around where you'd expect protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's an ether, but again, not sure. Alternatively, it might be a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. Let's think about the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on carbons 1 and 3, which are adjacent bridgeheads. Upon elimination, perhaps two HBr molecules are removed, forming a double bond. But since the carbons are bridgeheads, the double bond would be constrained, leading to a strained structure. But this again doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the KOH is not just eliminating. Maybe it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to formation of a ketone. Wait, if each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then the O's are oxidized? But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in such a way that each Br is substituted by an OH, forming a diol. But that would mean the product would have OH groups, which would appear as broad peaks in the NMR. The given NMR doesn't show such peaks. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a carbonyl, which is absent in the starting material. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How can KOH induce that?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but that would typically replace one Br with an OH group, not form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base induces a elimination to form an alkene, but then the alkene undergoes some kind of ring-opening to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the product is a strained cyclopropane, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, forming a bridgehead ketone. Wait, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, but bridgehead ketones are possible. So if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, perhaps the structure becomes a ketone at the bridgehead.

Wait, but how? Let's imagine. Each Br is on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between those two carbons, but that's a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group instead. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe an -OCH2O- group, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

The 2.41-2.23 region is a multiplet for 10H, which is a lot of protons. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead has two CH2 groups. So 10H maybe as CH2 groups in a rigid structure.

The 1.94 ppm is another 2H, maybe a CH2 group in a different environment.

Wait, putting this together: product 1 has a carbonyl group (from IR), so maybe it's a ketone. The NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79, which is a bit high field for a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Alternatively, it's an OCH2 group, but then why a singlet? Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, another thought. What if product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as a triplet or something. But in this case, 4.79 is a singlet for 2H.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but the NMR doesn't show broad peaks, which diols typically do. So that might not be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether. But again, the NMR doesn't align perfectly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction. KOH (a strong base) heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe it's an E2 elimination to form a double bond. But then, how does that produce a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. If the dihalide reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming 1,3-diol. But then, the IR would show O-H stretching, which would be a broad peak around 3300 cm^-1. The given IR is at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl, not an O-H.

So substitution doesn't seem to fit. So maybe elimination is the right path.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is an enol ether. But I'm not sure how that would form from this reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some kind of elimination followed by ring contraction or expansion. For example, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, perhaps forming a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a bridgehead ketone. Let's imagine: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH could deprotonate and eliminate HBr twice, forming a bridgehead double bond, but as I thought earlier, that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a ketone by some mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a case of adjacent dihalide elimination leading to a ketone. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination of both could lead to a carbonyl. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps via a mechanism where two E2 eliminations occur, each removing an H and a Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, two HBr molecules are eliminated, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, forming a double bond between them. But if the starting structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, then the elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the elimination doesn't form a double bond but a carbonyl. How? Perhaps via some kind of pericyclic reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about product 2, which is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone, and heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of enol ether formation or a Claisen rearrangement.

Wait, the Claisen rearrangement requires a ketene or an allyl vinyl ether. Alternatively, if product 1 is a dienone, perhaps a pinacol rearrangement could happen. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and heating with Al isopropoxide could cause some ring-opening or cyclization.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of a carbonyl in product 1 suggests that product 2 might be an enol ether or an acetal. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed by some kind of condensation reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the first two steps. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, which is a typical condition for ozonolysis. Then dimethyl sulfide is added, which is a reductive work-up, leading to breaking of ozonides into carbonyl groups.

So product 3 would be the result of breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond, which is cleaved by ozonolysis.

Putting it all together: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is a diepoxide or a diketone.

Wait, let's try to outline possible structures.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl) → product 2 (with double bond) → product 3 (after ozonolysis).

So, product 1 has a carbonyl, product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, what if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an alkene adjacent to the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction is elimination to form a double bond, but product 1 has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial product is a diene or some conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon heating with Al isopropoxide undergoes some rearrangement, perhaps a pinacol-like rearrangement, to form a diene.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is a diene formed via some pericyclic reaction.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton (excluding those that exchange).

So, product 3 is the result of ozonolysis and work-up. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 was a diene, product 3 would be a diketone or dialdehyde.

But considering product 3's structure, the most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps the H is adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a specific coupling pattern.

Wait, but ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, the structure of product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the NMR would show the H's adjacent to them.

So, the most deshielded H would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups. Let's imagine that in product 3, there's a structure like (CH2)n-CO, where the CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The H's on the CH2 would be deshielded and show up downfield. Their coupling would depend on neighboring H's.

Wait, for example, in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H on the CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. So, each H would have coupling with the adjacent H on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but usually not observed in 1H NMR unless under specific conditions) and with adjacent groups.

Or perhaps the H's are in a more complex environment, like being part of a conjugated system or near branching.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H). If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a neighboring group, like a CH2O or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which would explain the singlet. Enol ethers have CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, which can appear as singlets if they're not split by neighboring H's.

Wait, but the singlet is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O.

But then, how does that fit with the initial reaction?

Wait, I'm starting to think that perhaps the initial product is an epoxide. But the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, which epoxide doesn't have. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the steps again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm^-1). So, product 1 is likely an epoxide, but no, because epoxide's IR is around 1250 cm^-1. Alternatively, it's a ketone. So maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation followed by keto-enol tautomerism? But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form an allene. An allene (cumulative diene) with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diradical, which then forms a carbonyl group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an acyl chloride, and the starting material is a dihalide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is acting as a base in a coupling reaction. For example, the Cope elimination, but that usually requires amines and forms alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a elimination-addition mechanism to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the dihalide, under basic conditions, forms a bis-alkoxide intermediate, which then loses H2O to form a carbonyl. But for that, the two Brs would need to be on adjacent carbons, which they are (1 and 3 on adamantane, which are adjacent?), so perhaps each elimination leads to loss of HBr and formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group, which then loses H2O and forms a carbonyl. So, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to an OH group, leading to formation of ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are lost, and two OH groups are formed, which then dehydrate to form a ketone.

Wait, but if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead. Upon treatment with KOH, each Br might be replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps each OH then loses a proton, leading to a double bond. But that brings us back to the alkene idea without the carbonyl.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for the answer from the options. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved into carbonyl groups. So product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. The H's adjacent to carbonyl groups are usually deshielded, so they appear downfield.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring H's. If a proton is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, etc., the splitting can be complex.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CO, then each H on CH2 would have coupling with the other H on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, usually not observed) and with adjacent groups. Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would have coupling with H's on adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is in a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something similar.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each H on the middle CH2 groups would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Each H would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have splitting from two neighboring groups.

Wait, more precisely, if a H is on a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups, each H would have coupling with the two H's on each adjacent CH2. So for each H, it would be coupled with two sets of H's. Let's say each adjacent CH2 has two H's, so each H would have (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the number of H's on each adjacent group.

Wait, but in reality, each H on the middle CH2 would be coupled with the two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H would be split into a triplet from one side and a triplet from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets depending on the coupling constants.

Wait, for example, if a H is next to two different sets of H's, each with different coupling constants, it can lead to more complex splitting. But if the coupling constants are similar, it might appear as a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, option D is pentet.

Another scenario: if a H is adjacent to a CH2 group which is next to another CH2 group, the H would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two H's. So the first coupling would split the H into a triplet (from the first adjacent CH2), and each of those would be split again into triplets by the second adjacent CH2. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

So that would be option B.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a CH with two H's, that would be a triplet, but if it's adjacent to two CH2 groups, it would be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the H is on a CH2 group next to a CH group. So the H would couple with the two H's on the same CH2 (maybe as a triplet) and with the H's on the adjacent CH. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH-CO, then each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH.

In that case, each H on CH2 would be a triplet (from coupling with the two H's on the same CH2) and perhaps a doublet from coupling with the H on the adjacent CH. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group next to two CH2 groups. Then each H would be a triplet from one side and another triplet from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: in ozonolysis of a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the break points. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, forming two ketones or aldehydes.

If product 2 is a conjugated diene, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The structure would be something like R-CO-R', where R and R' are the remaining parts from the diene.

Wait, but if product 3 has a structure with a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, that would have H's that are deshielded. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O-. Then, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have H's that are deshielded.

Each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups (each with two H's). So each H would couple with two neighboring sets of two H's.

Each coupling would split the peak. So for each H, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which would be a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is simpler. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2 group would have H's that are next to each other and the carbonyl.

Wait, the H's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to the CH2 on the other side. So each H would be next to two H's on the adjacent CH2.

So each H would be a triplet from one side and a triplet from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are in a more complex arrangement, leading to a pentet. But that would require four neighboring H's, which might not be the case here.

Another angle: the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group. So each H would have coupling with two H's on one side and two H's on the other. But this would lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H's are on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each H would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the number of neighboring H's.

In product 3, the H's adjacent to carbonyl groups would likely be in a structure like CH2-CO. So each H on the CH2 would be next to another H on the same CH2 (geminal, but usually not split), and perhaps next to a CH2 group on the other side of the carbonyl.

So each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2. Each of these would cause splitting. So each H would first split into a triplet (from the adjacent CH2), and then each of those would split again into triplets from another adjacent CH2.

Thus, the splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to two different sets of H's, each with a different coupling constant, leading to a doublet of triplets or vice versa.

But I'm more confident that the splitting would be a triplet of triplets in this scenario.

So, the answer would be B, triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating with KOH, which likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction forms a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could correspond to a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group, such as oxygen. The remaining peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) are consistent with the rigid adamantane structure.

Next, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves a rearrangement or reaction that introduces a double bond into the structure, as product 2 is subsequently subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis at -78°C cleaves double bonds, and the subsequent addition of dimethyl sulfide leads to the formation of product 3, which contains carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen atoms are those adjacent to carbonyl groups. These hydrogens are likely part of a CH₂ group flanked by carbonyl groups. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a splitting pattern where each hydrogen is first split into a triplet by one adjacent CH₂ group, and each of these triplets is further split into another triplet by the second adjacent CH₂ group. The overall coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is therefore a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
