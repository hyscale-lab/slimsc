Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I'll have to consider how relativity affects the speed. Oh right, in relativity, as objects move faster, their mass increases, or something like that. But wait, mass is invariant, right? Oh yeah, it's the relativistic mass that increases with velocity.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, these are equal, so (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m) = (kA)/sqrt(m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The options have some with c, so this must be a relativistic scenario.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; there's also rest mass energy. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but since it's a 1D case, I think the total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential, just like in classical mechanics. But wait, in quantum mechanics, energy levels are quantized, but here it's a classical oscillator, so maybe it's treated classically, but with relativistic speeds.

Wait, but the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the force is F = -kx, but when considering the equations of motion relativistically, the equation might change. I think the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated. Let me think. Normally, the equation is m d²x/dt² = -kx, but relativistically, the mass becomes gamma m, so maybe the equation involves gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy approach is better. In the non-relativistic case, at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is zero. As the mass moves towards the equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic. At maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is more than just (1/2)mv², because the kinetic energy formula is (gamma - 1)mc².

So the total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the potential energy (1/2)kA² and the rest mass energy mc². Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be (gamma -1) mc², and the potential energy is the same?

Wait, no. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², which depends on x. But when x is A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy? Or does the rest mass energy not change? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², right? Because when the mass is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum and the kinetic is zero. So in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is higher because KE = (gamma -1) mc².

So the total energy E must be (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy? Or is the total energy just (1/2)kA², assuming E is the sum of kinetic and potential? Hmm. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the maximum kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². But in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. As the oscillator moves, potential energy decreases and kinetic increases.

At the point of maximum speed, the potential energy is zero and all the energy is kinetic. Wait, no, that can't be right because the potential energy at x=0 is zero. So in that case, the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. But in relativity, energy includes rest mass energy. So perhaps the total energy is actually higher.

Wait, let's think again. The problem is a bit ambiguous. If the oscillator is subject to F = -kx, and it's a relativistic oscillator, then perhaps the total energy (kinetic plus potential) plus rest mass energy is conserved. Alternatively, maybe the energy considered here is the mechanical energy, including relativistic corrections.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic form for the kinetic energy. Let me think. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + KE. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

At maximum displacement x=A, potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at that point is (1/2)kA² + mc².

At maximum speed, x=0, so potential energy is zero. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and this must be equal to the total energy, which is (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, but let me write this out:

At x=A: potential = (1/2)kA²; kinetic = 0. Total energy E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x=0: potential = 0; kinetic = (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc² → (gamma -1) = (1/2)(kA²)/(mc²) + 1 → gamma = (1/2)(kA²)/(mc²) + 2. That seems a bit off, but maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is just the mechanical energy, including relativistic kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy is part of the total energy, including rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved, but in relativity, the expressions are different. Or perhaps the problem is using a relativistic correction to the force equation.

Wait, another approach. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is different. The usual Newtonian equation is m d²x/dt² = -kx. But relativistically, the mass increases due to gamma, so the equation becomes gamma m d²x/dt² = -kx. Wait, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy approach. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. Wait, no, the rest mass energy is mc², which is separate from the mechanical energy. So in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy and the maximum kinetic energy when x=0.

But in the relativistic case, when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy must equal the total mechanical energy, which is (1/2)kA². So at x=A, KE=0, PE=(1/2)kA². At x=0, PE=0, KE = (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, that seems more plausible. So:

At x=A: KE = 0, PE = (1/2)kA². So the mechanical energy E = (1/2)kA².

At x=0: PE = 0, KE = (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me define (kA²)/(2 mc²) as a variable, say, beta. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

But beta is (kA²)/(2 mc²). Hmm. Now, I need to solve for v.

Let me write this equation:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) = [2 mc² + kA² ] / (2 mc²).

Wait, but solving for v from gamma is tricky. Let me square both sides:

gamma² = [1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²)]².

But gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²)]².

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 mc²) as a for simplicity.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 +a)^2.

Which is,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 +a)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 +a)^2:

1 - 1/(1 +a)^2 = [ (1 +a)^2 -1 ] / (1 +a)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a +a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² (2a + a²) / (1 +a)^2.

But a is (kA²)/(2 mc²), so substituting a back in:

v² = c² [ 2*(kA²/(2 mc²)) + (kA²/(2 mc²))² ] / [1 + (kA²/(2 mc²))]^2.

Let me compute numerator:

2*a = 2*(kA²/(2 mc²)) )= (kA²)/(mc²).

a² = (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is (1 + a)^2 = [ (2 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ]^2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor:

Numerator becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4).

Wait, perhaps factoring (k A²)/(2 m c²):

Numerator = (kA²/(2 m c²)) [ 2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ].

Wait, let me compute each part:

Numerator of v²:

[ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] = (k A²)/(4 m² c^4) [ 4 m c² + k A^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I should factor out (kA²/(2 mc²)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the numerator as follows:

(k A²/(m c²)) [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Hmm, because:

(k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) = (k A²/(m c²)) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Yes, that's correct.

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The (1 + kA²/(2 m c^2) ) terms cancel one in the numerator and denominator.

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ) ].

Simplify:

v² = (c²) * (k A²/(m c²)) ) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

The c² cancels in numerator:

v² = (k A²/m) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Factor denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 m c^2:

v² = [ (k A²/m) * 2 m c² ] / [ 2 m c² + k A^2 ].

The m cancels:

v² = (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

So,

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² + k A²) ) )

Factor numerator and denominator:

We can factor numerator as 2 c² k A²

Denominator: c² (2 m) + k A².

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write denominator as 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

So,

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] )) )

Cancel 2 m c^2 from numerator and denominator:

v = sqrt( (k A^2) / ( m [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] ) )

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me write v as:

v = sqrt( (k A^2) / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] )

But looking at the options, perhaps I can relate this expression to the options. Let me look at the options:

Option C is v_max = sqrt(k A^2/m), which is the non-relativistic case. So this isn't the correct answer because we're in the relativistic scenario.

Looking at the other options, they involve c and square roots. Let me try to manipulate my expression further.

Let me write the denominator inside the square root as:

m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) = m + (k A^2)/(2 c^2).

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2) / ( m + (k A^2)/(2 c^2) ) )

Hmm. Let me factor out m from denominator:

= sqrt( (k A^2) / [ m ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] )

= sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ) * sqrt( 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m) ) * sqrt( 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

Which is,

v = v_nonrelativistic * sqrt( 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

But v_nonrelativistic is sqrt( k A^2/m ) as in option C.

Wait, but the options don't have this form. Let me see the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2m))^2 )

Not sure. Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2 m c²) )).

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate my expression to get it into terms of c and square roots.

Wait, I have:

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

Let me factor out denominator as c² (something):

Denominator: 2 m c² + k A^2 = c² [ 2 m + (k A^2)/c² ].

Not sure.

Alternatively, let me write the denominator as:

Denominator = 2 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2 m c^2 [ 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ) ) ]

So,

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / ( 2 m c^2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/( 2 m c^2 ) ] ) )

The 2 m c^2 cancels:

v = sqrt( (k A² c²) / ( m c² [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ] ) )

Wait, no. Wait,

Wait, numerator is 2 k A² c², denominator is 2 m c² + k A^2 = 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ).

So,

v = sqrt( [ 2 k A² c² ] / [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The 2 m c² in numerator and denominator cancel, so:

v = sqrt( (k A^2) / ( m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) )

= sqrt( (k A^2/(m) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, but I'm not getting any closer to the options. Let me think differently. Maybe I can express this in terms of the Lorentz factor.

Earlier, I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, gamma = 1 + [k A²]/(2 m c² )

Expressed as:

gamma = [ 2 m c^2 + k A² ] / (2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Let me take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4 ) / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - 4 m² c^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Expand numerator:

(2 m c^2)^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2) + (k A^2)^2 - 4 m² c^4.

Which is:

4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4.

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel, so:

= 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Factor:

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v²/c² = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, numerator in v²/c² is [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps we can write numerator as:

k A^2 ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2*2 m c^2 * k A^2 ?

Wait, 4 m c^2 is 2*2 m c^2, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2, which is (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Numerator is ( a * (4 m c² + a ) ), where a = k A².

Wait, not sure. Let's try plugging in terms.

Hmm, maybe it's better to go back to the expression I had earlier for v:

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Let me factor 2 m c^2 from numerator and denominator:

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c^2) / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ] )

Simplify:

= sqrt( (k A^2) / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) * sqrt( 2/(2) )

Wait, sqrt( 2/(2) ) is 1, so that's just sqrt( (k A^2)/(m ( ... ) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ) * sqrt( 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ] )

Which is,

v = v_nonrelativistic * sqrt( 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

But I need to express this in terms of c. Let me think about the options. Let's look at option B:

B) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

No, that doesn't seem to match. Option D:

D) v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ]

Earlier, I had:

v²/c² = [ 2 a (1 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, from earlier steps, I had:

v² = [ (2 k A² c²) ] / [ 2 m c² + k A^2 ]

Let me factor denominator as [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ]

So,

v² = [ 2 k A² c² ] / [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [ (k A^2) ] / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not seeing the connection to the options. Let's try to manipulate the options to see which one matches.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - x)^2 ), where x = kA²/(2m )

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - x/c² ) ), where x is kA²/(2m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma.

Another approach: Let me write the expression for v as:

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

This can be rewritten as:

v = c * sqrt( (2 k A² ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator by 2 m c²:

= c * sqrt( (2 k A² ) / [ 2 m c² ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2) / ( m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) )

= c * [ sqrt(k A^2/( m c^2 )) ] / sqrt(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= c * [ (A sqrt(k/m) ) / (c sqrt(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) ) ]

Wait, that might not help. Hmm.

Alternatively, factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ):

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as y.

Then, the expression for v becomes:

v = c * sqrt( 2 y ) / (1 + y )

Wait, let me see:

Because,

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c²) / (2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

= sqrt( [2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) c^2 * 2 m c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + y ) ] )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in terms of y, where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), then 2 m c^2 = (k A^2 )/(y )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:

y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

k A^2 = 2 m c^2 y

Then,

v = sqrt( (2 * 2 m c^2 y * c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 y ) )

= sqrt( (4 m c^4 y ) / (2 m c^2 (1 + y) ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 m c^4 y / (2 m c^2 (1 + y) ) ) = 2 c² y / (1 + y )

So,

v = sqrt( 2 c² y / (1 + y) )

= c sqrt( 2 y / (1 + y) )

Substituting y back:

y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Simplify numerator inside the sqrt:

2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = (k A^2)/(m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Hmm, this is the same expression I had earlier. It's not matching any of the options, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the total energy. In the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc², not just (1/2)kA². Let me try that again.

At x=A: PE = (1/2)k A², KE = 0. So E = PE + KE + mc² → (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of KE and PE. But in the relativistic case, the KE is (gamma -1) mc², so the total mechanical energy would be (gamma) mc². Hmm, perhaps I need to model it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the mechanical energy (excluding rest mass) is conserved. So the sum of KE and PE is conserved, and equals (1/2)kA².

So, at x=A: KE=0, PE=(1/2)kA².

At x=0: KE=(gamma-1) mc², PE=0.

So,

(gamma -1 ) mc² = (1/2)kA²

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² )

That's the same as before. So same steps.

So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I should compare each option's expression to this.

Option C is just the non-relativistic case, so it's probably not correct.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a^2 ), where a = (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 - 1/(1 + a² ) = ( (1 + a² ) - 1 ) / (1 + a² ) ) = a²/(1 + a² )

So,

v in option D would be c * sqrt( a²/(1 + a² ) ) = c a / sqrt(1 + a² )

But from earlier, I have v = c sqrt( (2 a) / (1 + a) )

Wait, perhaps not matching.

Alternatively, let me compute the expressions.

Another approach: Let me compute v_max from my expression and see which option matches.

From earlier, I had:

v_max = sqrt( (2 k A² c² ) / (2 m c² + k A² ) )

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2 m c²:

v_max = sqrt( (2 k A² c² ) / (2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the denominator as (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

Wait, perhaps I can express this as:

v_max = sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m + (k A^2)/(2 c^2 )) )

Which is,

v_max = sqrt( (k A^2 ) / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 c^2) ) )

= sqrt( (2 k A^2 c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, maybe I should look for an option that simplifies to this expression.

Looking at option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

1 + 1/(1 - x ) = (1 - x +1 )/(1 - x ) = (2 - x)/(1 -x )

So, option B becomes c * sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 -x ) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - x )^2 ), where x = kA^2/(2m )

Hmm, that's different.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 = (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )²

So,

sqrt( (2x + x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) ) = sqrt( x(2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Not sure.

Wait, my expression is:

v = c * sqrt( [ 2 k A^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] )

Hmm. Let me write this as:

v = c * sqrt( 2 y / (2 m c^2 (1 + y ) ) ), where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 y )/(2 m c^2 (1 + y )) )

= c * sqrt( y / ( m c^2 (1 + y ) ) )

But y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) / ( m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 ) / ( 2 m^2 c^4 ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2 ) / ( 2 m^2 c^4 ( ... ) ) )

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as v = c * sqrt( (something) )

Wait, from earlier, I had:

v = c * sqrt( 2 a c^2 (1 + a )^{-1} ), where a = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, not sure.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A would be correct. Let me evaluate option A's expression.

Option A: v = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m) )^2 ) )

Wait, is that even correct dimensionally? Because (kA^2/(2m) ) has dimensions of (N m² )/( kg ) → (kg·m/s² · m² )/(kg ) → m^3/s². But (1 - x ) needs to be dimensionless, so this seems incorrect. So probably option A is not correct.

Similarly, option B: 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

But (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) is dimensionless, so that's okay.

Wait, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - x) where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

1 + 1/(1 -x ) = [ (1 -x) + 1 ] / (1 - x ) ) = (2 - x)/(1 -x )

So,

sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 -x ) ) = sqrt( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) ) → but this would require that 2 m c^2 > k A^2, which isn't necessarily the case.

Hmm.

Wait, is there any way to match my expression with the given options?

From my calculations, the correct expression is v = sqrt( (2 k A² c² )/(2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

Let me factor numerator and denominator by c²:

= sqrt( (2 k A² )/(2 m + (k A^2 )/c² ) )

Wait, that's sqrt( 2 k A² / [ 2 m + (k A^2)/c² ] )

Hmm. Now, let me multiply numerator and denominator by c²:

= sqrt( (2 k A² c² ) / ( 2 m c² + k A^2 ) )

Which brings me back to where I started.

I think perhaps I need to consider that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial energy consideration.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator might not be (1/2)k x², but perhaps it's modified. But I think in this problem, the force is given as F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)k x², as in classical mechanics.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the force equation for a relativistic oscillator is different.

The relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is:

d/dt ( gamma m v ) = -k x.

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so this becomes a complicated differential equation. Solving this might not be straightforward, but perhaps at maximum displacement (x=A, v=0), the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the total energy (including rest mass) is E = gamma m c².

Wait, but at x=A, v=0, so gamma = 1, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Then, when the oscillator moves to x=0, all the potential is converted into kinetic plus the rest energy. So,

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Thus,

gamma = 1 + (1/2)k A²/(m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

So from gamma, v can be found as:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me call (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ) as y for simplicity.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + y.

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (1 + y )^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + y )^2.

Thus,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2.

= [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2.

Expanding numerator:

1 + 2y + y^2 -1 = 2y + y^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2.

= y(2 + y )/(1 + y )^2.

Now, y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( y(2 + y ) )/(1 + y )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Simplify inside the sqrt:

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 ) ) / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, the denominator after the sqrt is (1 + y ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

The (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) terms cancel:

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^(1/2 )

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the final expression for v as:

v = c * sqrt( (2 y ) / (1 + y ) )

Where y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) / ( 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c^2 (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m ( c^2 + (k A^2 )/(2 )) ) )

Hmm.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D is correct.

Option D: v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ]

Which is,

= [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2

= (1 + 2y + y^2 -1 ) / (1 + y )^2

= (2y + y^2 ) / (1 + y )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) / (1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Hmm, but this isn't matching what I have.

Wait, from earlier, I have:

v^2 = (2 k A^2 c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Which is (2 k A^2 c^2 ) / denominator.

Hmm.

I think I'm not seeing a clear path to match it with any of the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, this speed can't exceed c. So perhaps the correct option is the one that tends to option C when the relativistic terms are negligible.

Looking at option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

If (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) is very small, then 1/(1 - x ) ≈ 1 + x.

So,

v ≈ c sqrt(1 + (1 + x )) ) → sqrt(2 + x ), which isn't the same as option C.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

If (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) is small, then 1/(1 + x^2 ) ≈ 1 - x^2.

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 1 - (1 - x^2 ) ) = c sqrt( x^2 ) = c x = c*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )^(1/2 )

Wait, which is c*(k A/(sqrt(2 m c^2 )) ) = (k A )/(sqrt(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, not the same as non-relativistic case.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m ))^2 )

Again, if (k A^2/(2 m )) is small, denominator 1 -x^2 ~1, so v ~ c sqrt(2 ) → which is larger than non-rel.

But I'm not getting the right limit. Wait, but when the relativistic effects are small, the maximum speed should approach the non-relativistic value. So, for option C, v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which would be the non-rel limit.

But I have to find which of the options reduces to option C when the relativistic terms are negligible.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me look back at the options.

Option D, when the terms are small, the denominator (1 + x )^2 is approximately 1, so:

v_max ≈ c sqrt( 1 - 1 ) → 0, which is incorrect. So option D is not correct.

Option B: when x is small, 1/(1 -x ) ~ 1 +x, so:

v_max ≈ c sqrt( 2 +x )

Which doesn't match the non-rel limit. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option A: when x is small, (1 - x )^2 ~1, so sqrt(1 + 1 ) → sqrt(2 ), which is higher than non-rel. So not option A.

So perhaps none of the options correctly reduce to the non-rel limit, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the energy approach.

Wait, another possibility: The oscillator's total energy includes the rest mass energy. So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc². At x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1 ) mc², and potential is zero. So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²

Which gives:

gamma = 1 + (1/2)(k A²)/(m c² )

Wait, that's different from what I had before. Oh, because the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is mc², so the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc².

So,

gamma = ( (1/2)kA² + mc² )/(mc² )

Wait, no. Because, E_total = gamma mc².

E_total = (1/2)kA² + mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²

=> gamma = 1 + (1/2)(kA²)/(m c² )

Ah, earlier I had gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is the same as this.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Thus,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2

Thus,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, no, option D is written as:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what I have. So option D is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier steps, I had:

v^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ]

Which is,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 )

Where y = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation and relativistic corrections.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system includes the rest mass energy \( mc^2 \) and the mechanical energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]

   At maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \), the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately accounts for the relativistic corrections to the maximum speed of the harmonic oscillator.

Answer: D
