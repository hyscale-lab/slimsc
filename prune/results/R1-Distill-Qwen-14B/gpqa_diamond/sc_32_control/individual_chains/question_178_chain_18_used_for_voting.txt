Okay, so I've got this quantum field theory problem here, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which I think for electromagnetism would be something like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, but in a non-Abelian theory it's different. But I think for this problem, the exact form of F doesn't matter as much as its dimension.

So, the first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I'll need to look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, in 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Breaking down the Lagrangian term: it's κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part.

First, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because fermion fields in four dimensions typically have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2. Let me check: the Dirac equation is something like (i∂ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so each term in the operator must have the same dimension. So (i∂) has dimension 1, m is dimension 1 (since it's mass), so ψ must have dimension (1)/ (mass dimension of (i∂ - m)) on the left. Hmm, wait, no, the left-hand side is (i∂ - m) acting on ψ. The equation is operator times ψ equals zero. The operator has dimension (since ∂ is dimension 1, m is dimension 1), so operator is dimension 1. So ψ must have dimension (operator dimension) minus? Wait, no, wait. The equation is (i∂ - m) ψ = 0, so each term must have the same dimension. So (i∂) ψ has dimension (dimension of ∂) + dimension of ψ. Since ∂ is dim 1, and the left-hand side is dimensionless? No, wait, the equation is an operator equation, so all terms must have the same dimension. So (i∂) has dimension 1, so (i∂)ψ must have the same dimension as m ψ. So m is dimension 1, so m ψ has dimension [m][ψ] = 1 + [ψ]. On the other side, (i∂)ψ has dimension 1 + [ψ]. So 1 + [ψ] = 1 + [ψ]. That's a bit circular. Wait, perhaps another approach.

In QFT, the fields have specific mass dimensions based on their equations. For the Dirac field, the equation is iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ = 0. Each term must have the same dimension. The first term, iγ ∂ ψ, has dimension [∂] + [ψ] = 1 + [ψ]. The second term is m ψ, so [m] + [ψ] = 1 + [ψ] (since [m] is 1). So both terms are equal, so it works out. So ψ has dimension 3/2? Because let me see: the equation must have terms of same dimension. So if [iγ ∂ ψ] = [m ψ], then [∂][ψ] = [m][ψ]. Since [∂] is 1 and [m] is 1, this doesn't give new info. Hmm, maybe I should remember that in 4D, ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + (something from σ_{μν}?) Wait no, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless. Because the gamma matrices are part of the spinor representation and don't carry mass dimensions. So σ_{μν} is made of [γ_mu, γ_nu], which are both dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

Then we have F^{μν}. The field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a gauge field, which in 4D has dimension 1. Because the field strength F is dimension 2. Because F is made from derivatives of A, so [F] = [∂ A] = [1][1] = 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ ψ] [F]. So the dimension of the entire term must be 4 (since it's part of the Lagrangian). So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, [F] is 2. So 3 + 2 =5, and the Lagrangian term must be 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

So the first part of the question gives us that [κ] is -1, which would make option A or C. Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. The rule is that a coupling with dimension less than or equal to zero (in 4D) is renormalizable. Because if the dimension is positive, it's a nonrenormalizable interaction, which requires an infinite number of counterterms, so the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, wait. The general formula for the mass dimension of a coupling constant is [g] = 4 - (sum of fields dimensions in the term). So for an interaction term like g φ^n, the coupling dimension is [g] = 4 - n [φ]. If [g] ≥ 0, the interaction is renormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The fields are ψ (twice) and F. So let's figure out the sum of their dimensions.

Wait, ψ has dimension 3/2 each, so two ψ's contribute 3. F has dimension 2. So total fields dimension is 3 + 2 =5. So the coupling κ must have dimension [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. Which matches what we found earlier.

Now, for renormalizability: in 4D, a term is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension ≤ 0. Because each coupling can have at most a certain number of insertions in loops, and higher dimension couplings lead to worse divergences.

Wait, wait, no. Actually, the condition is that the coupling must have dimension ≤ (4 - (sum of external lines in the vertex)). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In general, in four dimensions, renormalizable theories have their coupling constants with positive mass dimensions? No, wait, the opposite. Let me recall: the dimension of the coupling is [g] = d - n [φ], where d=4, n is the number of fields in the interaction term.

Wait, for a term g φ^m, the coupling has dimension [g] = 4 - m [φ]. So for a scalar field φ with dimension 1 (since in 4D, [φ] = (4-2)/2 =1, because for a scalar field equation (∂^2 φ) ~ m^2 φ, so [∂]^2 [φ] = [m]^2 [φ]. ∂ is dimension 1, so [∂]^2 is 2. So 2 + [φ] = 2 + [φ] = [mass]^2 [φ], so [φ] must be [mass]^0, which is dimension 1? Wait, no, that gives [∂^2 φ] = [φ], which can't be right.

Wait, correction. The Klein-Gordon equation is (∂^2 - m^2)φ = 0. So the terms (∂^2 φ) and (m^2 φ) must have the same dimension. [∂^2 φ] = [∂]^2 [φ] = (1)^2 [φ] = [φ]. [m^2 φ] = [m]^2 [φ]. So [φ] must equal [m]^2 [φ], which can only hold if [m] is dimensionless. Wait, that's only possible if [m] is zero, but that's not the case. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, in 4D, the field φ has mass dimension 1. Because the action S = ∫ d^4 x (1/2) ∂φ ∂φ - (1/2) m^2 φ^2 must be dimensionless (dimension 0). Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, because the integral is dimensionless, so each term must have [term] = 4.

So (1/2) ∂φ ∂φ has [∂φ]^2 = (1 + [φ])^2. So [∂φ]^2 = [φ]^2 + 2 [φ] +1. So the term (∂φ)^2 has dimension [∂φ]^2 = (1 + [φ])^2 = 4, because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So:

(1 + [φ])^2 =4 → 1 + [φ] = 2 → [φ] =1.

So yes, the scalar field has dimension 1. Then for a term like g φ^m, [g] = 4 - m [φ] =4 - m*1 =4 -m.

For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, so 4 -m ≥0 → m ≤4.

So, for our problem, the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's count the number of fields: two ψ's and one F.

Wait, no. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is a spinor field, so two ψs (ψ̄ and ψ), and F is a field strength tensor. How many F's are there? Just one F^{μν}, I think. So the number of fields in the term is 2 (from ψ) + 1 (from F) = 3 fields. Wait, no, wait. ψ̄ is a spinor field, same as ψ: so two spinor fields. F is a field strength tensor, which is a tensor of rank 2. But in terms of field count, each F is considered as a single field. So the term has two spinors and one F, so three fields.

Each field's dimension: spinor has 3/2 each, F has 2.

So the sum of the fields' dimensions is 2*(3/2) + 2 = 3 +2 =5.

So the coupling κ must have dimension [κ] =4 - (sum of fields) =4 -5= -1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the general formula is [Lagrangian term] = [coupling] + sum of [fields] =4. So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ_{μν}] + [F^{μν}] =4.

Wait no, σ_{μν} is made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute to the dimension. So [σ] =0.

So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

[ψ̄] =3/2, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2.

So [κ] + 3/2 +3/2 +2 = [κ] + (3+2)= [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So yes, as before.

Now, renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the interactions have couplings with positive mass dimension (wait, no, in 4D, the coupling must have dimension ≤0 for renormalizability? Or ≥0? Wait, perhaps I should think about the superficial degree of divergence.

In a Feynman diagram, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D =4 - (L * [g]) - (I * (d/2)), where L is the number of loops, I the number of internal lines, and d the dimension. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the renormalizability is determined by the dimension of the coupling. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a mass dimension ≥0, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: in a renormalizable interaction, the coupling can only appear with positive mass dimension. Because in the interaction term, the coupling's dimension shouldn't require it to be multiplied by higher powers of momentum, which would lead to nonrenormalizable interactions.

Wait, I think the correct condition is that [g] ≥0 for renormalizable interactions. Because if [g] is negative, then the interaction term would have a dimension higher than 4, which can't be part of the Lagrangian. Wait, that's not right because the Lagrangian terms already have dimension 4. So perhaps I should think in terms of when you're writing the interaction terms, each term must have dimension 4. So the coupling must compensate for the dimensions of the fields.

But for renormalizability, the number of fields in the term can't be too high. In four dimensions, the maximum number of fields in a term is four, because each field has a certain dimension, and the coupling's dimension must be ≥0.

Wait, given that [g] must be ≥0. Because in the term g φ^m, [g] =4 - m [φ]. For scalar fields, [φ] =1, so [g] =4 - m. So if m=4, [g]=0. If m>4, [g] negative, which is nonrenormalizable.

In our case, the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The number of fields is 2 (ψ) +1 (F) =3 fields. Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2. So 2*(3/2) +2 =3+2=5. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the coupling has dimension -1, which is less than zero. Which implies that the interaction is nonrenormalizable. Because when [g] <0, the interaction is of higher dimension, leading to nonrenormalizable terms.

So the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it all together: [κ] = -1, theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the dimensions of the terms in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term, being a commutator of dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices, is dimensionless.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2 (as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension 1).

Thus, the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has total dimension:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right] + \left[\psi\right] + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
For the Lagrangian to have dimension 4, the coupling $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
\left[\kappa\right] + 5 = 4 \implies \left[\kappa\right] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
