Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental ratios, so maybe that's just extra info. The key here is the [X/Y] notations, which I remember are logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another element.

Let me list out what's given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, I need [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1]? Or wait, no. I think the problem wants (n_Si1 / n_Si2), the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me approach each star step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10(n_Si / n_Fe) = 0.3 → n_Si / n_Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

Wait no, actually, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh wait, no—actually, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) → equals log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X,n_sun / n_Y,n_sun) ) ) → which simplifies to log( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think about what [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 means. It means that compared to the Sun, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher by a factor of 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun)

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → so (n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun)

Because [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → 0 means n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But since in a star's atmosphere, the total number of hydrogen might vary, but in the solar case, n_H_sun is a given. Wait, but maybe it's better to express everything relative to hydrogen.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 → since [Fe/H]_1=0.

And from [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^0.3.

So substituting n_Fe1 from above:

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 * 10^0.3.

But I need to find n_Si1 and n_Si2, then take the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star, then find the ratio between the two stars.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 / n_H1 = (n_Si1) / (n_H1) = [n_Si1 / n_Fe1] * [n_Fe1 / n_H1]

n_Si1 / n_H1 = (10^0.3) * (n_Fe1 / n_H1).

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So n_Si1 / n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2.

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(n_Mg2 / n_Si2) = 0.3 → n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log10(n_Mg2 / n_H2) = 0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) ) * n_H2.

So from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^0.3.

But n_Mg2 is also (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Setting them equal:

n_Si2 * 10^0.3 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So n_Si2 = [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2 ] / 10^0.3.

Wait, but also, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, which is the same as [Fe/H]_1 being 0. So, n_Mg2 / n_H2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun).

Wait, no, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → log10(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) ) = 0 → so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → which is n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So back to Star_2:

n_Si2 = [n_Mg2 / 10^0.3 ] → which is [ (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H2 ] / 10^0.3.

But we can also express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Let me compute n_Si1 / n_H1 and n_Si2 / n_H2, then find the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2), which would give me (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

Wait, but I don't know n_H1 and n_H2. Do I need to? Because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which would be n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Hmm, maybe I can express everything in terms of a common base, like the Sun's composition.

Let me get back.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) * n_H1.

So n_Si1 / n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun).

For Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2) / (10^0.3).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So n_Si2 = [ (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H2 ] / 10^0.3.

So n_Si2 / n_H2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^0.3.

Now, the question is to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ] * (n_H2 / n_H1).

Wait, no—because (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_H2) * (n_H1/n_Si2) → Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of each star's silicon relative to hydrogen.

Wait, let me compute the ratio (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2) → which is (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2).

But I'm trying to find n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) ] * (n_H2 / n_H1) ) * (n_Si2/n_Si2) → Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star, and then find the ratio of those two ratios.

Let me compute:

For Star_1: (n_Si1 / n_H1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe1 *10^0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Fe1 *10^0.3 ) / n_H1 = [ (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H1 ] * 10^0.3 / n_H1 → So n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^0.3

Similarly, for Star_2:

From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) =0.3 → n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

So,

n_Si2 = n_Mg2 / 10^0.3 = [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2 ] / 10^0.3.

Thus,

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) = [ (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^0.3 ]

Simplify this:

= [ (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) *10^0.3 ] * [ 10^0.3 / (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) ) ]

= [ (n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3) ) ] * [ (n_H_sun ) / n_H_sun ) ].

Wait, the n_H_sun terms cancel out. So,

= [ (n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun ) ) * 10^(0.3+0.3) ]

= (n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun ) * 10^0.6.

But wait, I know the Sun's n_Fe and n_Mg relative to H. From the given data:

For the Sun:

log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H =10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log10(n_Mg/n_H) =7-12= -5 → n_Mg/n_H =10^(-5).

So, n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun = (n_Fe/n_H) / (n_Mg/n_H) ) = (10^-4.5 ) / (10^-5 ) ) = 10^(0.5) ≈ 3.1623.

So,

(n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun ) = 10^0.5.

So putting it back into the ratio:

( n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) = 10^0.5 * 10^0.6 = 10^(0.5 + 0.6 ) =10^1.1 ≈ 12.589.

So the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) is approximately 12.589.

But wait, that's the ratio of (n_Si1/n_H1) to (n_Si2/n_H2). So (n_Si1/n_H1) = 12.589 * (n_Si2/n_H2).

But I'm trying to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ), which is (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H2 / n_Si2).

Wait, no. n_Si1 / n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1 / n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 / n_H2 ) ) ] * (n_H2 / n_H1 )

Wait, no, because n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

But I don't know n_H1 and n_H2. So perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Wait, but wait. The problem says to "find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's n_Si1 / n_Si2. But without knowing the total number of atoms in each photosphere, perhaps we can assume that the total number of atoms is the same? Or perhaps, given that the question is about the ratio, maybe we can express it as (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 / n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 / n_H2 ) ) × (n_H1 / n_H2 )

Wait, but without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, how can I proceed? Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about each star's composition relative to hydrogen.

Star_1:

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2) / 10^0.3.

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2 / 10^0.3.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is [10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) *n_H2 /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] * [ 10^0.3 / (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H2 ) ]^{-1}

= [10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] * [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) *n_H2 / 10^0.3 ) ]^{-1}

Wait, let's invert the denominator:

= [10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun ) *n_H2 / 10^0.3 ) ]

= [10^0.3 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun * n_H1 ] * [ 10^0.3 / (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun * n_H2 ) ]

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun ) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun are known. n_Fe_sun is 10^-4.5 (relative to H). n_Mg_sun is 10^-5 (relative to H).

So,

n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun = (1e-4.5) / (1e-5) ) = 10^( -4.5 +5 )=10^0.5 ≈3.1623.

Putting it all together:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^0.6) * (10^0.5 ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Wait, wait, this seems off. Let me recompute.

Wait, 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 =10^0.6. Because 0.3 +0.3=0.6.

Then, (n_Fe_sun / n_Mg_sun )=10^0.5.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^0.6 * 10^0.5 * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

=10^(0.6 +0.5 ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )=10^1.1 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But wait, I don't know the ratio n_H1/n_H2. How can I proceed?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the fact that the stars' masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The problem doesn't give any information about the overall abundance or the total number of atoms, so maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the ratio of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], so the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, meaning that the Fe and Mg are solar relative to H. So, perhaps the [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and I can find the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, then take the ratio.

Wait, but let me try another approach. Maybe for Star_1, the [Si/H] can be determined.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]=0 → Fe is at solar abundance relative to H.

So [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] =0.3 → which is log(n_Si/n_Fe) =0.3 → so n_Si = n_Fe * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe is (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 *10^0.3.

So,

n_Si1 / n_H1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun)*n_H2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2 ) /10^0.3 = [ (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 ] /10^0.3.

So,

n_Si2 /n_H2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) /10^0.3.

Now, the ratio (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 /n_H2 ) is [ (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) /10^0.3 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^0.3 ] * [10^0.3 / (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) ]

= (n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3 )

= (n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun ) *10^0.6.

Now, n_Fe_sun/n_Mg_sun = (1e-4.5)/(1e-5) )=10^0.5 ≈3.1623.

So,

(n_Si1 /n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 /n_H2 ) =3.1623 * 10^0.6.

Calculate 10^0.6: 10^0.6 ≈3.9811.

So,

3.1623 *3.9811 ≈12.589.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) is approximately 12.589.

But I'm trying to find (n_Si1/n_Si2 ). How?

Hmm, because n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1 ) * (n_H2/n_Si2 ) = [ (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ] * (n_H2/n_H1 ) ) * (n_H2/n_Si2 ) * n_Si2/n_Si2 ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since both stars are main-sequence stars, their photospheric compositions are determined by their formation, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the total number of atoms in each star's photosphere is the same as the Sun's. But I don't think that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as in the Sun, but that's not given.

Wait, but the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, which implies that the abundance of Fe and Mg relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So for Star_1 and Star_2, n_Fe/n_H is the same as in the Sun, and same for n_Mg/n_H.

But wait, no, because [Fe/H] is zero, which means that n_Fe/n_H is the same as the Sun. So Star_1 has n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun ) → but [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't find n_Si1/n_Si2 directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, which would mean n_H1 =n_H2.

In that case, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 would be the same as (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H1 ), which is (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 ). If n_H1 =n_H2, then that ratio is 1.

So under that assumption, n_Si1/n_Si2 would be 12.589.

But wait, the options don't have 12.589. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So 12.589 is approximately 12.6 → which is option B.

Wait, but I'm assuming that n_H1 =n_H2, which I'm not sure is a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state anything about the hydrogen content of the stars.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says to use the EW method, but that's about how the abundances are determined, not about the overall number of atoms.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the ratio is (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ), which we calculated as ~12.589, so ~12.6 → option B.

But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si1/n_Si2. But without knowing the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2, I can't directly compute that.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio is [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, and using the solar values for Fe and Mg, and the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun ) divided by (n_Si2 /n_Si_sun ), which would give the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun, then take the ratio of those.

Hmm, let me try that approach.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1 ) =0.3 → n_Si1= n_Fe1 *10^0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 → n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 =1e-4.5 *n_H1 *10^0.3.

n_Si1 /n_Si_sun = [1e-4.5 *n_H1 *10^0.3 ] / [n_Si_sun ]

But n_Si_sun = n_Si_sun =n_Si_sun = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H_sun → because n_Si_sun/n_H_sun = [from Sun's data]

Wait, from the Sun's given data:

n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =1e-4.5 → [from 12 + log(n_Fe/n_H)=7.5 → log(n_Fe/n_H)= -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H=1e-4.5 → so n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Mg: n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

But what about Si in the Sun? The Sun's data doesn't give [Si/Fe], but perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) → n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun =10^{[Si/Fe]_sun}.

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun, but perhaps I can assume that solar ratios are such that n_Si_sun =n_Si_sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think instead about the ratio in terms of the abundances.

Another approach. Let's express [Si/Fe] and the other ratios in terms of their logarithms.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2 is (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 / n_H1 ) * (n_H2 /n_Si2 ).

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't compute this.

But wait, from Star_1 and Star_2, [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, which means:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 → n_H1 = (n_Fe1 *n_H_sun ) /n_Fe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2: n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 → n_H2 = (n_Mg2 *n_H_sun ) /n_Mg_sun.

But I don't know n_Fe1 or n_Mg2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio can be expressed without knowing the H's.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the ratio of the Si abundance in each star relative to the Sun, then take the ratio of those two.

In that case, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3 → so Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to H than in the Sun.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg is solar relative to H.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2 )=0.3 → n_Mg2= n_Si2 *10^0.3 → so [Mg/Si]=0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → [Si/Mg] =-0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Si/Mg] =-0.3 → [Si/H] = [Mg/H] + [Si/Mg] =0 + (-0.3 )= -0.3 → so Star_2's Si is 10^-0.3 times the solar abundance.

So,

Star_1: [Si/H]=0.3 → n_Si1 =10^0.3 *n_Si_sun.

Star_2: [Si/H]=-0.3 → n_Si2=10^-0.3 *n_Si_sun.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^0.3 ) / (10^-0.3 ) ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Which is approximately 3.98, so about 4. So the answer would be A) ~3.9.

Wait, this makes more sense. Let me check.

Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0.3 → so n_Si1 =10^0.3 *n_Si_sun.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Si/Mg]_2= -0.3 → [Si/H]_2= [Mg/H]_2 + [Si/Mg]_2 =0 -0.3 =-0.3 → n_Si2=10^-0.3 *n_Si_sun.

So the ratio is (10^0.3 ) / (10^-0.3 ) =10^(0.6 )≈3.98 → ~4. So the answer is A) ~3.9.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was ~12.6 but that was under the assumption that n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ), which was 12.589. But perhaps that approach was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

Because [Si/H] is log10(n_Si/n_H) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ).

So for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]=0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3 → n_Si1 =10^0.3 *n_Si_sun.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]=0.3 → [Si/Mg]=-0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 + [Si/Mg] =0 + (-0.3 )= -0.3 → n_Si2=10^-0.3 *n_Si_sun.

So the ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si_sun )/(n_Si2/n_Si_sun ) = (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 )=10^0.6≈3.98 → ~4.

So the correct answer is approximately 3.9, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios ([X/Y]).

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}}) = 0.3 \) → \( n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}} = 10^{0.3} \).
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) = 0.3 \) → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \).
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} \).

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - \( n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-4.5} \) (from \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \)).
   - \( n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-5} \) (from \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \)).

### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
The abundance ratio [X/H] is defined as:
\[
\text{[X/H]} = \log_{10}(n_{\text{X}} / n_{\text{H}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{XSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}})
\]

#### For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}}) = 0.3 \).
- [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} \).
- Using \( n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = (n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}}) \cdot (n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}}) \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}})
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-4.5} \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{-4.5} = 10^{-4.2}.
  \]
  Thus, [Si/H]₁ = 0.3.

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) = 0.3 \).
- [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} \).
- Using \( n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = (n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}}) / (n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = (n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) / 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-5} \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = 10^{-5} / 10^{0.3} = 10^{-5.3}.
  \]
  Thus, [Si/H]₂ = -0.3.

### Step 2: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}}}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{10^{-4.2}}{10^{-5.3}} = 10^{1.1}.
\]
Approximating \( 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6 \).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
