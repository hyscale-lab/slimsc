Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question involves two reactions and we need to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the options provided. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's probably an addition reaction.

Wait, what happens when a ketone adds HCN? Oh right, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, NaCN would provide the CN- ion. So the mechanism is that the CN- adds to the carbonyl, forming an intermediate which then gets protonated. But wait, in the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl C, so the product would initially form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be an a-hydroxy nitrile. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is four carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the structure CH2(COH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure would be (CH2)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of the cyanide adding to the ketone, followed by some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone undergoing a substitution after addition. Hmm.

Wait, no, I remember that the addition of HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl group is replaced by a hydroxyl and a cyano group. So the product would have both groups attached to the same carbon. So for butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, the addition would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product's structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me see the IUPAC name. The parent chain would be butanenitrile, but where is the hydroxyl?

Wait, butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the first carbon. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the molecule is CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Let me count: the nitrile is on carbon 1, the hydroxyl and methyl groups are on carbon 2. So structure would be CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Oh wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So the 2nd carbon would have the hydroxyl and a methyl group.

Wait, no. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So numbering from the nitrile end, it's 1, 2, 3, 4? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is four carbons. So the nitrile is on C-1, then C-2, C-3, C-4. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCN with a hydroxyl somewhere else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure part. Let's think about the reaction.

So the first step: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is the addition of CN- to the ketone. For the cyanohydrin formation, the reagent would be HCN, but in this case, NaCN is used, which provides the CN-.

But to form the cyanohydrin, you typically add HCN, but maybe in this case, another acid is needed as a catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, but the ketone is not very reactive towards it without some activation. So often, an acid catalyst is used to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So reagent A is likely an acid. Looking at the options, reagents A and B in options A, B, C, D are either H3O+ (like HCl), NaHSO3, or acetic acid.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ or CH3COOH or NaHSO3. Well, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid than H3O+ (H+). So H3O+ is a strong acid, perhaps from HCl or H2SO4. But wait, in the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

So in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Which one is more appropriate for the cyanohydrin formation?

I think that for the formation of cyanohydrin, HCN is added in the presence of an acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4. Wait, but in this case, the reactant is NaCN, not HCN. So perhaps in the first step, the reaction is the addition of CN- to the ketone, which is facilitated by an acid catalyst. So H3O+ (like HCl) would protonate the carbonyl, making it more reactive towards the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

Alternatively, if the reagent A is NaHSO3, that would provide HSO3^- which is a weaker acid. I'm not sure if that would be as effective as H3O+ in this case.

So for the first step, I think the correct reagent A is H3O+. Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Option C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the reaction involves the formation of the cyanohydrin via a different method. For example, sometimes, the use of a sulfonic acid or another catalyst is involved, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is not a simple cyanohydrin addition. Wait, another thought: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. The nitrile is on C-1, the hydroxyl and methyl on C-2, and then two more carbons? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so C-1 (CN), C-2 (OH and CH3), C-3, and C-4? No, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

Wait, when CN- adds to (CH3)2CO, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. That's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 3 carbons from the ketone (since butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO?), wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is four carbons: CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, so structure is CH2CH2CO. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is correct. So when the CN adds, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because the main chain would be three carbons: the nitrile is on C-1, the C-2 has the OH and CH3 groups. Wait, but the product in the question is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that suggests the main chain is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is longer. Let me think. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when the CN adds, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. The nitrile is on C-1, then the C-2 has the (CH3)2C(OH) group. Wait, that's only three carbons. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So perhaps there's a rearrangement or another step.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition. Another possibility is that the ketone undergoes a substitution after the addition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via an elimination step. Wait, but in that case, it would form a nitrile and lose water or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a cyanohydrin but something else. Wait, another reaction of ketones with cyanide? Maybe the formation of a cyanide via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but ketones don't typically undergo that. Wait, unless it's a keto-enol tautomerism. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reagent is H3O+ or another acid, which helps in the addition of CN- to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin, which then undergoes some further reaction. But in this case, the product is the cyanohydrin.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the other reaction to see if that gives me any clues.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a complicated structure) reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. But normally, nitriles hydrolyze to amides or acids under certain conditions. But the conditions matter.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, typically H2SO4 and heat, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt of the acid.

But the reagent B here is H2O. Wait, but maybe B is an acid or a base. Looking at the options, B can be HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: B = HCl

Option B: B = CH3COOH

Option C: B = HCl

Option D: B = CH3COOH

So in the second reaction, the reagent B (which is H2O) plus the reagent is either HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, the reaction is: nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually involve strong acid and heat. For example, using H2SO4 as the acid catalyst with H2O.

But in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid. So if the second reaction is using H2O and HCl, that would be an acidic environment. Alternatively, acetic acid is a weak acid.

Wait, the reaction is:

R-CN + H2O → R-COOH

Under acidic conditions, this would require strong acid and heat. So HCl would be a possible candidate. So reagent B would be HCl.

Wait, but in the options, for the second reaction, B is H2O and the reagent is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So perhaps the reagent is HCl, making the solution acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a base. No, because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely under acidic conditions.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. Since HCl is a strong acid, it would be more likely to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Putting this together, for the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (from HCl or H2SO4), and for the second, reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this fits.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → A is NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and A. So in the options, A is H3O+ (option A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). So if A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible.

In the first reaction, the correct reagent A is H3O+ because the reaction requires acid catalysis for the cyanide addition. So option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which fits both reactions.

Alternatively, let's double-check. If the first reagent is H3O+, then the reaction is acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin, which is the product given.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which requires strong acidic conditions (HCl), so B=HCl.

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

Yes, that matches. So the correct option is A.

The first reaction involves the addition of NaCN to butan-2-one (a ketone) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. To facilitate this reaction, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary protonation to activate the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions. HCl, being a strong acid, is the appropriate reagent to facilitate this reaction, as it provides the acidic environment necessary for the nitrile group to undergo hydrolysis.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the first reaction compared to H₃O⁺.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
