Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this looks like a two-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy terms. So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some space?

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric given. Let me think. A pseudosphere is an example of a surface with hyperbolic geometry, and its metric can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something similar.

Looking at the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). If I factor that, it becomes 4(1 - (x²+y²)/4). Which looks like 4(1 - (r²/4)), where r is sqrt(x²+y²). So the denominator becomes 4(1 - (r²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/(2²)). That makes me think of the Poincaré disk model, which has a metric (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²/L²)^2, where L is the curvature radius. Wait, but our metric is expressed in terms of dx² + dy², which is r² dθ in polar coordinates, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model with radius L=2, the metric would be (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²/4). But the given metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let's see: 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - r²/4). So the denominator is 4(1 - r²/4). So the given metric's coefficient is 32/(4(1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4). 

So the metric becomes (8/(1 - r²/4)) (r² dr² + r² dθ²) )? Wait no, wait. Wait, dx² + dy² in polar coordinates is dr² + r² dθ². So the given metric is (32)/(4 - r²) * (dr² + r² dθ²). So that's (32)/(4(1 - (r²)/4)) ) * (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8)/(1 - r²/4) * (dr² + r² dθ²).

In the Poincaré model, the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r²/L²)^2. So for L=2, it's (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r²/4)². Comparing to the given metric, which is 8/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the given metric seems different. Wait, but maybe I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric isn't the standard Poincaré metric. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conformally flat metric, which can be written as e^{2λ} (dr² + r² dθ²), where λ is some function.

Wait, let me think about the area. The area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is 4π L², but that's in the limit as the radius approaches infinity, I think. Wait no, wait. The pseudosphere (truncated at r=L) for the Poincaré disk has an infinite area, because as r approaches L from below, the area goes to infinity. Oh wait, but wait, the Poincaré disk model is a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area, but perhaps when you consider a pseudosphere with a certain radius, you might get a finite area. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere in the Poincaré model is 4π L², but wait no, no. Let me think. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has finite area. But in the Poincaré disk model, the surface area up to radius L would be π L² (1 - r²/L²) integrated from 0 to L? Wait, perhaps I should compute the area from the metric.

The area in a 2D metric is given by the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by dθ dφ or something. Wait, no. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2}) dr dθ. But since the metric is diagonal, g_{rθ}=0, so it's just g_{rr} g_{θθ} dr dθ.

Wait, in our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the metric tensor components are g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²). The off-diagonal terms are zero. So the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. But for a diagonal metric, det g is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So sqrt(det g) is (32 r)/(4 - r²).

Wait, no. Wait, area element in 2D is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2) dr dθ. Since g_{rθ}=0, it's sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. Which is sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) dr dθ. Inside the sqrt, that's (32 * 32 r² )/(4 - r²)^2 ) = (1024 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. The square root of that is (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral over r and θ. Since the problem is asking for a pseudosphere of radius r=2, I think we're integrating up to r=2. So the limits would be r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let’s compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let’s do substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - (4)=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is [32 * (-1/2) ) ] ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

The integral of (1/u) du is ln|u|. So putting it together:

= [ -16 ] [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

But wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So ln(0) is -infinity, ln(4)= ln(4).

So [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-infinity) - ln(4) = -infinity.

So the inner integral becomes -16 * (-infinity - ln(4)) ) = 16*(infinity + ln(4)), which is infinity. So the inner integral diverges.

Wait, so A = ∫0 to 2π dθ * [ divergent integral ].

Which would make the area infinite. So the area is infinite.

Now, looking back at the options: option D is +infty.

Wait, but the problem states it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, perhaps I misapplied the limits. Because in the Poincaré disk model, the radius r in the model is not the same as the geometric radius of the pseudosphere.

Wait, let me think. The Poincaré disk model has a coordinate radius r that goes up to L, but the actual 'radius' of the pseudosphere (like the maximum distance from the origin) is infinite. Wait, no, because in hyperbolic geometry, the distance from the origin to the boundary (r approaching L) is infinite. So the pseudosphere (tractricoid) in the model has an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is tricking me, because the metric given might represent a sphere with infinite area.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see the denominator 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. So the surface is only defined for x² + y² <4. Hmm, but then the maximum r is 2. So the area would be up to r=2.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the inner integral, I found that the area up to r=2 is infinite. So the area is infinite.

So the answer should be D) +infty.

Wait, but what if the metric is for a sphere instead of a pseudosphere? No, because a pseudosphere has negative curvature, and a sphere has positive curvature. So the metric's sign would matter. Let me think about the Ricci scalar or the Gaussian curvature.

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E (dr² + r² dθ²) is K = -E''/E, where E is the coefficient. So E = 32/(4 - r²). Let me compute E''.

First, E = 32 (4 - r²)^{-1}.

E' = 32 * (-1) * (-2 r) (4 - r²)^{-2} = 64 r (4 - r²)^{-2}.

E'' = derivative of E' w.r. to r.

So E'' = 64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + r * (-2) (4 - r²)^{-3} (-2 r) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute E'': E' =64 r (4 - r²)^{-2}.

So E'' is: 64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + r * (-2)*(4 - r²)^{-3} * (-2 r) ) ].

Wait, no, applying product rule: d/dr (64 r (4 - r²)^{-2}) = 64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + r * d/dr ( (4 - r²)^{-2} ) ) ]

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} is (-2)(-2 r) (4 - r²)^{-3} ) = 4 r (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So E'' = 64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + r * 4 r (4 - r²)^{-3} ) ]

=64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + 4 r² (4 - r²)^{-3} ) ]

Factor out (4 - r²)^{-3}:

=64 (4 - r²)^{-3} [ (4 - r²) + 4 r² ].

=64 (4 - r²)^{-3} [4 - r² +4 r² ].

=64 (4 - r²)^{-3} (4 + 3 r²).

So Gaussian curvature K = - E'' / E.

E is 32/(4 - r²).

So,

K = - [64 (4 + 3 r²) (4 - r²)^{-3} ] / [32 (4 - r²)^{-1} ]

Simplify:

64/32 =2.

(4 - r²)^{-3} / (4 - r²)^{-1} ) = (4 - r²)^{-2}.

So,

K= -2 (4 +3 r²) (4 - r²)^{-2}.

Hmm, this is negative everywhere where 4 - r² >0 (since r <2). So the Gaussian curvature is negative, indicating a pseudosphere.

So the surface is a pseudosphere with Gaussian curvature K = negative. But the area is infinite because the integral diverges as r approaches 2.

So the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2D surface with negative curvature, consistent with a pseudosphere. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we use the area element derived from the metric. In polar coordinates, \(dx^2 + dy^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\), so the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}\). From the metric, \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\). Thus:

\[
\det g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(1/u\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. This is consistent with the fact that the surface described by the metric has negative curvature and extends to \(r = 2\), where the metric coefficient blows up. The infinite area reflects the infinite extent of the pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry.

The correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
