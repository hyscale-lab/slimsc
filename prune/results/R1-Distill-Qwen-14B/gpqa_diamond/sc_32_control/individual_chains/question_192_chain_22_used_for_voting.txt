Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my classes that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and it's not at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Also, r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity can't be bigger than the conductor itself.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the key here is to use the concept of electrostatic shielding or the properties of conductors. Wait, when a conductor is uncharged, any charge placed inside a cavity doesn't induce charges on the outer surface, right? But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so when we add a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect things?

Oh, wait, I remember something called the method of images or the shell theorem. Let me think. For a conducting shell, if there's a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface will have induced charges based on the net charge of the conductor. But in this case, the conductor is initially neutral. So, the inner surface will have a charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, so in this case, the conductor was uncharged, so after adding +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral (since it was initially uncharged). But wait, no, wait—the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So when the charge +q is placed inside, the inner surface must have -q to shield the conductor's material from the electric field. Then, the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's total charge zero (since +q from the cavity is inside, conductor's inner is -q, so outer must be +q).

But wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero, right? Because it was initially uncharged. So, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, because the net charge is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. But wait, no—the conductor's total charge is zero. So, when a charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (to cancel the field inside the conductor's material), and the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero.

Wait, but is the conductor still neutral? Because the problem says the conductor is uncharged. So yeah, the conductor's total charge is zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q.

But wait, does this affect the electric field outside the conductor?

Hmm, the electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within. So, the outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside would be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this scenario, the setup is a bit more complex because the cavity isn't at the center. The center of the cavity is separated by s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at some position relative to both.

So, when we have a charge inside a cavity not at the center, the induced charges on the inner surface would arrange themselves in a way that the electric field within the conductor is zero. That's because the conductor is a conductor, so the charges move to cancel any internal fields.

But when considering the external field, the field due to the outer surface charge would be as if all that charge were at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the outer surface's charge is +q. So when we're looking at a point outside, the field should be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, right?

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the cavity's center is s away from the conductor's center. So, does the position of the cavity affect the external field?

Wait, no. The external field depends only on the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. Because for a spherical conductor, any charges on the outer surface produce an electric field as if all the charge were at the center.

But wait, is there any effect from the way the charges are arranged inside the cavity? For example, since the charge is off-center, maybe the induced charges on the inner surface are arranged in a certain way. But for the exterior field, that arrangement doesn't matter because the outer surface charge is symmetric.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, I'm not sure how that comes into play. Maybe the field at P is from the outer surface's charge, which is +q, and the field is directed radially outward, so using Coulomb's law with the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but the field from a point charge is radial, so the direction would be from the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity. So, perhaps the field at P is the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the problem says the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, so the field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because that's the formula for a point charge.

But looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². Option D is q/(l²), but that would be the case if the field was due to the charge at the cavity's center, but since the conductor's outer surface is uniformly distributing the +q, the field outside is as if it were at the center.

Wait, but another thought: the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside is due to that charge. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is distributed spherically symmetrically around the conductor's center, the field at any point outside depends only on the distance from the conductor's center.

So, if point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². Because all the +q is on the outer surface, and for a spherical shell, the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, let me think again. The conductor is uncharged before, so the total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, the outer surface +q. So the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the outer surface has +q. So the field outside is due to +q.

But wait, the conductor's radius is R. So, the point P is outside, so L > R.

So, the field at P would be directed radially outward, with magnitude E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is this expression. Option D is q/(l²), which would be the case if the charge were at the center of the cavity and point P is l away, but that's not the case for the external field.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To solve this, we use the properties of conductors in electrostatics. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor remains zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$.

The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (due to spherical symmetry). In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, so the electric field outside the conductor is determined by this charge. The point $P$ is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, so the electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches the expression in option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the external field, as the external field depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.
- Option C involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also incorrect for the same reason as A.
- Option D involves $l^2$, which would be correct if the field were due to the charge at the cavity's center, but the external field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, not the position of the cavity.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
