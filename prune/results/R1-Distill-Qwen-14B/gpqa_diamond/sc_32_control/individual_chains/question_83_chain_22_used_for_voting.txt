Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. 

The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me break it down. First, the initial solution after dilution. Diluting equal volumes, so the concentration should be half, right? Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.

Molarity is moles per liter. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no. The original solution before dilution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, which is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating, the 25% titration point is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So how much NaOH is added then?

Wait, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized. So 25% titration means 0.25 times the equivalence point volume. So I need to find out how much NaOH is used at 25% and at 100% (equivalence point) to find the pH at those points.

But maybe I should handle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the product is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. Sodium acetate will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So, let's calculate the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence.

Total volume at equivalence: the initial solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH volume can be calculated.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases: [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't dilute enough for the approximation. Let's try without the approximation.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Let x be [OH^-]. Then, (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = Kb. Since Kb is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (1e-14 / 1.85e-5) * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH 9.02.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the equivalence points are in the 6.73, 7.00, 6.92, 8.52. Wait, none are around 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscalculated the moles of NaOH or the volume. Let me double-check.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed for equivalence: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct. So total volume at equivalence is 40+10=50 cm³. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054e-9, which is 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, so the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the solution after equivalence isn't that high? Maybe I messed up the stoichiometry.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just the acetate. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you dilute the solution, the concentration changes?

Wait, another thought: Did I correctly calculate the moles of NaOH needed?

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So NaOH needed is also 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

Total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that at equivalence, the solution is a buffer because we're adding strong base to a weak acid. No, wait, at equivalence, all acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

So why am I getting a pH around 9, but options don't have it. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92.

Wait, option D says equivalence point pH is 6.92, which is lower than 7. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, no, wait. Acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic, pH>7. But all the options have equivalence point pH less than 8 except option A, which is 8.52. So why is my calculation giving pH 9?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate [OH^-].

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration c = 0.02 M.

Using the formula [OH^-] = sqrt(c*Kb) = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10).

0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11.

Sqrt(1.081e-11) is approx 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is log(1.04e-5) is about 4.98. So pH=14-4.98=9.02. That's correct.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry during the dilution. Wait, the initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when you dilute, the solution is not just a simple dilution? No, that's correct. M1V1 = M2V2 → 0.05 *20 = M2 *40 → M2=0.025.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for the pH at equivalence point in another way. Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just the acetate but maybe some excess of base? No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized. So it's just the acetate.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely, without the approximation.

The exact expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, so x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5, as before. So pH is 9.02.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is not at 25 degrees C, but the problem states 25°C, so no, that shouldn't affect it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetic acid. Let me recheck that.

Initial volume of acetic acid: 20 cm³. Molarity 0.05 M.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Volume after adding 20 cm³ of water: 40 cm³.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So everything seems correct, but the equivalence pH calculated is 9.02, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not for the equivalence point but for 25% titration. Or maybe I confused the two.

Wait, perhaps the first part is the pH at 25% titration, which is halfway to the equivalence point, but wait, 25% would be a quarter of the way. Wait, no, 25% of the titration would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Let me think about the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. So moles neutralized = 0.25 *0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added.

How much NaOH is added? Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the volume of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.736.

[A^-] is acetate, [HA] is acetic acid.

So pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.736 -0.477 ≈4.259.

Rounding to two decimal places, 4.26.

So for 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But we have a problem because the equivalence point pH I calculated was about 9.02, but none of the options have that.

Wait, but perhaps I calculated the equivalence point wrong. Let me re-examine the equivalence point again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate and excess NaOH. No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so no excess.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I miscalculated Kb. Let me double-check.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Oh wait! The solution after equivalence is a solution of acetate ions, but perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution correctly.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001 moles.

Concentration is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression should be correct.

So I think my initial calculation is correct, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the options have a mistake? Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the equivalence point calculation.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = log(1.04e-5) = ~4.98.

pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is lower than 9. Maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait! I think I see the mistake. Oh no! Wait, when we dilute the solution, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, but perhaps I should have considered that the solution is in a different volume.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because moles are 0.001, volume is 0.05 L. So 0.02 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Let me redo the Kb calculation without approximation.

Set up the equation:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, neglecting x.

x² ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

So, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as a more precise value.

But I think I'm correct. So where are the options getting these numbers?

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the question. No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point pH. Let's think differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution at equivalence is a buffer because the solution is in excess. No, that's not right. At equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, unless the solution is made with a different volume. Let me check again.

Wait, when I add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40+10=50 cm³. Correct.

So acetate is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L, 0.02 M.

Hmm... So why don't the options match? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Hmm, 8.52 is lower than my calculated 9.02. Maybe there's an error in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: Did I perhaps miscalculate the concentration of acetate?

Wait, moles of acetate is 0.001, volume is 0.05 L. 0.001 / 0.05 is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the volume of the solution at equivalence. Wait, the problem says we titrate the diluted solution (40 cm³) with 0.1 M NaOH. So at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that during the titration, more NaOH is added beyond equivalence, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that the equivalence point is not at 10 cm³ but something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the equivalence point again.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is (0.001) / (0.1) = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So the volume at equivalence is 50 cm³.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not in 50 cm³ but in 40 cm³? No, because we added 10 cm³. So 50 cm³ is correct.

Wait, perhaps the user used a different approach for the equivalence point, like using the half-equivalence point or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the solution is that the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH is equal to the moles of acetic acid. But perhaps I didn't account for the fact that the acetic acid is diluted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molarity after dilution.

Wait, in any case, the calculations seem correct. So perhaps the problem is that the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the 25% titration point's pH.

As I calculated earlier, 4.26 is one of the options (option A). So if the equivalence point is 9.02, but none of the options have that, perhaps the question is asking for the 25% point and another point, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles neutralized: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Thus, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles.

Volume of solution: 40 cm³ + volume of NaOH added.

How much NaOH is added? 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L =2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is about 4.736.

Log(0.005882/0.017647)= log(0.333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.736 -0.477=4.259≈4.26.

So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 for the first part. So the first part is 4.26, the second part is 8.52. But I calculated equivalence point as 9.02, which none of the options have.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the solution is not considering the dilution correctly.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is that when the solution is diluted, the pH changes.

Wait, no, the pH after dilution could be different, but in this case, we're adding titrant, so it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point but about the 25% and 75% points. But no, the question says 25% titration and equivalence.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of using Kb, I should use the hydrolysis reaction of acetate.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb= [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] =5.405e-10.

Assume [CH3COOH] =x, [OH^-]=x.

So (x^2)/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, 0.02-x≈0.02.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

x=1.04e-5 M.

pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

Hmm. So I think my calculation is correct. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the 25% titration relative to the initial solution, not the diluted one. But no, the problem says we diluted it first, then titrated the resulting solution.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when you dilute, the concentration of H+ changes. Wait, no, because after dilution, the solution is a weaker acid.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH of the diluted solution before titration.

Wait, the initial pH of the diluted acetic acid (0.025 M) can be calculated, but the question isn't about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 25% titration is relative to the initial solution, not the diluted one. No, the titration is performed on the diluted solution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 25% titration isn't 25% of the moles, but 25% of the volume. No, because titration is based on moles, not volume. So 25% of the titration refers to 25% of the moles of acetic acid being neutralized.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me see what the options are:

Option A) 4.26;8.52.

So for 25% titration, pH is 4.26, which matches my calculation. But equivalence is 8.52.

But my calculation says equivalence pH is 9.02. So perhaps the answer is not in the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me try to recompute.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the solution is a buffer at the equivalence point. No, at equivalence, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base only.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when I added 10 cm³ of NaOH, the volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration of sodium acetate is 0.02 M. But perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is not in 50 cm³ but in 40 cm³. But why would that be?

Wait, no, the solution is 40 cm³ of acetic acid plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ total. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the NaOH is 0.1 M, but I've miscalculated the moles. Let me recheck.

Moles of NaOH added at equivalence: 0.001 moles. Correct.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the options have a mistake, but given the available options, I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point in option A is 8.52. Let me see what pH would that correspond to.

pH=8.52 → pOH=5.48 → [OH]=2.63e-6 M.

[OH]^2 / (0.02) = Kb → (2.63e-6)^2 /0.02 = (6.9169e-12)/0.02=3.458e-10.

But Kb is 5.405e-10. So this is not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate whether the initial acetic acid concentration is correct.

Wait, wait! Oh no! I think I see the mistake. Oh no! Wait, when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid into 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.

But wait, when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, the moles it brings are important. So when you reach equivalence, moles of NaOH must equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Another thought: Perhaps I should use the concentration of the solution at equivalence point and calculate the pH using the exact formula without assuming x is negligible.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me solve this quadratic equation.

x² = (0.02 -x)*5.405e-10.

Expanding: x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

Square root: sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/(2).

Only positive root makes sense.

x= ( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.5706e-6)/2 =3.285e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.285e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.285e-6)≈5.485.

pH=14-5.485=8.515≈8.52.

Oh! So that's where option A's equivalence point pH of 8.52 comes from.

Wait, so I made a mistake in assuming that x was much smaller than 0.02. It turns out that x is not negligible, so I can't approximate.

So, the correct [OH^-] is about 3.285e-6, which gives pH=8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

Now, going back to the 25% titration point, the pH was 4.26.

So the correct pair is 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought I was using the wrong assumption, but now, upon solving the quadratic, the equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a 0.025 M acetic acid solution. The titration is performed with 0.1 M NaOH, and we calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: pH at 25% Titration**

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.  
- Initial moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Moles neutralized = \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Remaining moles of acetic acid = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Moles of acetate formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).  

The total volume of the solution is \( 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M} \).  
- Concentration of acetate = \( \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M} \).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right)
\]  
- \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736 \).  
- \( \text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) \).  
- \( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \).  
- \( \text{pH} \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.26 \).

---

### **Step 2: pH at Equivalence Point**

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate.  
- Moles of sodium acetate = \( 0.001 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Total volume = \( 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of acetate = \( \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).  

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).  

Using the expression for \( K_b \):  
\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[CH_3\text{COO}^-]}
\]  
\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [CH_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}
\]  
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.285 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]  
- \( \text{pOH} = -\log(3.285 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485 \).  
- \( \text{pH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.52 \).
