Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the explicit form is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as matrices. Let me write them down as I remember.

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

So, the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² ), where A is the operator in question, here P_z.

But wait, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, maybe calculating the expectation values would be easier.

Because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value <P_z> is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, and <P_z²> is the weighted sum of the squares of the eigenvalues since for an eigenstate, (P_z |ψ>) = λ|ψ>, so (P_z² |ψ>) = λ² |ψ>.

Wait, but the given state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So, the state is not an eigenstate of P_z. So, I can't directly say that <P_z> is the eigenvalue; I need to compute it.

Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, which means the states |m> are such that P_z |m> = m ħ |m>, with m being +1, 0, -1 or something like that. Wait, looking at the P_z matrix, the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis states are |+, 0, ->. So the state |ψ> is a linear combination of these basis states.

Wait, the state is given as ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4 ) = (1 + 2 +1 )/4 = 4/4=1. So yes, it's normalized.

So, the components are a= -1/2 for the first component (eigenvalue ħ), b= 1/√2 for the second (eigenvalue 0), and c= -1/2 for the third (eigenvalue -ħ). So, the state is a|+> + b|0> + c|->.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of P_z are not necessarily just ħ and -ħ. Wait, let me double-check the P_z matrix. The first row is [ħ, 0, 0], so the eigenvalue is ħ. Third row is [0,0,-ħ], so eigenvalue is -ħ. The middle is 0. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, the state is |ψ> = a|ħ> + b|0> + c|−ħ>, where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

Wait, but wait: in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates are usually denoted |+z> and |−z> for spin-1/2 systems, but here it's a spin-1 system perhaps, but regardless, the basis is the eigenstates of P_z, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So each component tells the amplitude for that eigenstate.

Now, to compute <P_z>, it's the expectation value of P_z in state |ψ>, which is a* ħ a* + b* 0 b* + c* (-ħ) c* ?

Wait, no. Because P_z in the eigenbasis acts diagonally. So the expectation value <P_z> is sum |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.

Because the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates. So each component's square modulus is the probability.

So, the state is |ψ> = a|ħ> + b|0> + c|−ħ>, with a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Wait, the square of the magnitude of a is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly for c. b is 1/√2, so square is 1/2.

So, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

Now, for <P_z^2>, since each eigenstate has eigenvalue squared.

So, <P_z²> is (1/4)*(ħ²) + (1/2)*(0)^2 + (1/4)*( (-ħ)^2 )

Which is (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = ½ ħ².

So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (½ ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(½) ħ = ħ/(√2).

Wait, but let me think again. Because the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so when you compute <P_z>, it's just the sum of |a|² * eigenvalue, etc. And since the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, the average is (1/4)*ħ + (1/4)*(-ħ) )= 0. So yes, correct.

But wait, the uncertainty formula is correct? Yes. Because variance is <A²> - <A>².

So the uncertainty in P_z is sqrt(½) ħ = ħ/(√2). So that's option B.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so measuring P_z would give ħ, 0, or -ħ, each with probabilities (1/4), (1/2), (1/4) respectively.

Wait, but wait: is the state |ψ> an eigenstate of P_x? Hmm, the question says that the system is found in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So |ψ> is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z.

But in this case, because the basis is of P_z, it's a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates. So, when computing the expectation values, we can treat each component as a probability for each eigenvalue.

So, the expectation value is correct as 0, and expectation of P_z squared is (1/2) ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given state, we proceed as follows:

The state of the system is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. The state $|\psi\rangle$ is expressed in this eigenbasis, with components $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. These components represent the amplitudes of the eigenstates with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, respectively.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The state is already normalized, as the sum of the squares of the components is:

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

The probabilities are $|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot (\hbar)^2 + |b|^2 \cdot (0)^2 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar)^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
