Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. From what I remember, the intrinsic angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics is often represented using Pauli matrices. 

Okay, the setup: Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. Wait a second, that looks familiar. Isn't that the structure of the Pauli Y matrix? Or maybe the Pauli X or Z? Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, often denoted as σy.

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±ħ/2, but wait, the actual units here might be different. Let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by some constant, the eigenvalues scale by that constant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz each have eigenvalues ±1. So the operator S here is σy, so its eigenvalues are ±1. But our operator Ay is c multiplied by S, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times ±1. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So that's plus and minus h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each one. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues of these spin matrices are real or imaginary? The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So why would option A have imaginary parts? Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. The Pauli matrices like σy are Hermitian? Let me double-check. The Pauli Y matrix is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as the original. So, yes, σy is Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues of Ay must be real. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. Wait, looking at the options, option A and B are about the parts of eigenvalues. Since eigenvalues are real, their imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So those can be ruled out.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A squared, but not of the Z-component Az. Wait, I think that if a vector is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's also an eigenstate of A² because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az, the z-component? Well, Ay and Az don't commute, so they can't share eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C would be correct in that sense. But wait, the option says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So C sounds correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would typically be the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions of Ay would be the eigenvectors of the matrix, which are not the same as the standard basis vectors unless the matrix is diagonal. Since Ay is not diagonal (since σy is not diagonal), the eigenvectors are not the standard basis functions. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let me think again.

So, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). Since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by (h/(4π)), those become the eigenvalues.

So looking at the options again:

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, Re parts ±h/(4π). That's wrong because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, Re parts ±1. Also wrong, because eigenvalues are real and have magnitude h/(4π).

So options A and B are incorrect.

Option C: Correct in that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Because A² is S·S, which is (σy²) scaled by c². Since c is a scalar, σy² is I, the identity matrix. So A² would be (h/(4π))² * I. The identity matrix has all vectors as eigenvectors. So any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A² (because A² is identity times a scalar, so every vector is an eigenvector). But the eigenvectors of Ay do not commute with Az, so they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are basis functions of the matrix. But the basis functions are standard basis vectors, while the eigenvectors of Ay (σy) are (1, i) and (1, -i) up to normalization. So these are not the standard basis vectors, so D is incorrect.

So the correct statements would be option C and perhaps option D is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So the correct statement is C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, given as:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**  
   The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real because \( S \) is Hermitian.

2. **Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues:**  
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, meaning their imaginary parts are zero. This rules out **Option A**, which incorrectly states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and **Option B**, which incorrectly states that the imaginary parts are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Eigenfunctions and Commutators:**  
   The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of \( S \). These eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors but are instead linear combinations of them. Additionally, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum) do commute, meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). This makes **Option C** correct.

4. **Eigenfunctions as Basis Functions:**  
   The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of \( S \), which are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, **Option D** is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
