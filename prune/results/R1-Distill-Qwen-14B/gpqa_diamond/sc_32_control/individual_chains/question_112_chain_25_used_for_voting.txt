Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. I think that means they're orthogonal and each has a norm of 1. 

The task is to find two things: first, the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation A has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so if i is not equal to j, it's hbar/2, but if i equals j, it's zero. So the matrix must look like this for a 2x2 system (since we're dealing with up and down spins):

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for a 2-level system, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, so when i=1 and j=2 (and vice versa), they're different, so those elements are hbar/2. The diagonals are zero.

Wait, but wait—what's the eigenbasis of this operator A? Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in that eigenbasis.

So I think the approach is to diagonalize matrix A to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues. Then, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and from there get the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe we can find the expectation values directly.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues.

The matrix A is:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

This is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors will be orthogonal.

The eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

Expanding that: λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ±hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

What about the eigenvectors? Let's find them.

For λ = hbar/2:
(A - λI) v = 0 → 
[ (-hbar/2), hbar/2 ] [v1]   = 0
[ hbar/2, (-hbar/2) ] [v2]

From the first equation: (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as (1,1) up to a scalar. But it's better to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:
(A + λI) v =0 →
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ] [v1] =0
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ] [v2]

Which gives hbar/2 (v1 + v2) = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait no, wait: Wait, the way I wrote it, when λ is positive, the vector is (1,1), which corresponds to (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) because each component is the amplitude for |up> and |down>, respectively.

Similarly, the negative eigenvalue corresponds to (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> and |-> as I wrote.

So the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 with corresponding eigenstates |+> and |->.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue when the state is |alpha>, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

But first, let me note that the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So I should first normalize |alpha> to get the actual state vector.

Wait, the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that, so I guess I need to find the normalization factor. Let's compute the norm squared of (1+i, 2 -i).

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2) = 2.

|2 -i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T in the |up>, |down> basis.

But I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->, since that's the basis where the operator's action is diagonal.

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Expressed in the |+>, |-> basis.

We can find the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Let me write |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So expressing |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->:

|alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Then, substituting:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) 
= [a + b] |up>/sqrt(2) + [a - b] |down>/sqrt(2).

But from earlier, |alpha> in |up>, |down> basis is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So setting coefficients equal:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

(a + b) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
(a - b) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, solving for a and b.

Adding the two equations:
2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Subtracting the two equations:
2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2*sqrt(7))
Simplify sqrt(2)/(2) is 1/sqrt(2), so:
b = (-1 + 2i) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) ) 
= (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

So now we have a and b.

Then, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3 / sqrt(14)
|a|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |b|^2:

b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)
|b|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4) /14 =5/14 ≈0.357142...

Wait, but that's 5/14 ≈0.357, but the options don't show 0.64 and 0.36. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, so that matches. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. I'm seeing that the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2, which are 9/14 and 5/14. So the probability for measuring hbar/2 is 9/14 (≈0.64), and -hbar/2 is 5/14 (≈0.36). So the first part of the answer, the probabilities, would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of the operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we have the state expressed in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Which would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9/14 -5/14] * hbar/2 = (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * hbar/2 = (2 hbar) / (7*2) )= hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7.

So looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, when I computed a and b, let's double-check.

The equations were:

(a + b) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
(a - b) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Yes.

Adding them:

2a = (3) * sqrt(2/7) → a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) → 3/(sqrt(14)).

Yes, because sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7), so 3/2 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is 3*sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) → which is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Yes. Because 3*sqrt(2)/(2*sqrt(7)) = 3/(sqrt(14)) [since sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14), and 2 in denominator cancels with sqrt(2) giving 3/(sqrt(14))].

Similarly, subtracting the equations:

2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) → b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So |b|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = 5/14.

And |a|^2 is [3^2]/14 =9/14.

So the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * hbar/2 = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

That's correct.

So the answer would be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A's average is hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but another way to compute the expectation value would be to calculate <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

Because A is given as a matrix with elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so i and j can be 1 and 2. So A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

So matrix A is:

[ 0          hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2      0    ]

Wait, but wait. The initial state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is a column vector, let's denote it as:

|alpha> = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ a*, b* ].

So A |alpha> = [0 a + (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a + 0 b ]^T.

So the first component is (hbar/2) * b.

The second component is (hbar/2) * a.

So <alpha| A |alpha> = [ a*, b* ] * [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Which is a* * (hbar/2) b + b* * (hbar/2) a.

Factor out hbar/2:

hbar/2 [ a* b + b* a ].

But a* b + b* a is 2 Re(a* b), since a* b is a complex number, and b* a is its complex conjugate.

So 2 Re(a* b) = 2 Re( (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

Wait, a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) / 7.

Let me compute (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part of (1-3i) is 1. So Re(a* b) = 1/7.

So 2 Re(a* b) = 2/7.

So putting it all together:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 (which is option A's 0.64) and 5/14 ≈0.357 (option A's 0.36). The average is hbar/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But let me check the other options to make sure I didn't misread anything.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, 3/sqrt(7) is about 1.133, but our average is hbar/7, which is about 0.142 hbar. So option B doesn't match.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7). Wait, 1/sqrt(7) is approximately 0.377, but our average is about 0.142 hbar. So no.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7). 2/sqrt(7) is about 0.755, but our average is 0.142 hbar. So no.

So the only match is option A.

The problem involves an electron state \( |\alpha\rangle \), proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of \( A \)
The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which yields \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 2: Normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm squared of this state is:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the Eigenbasis of \( A \)
The eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are expressed as:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
Substituting these into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we write:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle,
\]
where the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are determined by solving:
\[
a + b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Adding and subtracting these equations gives:
\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |b|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average Value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \), we find:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

Answer: A
