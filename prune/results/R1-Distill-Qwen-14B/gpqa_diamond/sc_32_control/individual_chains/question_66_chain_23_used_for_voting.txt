Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, labeled 1 to 4.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. Effective theories usually preserve the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM. So the SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Let me list what each symmetry entails.

Lorentz Symmetry (1): This includes all the symmetries of special relativity, like rotations and boosts. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT have to be Lorentz scalars, meaning their terms are constructed in a way that they don't break Lorentz invariance. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Poincare Symmetry (2): Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. The Poincare group is the foundation of relativity. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, SMEFT must as well. So the operators in SMEFT should be Poincare invariant. Wait, but wait—does this include things like momentum conservation? Hmm, I think in the SMEFT framework, the operators are local, so they must transform appropriately under the Poincare group. So yes, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

CP Symmetry (3): CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon and B meson systems. So in the SM, CP isn't a symmetry that all interactions respect. Therefore, the SMEFT operators don't have to preserve CP symmetry. In fact, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP, which can explain CP violation phenomena beyond the SM, like in the Higgs sector if needed. So I think 3 is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.

CPT Symmetry (4): CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, so any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect it. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. So 4 is correct.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait: wait a second, the options are 1,2,4 as a group, right?

Looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2. So the correct ones are 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait again. Are Poincare and Lorentz symmetries separate? Because Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So in SMEFT, when you write down the Lagrangian, it has to be Poincare invariant. So all operators must be Poincare scalars, which implies they must be Lorentz scalars as well. So yes, both 1 and 2 must hold. But wait, is the question phrased as which must be respected. So in SMEFT, the operators must be Poincare invariant, so both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So the options are C) 1,2,4 and A) 1,2. No, wait: option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant, but the converse isn't necessarily true. So yes, 1 and 2 are both required. So the answer includes 1,2,4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry is fundamental to the SM and includes transformations like rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is constructed to respect the SM's symmetries, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures that the theory remains consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry extends Lorentz symmetry to include translations in space and time. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must as well. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Poincaré-invariant, which implies they are also Lorentz-invariant. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The SM does not universally respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in certain processes (e.g., in kaon and B meson systems). Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to preserve CP symmetry, as they can include terms that violate CP to explain such phenomena.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, all operators in SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
