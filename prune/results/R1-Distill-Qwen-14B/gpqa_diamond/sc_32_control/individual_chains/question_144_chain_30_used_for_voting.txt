Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with a different value.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau, the proper lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. I'll need to convert the units properly.

So first, let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using Γ.
2. Find the velocity (beta) and Lorentz factor (gamma) of the meson.
3. Use these to compute the decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Let's start step by step.

Step 1: Calculate tau.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Remember that ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (femtometers), and ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, units are a bit tricky. Let me convert Γ into GeV.

Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is about (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 ÷ 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So yes, 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Step 2: Find gamma and beta.

But for that, I need the velocity of the meson when it's produced. Hmm, how to get that?

The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is related to the mass and momentum via E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, this simplifies. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 and ħ=1 for simplicity, but when plugging into equations, I'll have to account for units.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to work in SI units or something manageable. Alternatively, think of E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v.

Alternatively, since E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), then E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4.

We can solve for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c^2 ?

Wait, maybe better to compute beta and gamma using E and m.

E = gamma m c^2.

So gamma = E / (m c^2). Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². Hmm, but let's think in terms of units.

But wait, let me get the units right. Let's see, the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c², so when I calculate E = gamma m c^2, the units will work out.

So gamma = E_X / (m_X c²). But wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c².

Wait, but in the equation E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c^2). But wait, the units here: E is in GeV, m in GeV/c². So when you multiply m by c², you get GeV.

Because (GeV/c²) * (m/s)^2 = GeV * (m^2/s²) / c^4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me perhaps better to compute gamma as E/(m c^2).

Wait, units aside, let's plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c².

So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → the c² cancels, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Then, beta can be found from gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2).

So gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma is about 0.15. So 1 - 0.15^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

gamma = 8 / (1.2) ) → 8 ÷ 1.2 = 6.666666..., okay.

So 1/gamma^2 = (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as I said.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

Step 3: Compute the decay length L.

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have gamma ≈ 6.6667, beta ≈ 0.9887.

Multiply them: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ Let's compute that.

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let me compute:

0.9887 is approximately 0.9887.

6.6667 * 0.9887 = let's see, 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6602. So total ≈5.9322 + 0.6602 = 6.5924.

So about 6.5924.

Then, multiply by c (speed of light) and tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.5924 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 6.5924:

6.170625e-16 m * 6.5924 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625e-16 * 6.5924.

First, 6 * 6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.

0.5924 * 6.170625e-16 → 0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853e-16; 0.0924 *6.170625e-16≈5.7165e-17.

So total is 3.0853e-16 +5.7165e-17 = 3.65695e-16.

So overall, 3.702375e-15 + 3.65695e-16 = 4.06807e-15 meters.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Wait, 6.170625e-16 *6.5924 → 6.170625 *6.5924= let me compute that.

6.170625 *6 =37.02375

6.170625 *0.5924 → 6.170625 *0.5 =3.0853125, 6.170625 *0.0924= approx 0.571678125. So total for 0.5924 is 3.0853125 + 0.571678125 ≈3.656990625.

So 37.02375 + 3.656990625 =40.680740625.

So 40.680740625e-16 m → 4.0680740625e-15 meters.

So L ≈4.06807e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, my calculation is about 4.068e-15, which is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, let me recalculate the gamma and beta. Maybe I approximated too much.

gamma = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666666...

Beta = sqrt(1 – (1/gamma^2)).

So 1/gamma^2 = (1/6.666667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 – 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) → Let me compute that more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let's see:

0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 = 0.9604; 0.988^2= 0.976144. Hmm, 0.988^2 is 0.976144 which is less than 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887^2 → let's compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + 0.0087²

= 0.9604 + 0.017148 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017148 = 0.977548 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97762369.

So 0.9887^2 is about 0.9776, which is a bit higher than 0.9775, so sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 (since 0.9887^2 is 0.9776, so if I'm looking for sqrt(0.9775), it's a bit less. Let's say approximately 0.9886.

So beta is approximately 0.9886.

So gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

6 * 0.9886 = 5.9316

0.6667 * 0.9886 ≈ approx 0.6667 * 0.98 = 0.6534, 0.6667 *0.0086= approx 0.005734. So total 0.6534 + 0.005734 = 0.6591.

So 5.9316 + 0.6591 = 6.5907.

Wait, but earlier I had 6.5924. Hmm, perhaps I can be more precise.

But for the purposes of calculation, perhaps it's better to compute gamma * beta accurately.

Alternative approach: since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, but perhaps using the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So (pc)² = E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

Wait, but p = gamma m beta c.

Hmm, perhaps this approach can help find beta and gamma.

Alternatively, from E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m beta c.

So (p c) = gamma m beta c².

But (pc) = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So (p c) = 7.91 GeV.

Also, E = gamma m c² = 8 GeV.

From (p c) = gamma m beta c² → 7.91 = gamma m beta c².

But E = gamma m c² → gamma m c² =8 GeV.

So substituting into the equation:

7.91 = gamma m beta c² → 7.91 = (gamma m c²) * beta → 7.91 = 8 GeV * beta.

So beta = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta is 0.98875.

Then, gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666..., as before.

So gamma * beta = 6.666667 * 0.98875.

Calculating this:

6.666667 *0.98875 → let's compute.

First, 6 *0.98875 = 5.9325.

0.666667 *0.98875 ≈ 0.666667 * 1 = 0.666667; subtract 0.666667 *0.01125.

0.01125 is 0.01 + 0.00125.

0.666667 * 0.01 = 0.00666667.

0.666667 * 0.00125 = 0.000833333.

So total subtraction: 0.00666667 + 0.000833333 = 0.0075.

So 0.666667 * 0.98875 = 0.666667 - 0.0075 = 0.659167.

Adding to 5.9325 → 5.9325 + 0.659167 = 6.591667.

So gamma * beta ≈6.591667.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have c =3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.591667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

First, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625 → 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 6.591667:

6.170625e-16 *6.591667.

Compute 6.170625 *6.591667 ≈ let's calculate:

6 *6 =36, 6 *0.591667=3.55, 0.170625 *6=1.02375, 0.170625 *0.591667≈0.1008.

So adding up:

6*6 =36

6 *0.591667=3.55 → 36+3.55 =39.55

0.170625 *6 =1.02375 → 39.55 +1.02375=40.57375

0.170625 *0.591667≈0.1008 → 40.57375 +0.1008 ≈40.67455.

So 6.170625 *6.591667 ≈40.67455 → 40.67455e-16 m → 4.067455e-15 m.

So L ≈4.067455e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Hmm, why is there a slight discrepancy?

Let me check the calculation of tau again.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) e-25.

Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute that accurately.

0.32 × 20 =6.4. 6.582 -6.4=0.182.

0.182 /0.32 =0.56875.

So 20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should carry more precise decimal places in the calculations, but I think the given options are precise enough. So the answer is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma*beta.

Wait, another approach: let's compute gamma*beta as (E² - m² c^4) / (m c²) )^0.5.

Wait, actually, gamma*beta = (E² - m² c^4)^(1/2) / (m c^2) )

Because gamma = E/(m c²) and beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²) )

So gamma * beta = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/E^2 )

Which can also be written as sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / m^2 c^4 ) )

Which is sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) )/( m c^2 )

Wait, let me compute this:

E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV.

E^2 = 64 (GeV)^2.

m^2 c^4 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

So E^2 - m^2 c^4 =64 -1.44=62.56 (GeV)^2.

sqrt(62.56) =7.91 GeV.

So gamma * beta =7.91 GeV / 1.2 GeV =7.91/1.2 ≈6.591666...

Which matches our earlier calculation.

So gamma * beta is 6.591666...

So L=6.591666... * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

Compute c * tau: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591666...:

6.591666... *6.170625e-16 = let me compute 6.591666 *6.170625.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.591666 *6=3.55.

0.591666 *0.170625≈0.1008.

So 36 +1.02375=37.02375.

37.02375 +3.55=40.57375.

40.57375 +0.1008=40.67455.

So 40.67455e-16 m → 4.067455e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m. The closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but my calculation is 4.067e-15. The option B is 4.0655e-15. So it's very close but not exactly matching. Maybe I missed some precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of gamma*beta is more precise.

Wait, let me compute 7.91 / 1.2 more accurately.

7.91 divided by 1.2.

1.2 ×6=7.2 → 7.91 -7.2=0.71.

0.71 /1.2 → 0.591666...

So 6.591666... So it's exact.

Hmm, perhaps I should carry more precise decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.

6.5916666667 *6.170625 = ?

Let me calculate 6.5916666667 ×6.170625.

Compute 6 ×6.170625 =37.02375.

0.5916666667 ×6.170625 → approximately 0.5916666667 *6=3.55, 0.5916666667 *0.170625≈0.1008.

So 3.55 +0.1008=3.6508.

So total 37.02375 +3.6508=40.67455.

So same as before.

Hmm. So the answer is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which isn't exactly an option. The closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation of tau again.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → 20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me recompute L.

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

gamma*beta =6.5916666667.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Then, 6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6.5916666667 *6.170625.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 6 ×6.170625 =37.02375.

0.5916666667 ×6.170625.

Compute 0.5 ×6.170625 =3.0853125.

0.0916666667 ×6.170625.

Compute 0.09 ×6.170625=0.55535625.

0.0016666667 ×6.170625≈0.010284375.

So 0.55535625 +0.010284375 =0.565640625.

So 0.5916666667 ×6.170625≈3.0853125 +0.565640625=3.650953125.

So total is 37.02375 +3.650953125 =40.674703125.

So 40.674703125e-16 m →4.0674703125e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0675e-15 m.

Hmm, the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps more precise?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and c, but I think that the given options are in a specific format.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Wait, decay length formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, which is correct. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation of gamma * beta again.

Wait, using E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV/(1.2 GeV) =6.666666...

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/E^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887 approx.

So gamma * beta=6.666666... *0.9887≈6.591666...

So, L=6.591666... *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591666...:

6.170625e-16 *6.591666...=6.170625 *6.591666...e-16.

Calculate 6.170625 *6.591666...

6.170625 *6 =37.02375.

6.170625 *0.591666...= let me compute.

0.591666... is approximately 0.5916666667.

So 6.170625 *0.5916666667.

Compute 6 *0.5916666667=3.55.

0.170625 *0.5916666667 ≈0.1008.

So total of 3.55 +0.1008=3.6508.

So 6.170625 *6.591666...=37.02375 +3.6508=40.67455.

So 40.67455e-16 m →4.067455e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

A) 5.0223e-16 → too small.

B)4.0655e-15 → close to our result.

C)5.0223e-15 → also close but a bit bigger.

D)4.0655e-16 → too small.

So the correct answer should be B)4.0655e-15 m, but my calculation is 4.067e-15. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma*beta was more precise.

Wait, 7.91 GeV /1.2 GeV =6.5916666667.

So perhaps, if I compute 6.5916666667 ×6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6.170625 ×6.5916666667 = ?

Let me compute 6.170625 ×6.5916666667.

6.170625 ×6 =37.02375.

6.170625 ×0.5916666667 = ?

Let me compute 6.170625 ×0.5 =3.0853125.

6.170625 ×0.0916666667= ?

0.0916666667 is 11/120 ≈0.0916666667.

6.170625 ×0.0916666667.

Compute 6.170625 ×0.09=0.55535625.

6.170625 ×0.0016666667= approx 0.010284375.

So 0.55535625 +0.010284375=0.565640625.

So 0.5916666667 ×6.170625=3.0853125 +0.565640625=3.650953125.

So total 37.02375 +3.650953125=40.674703125.

Multiply by 1e-16 →40.674703125e-16 =4.0674703125e-15 m.

So about 4.0675e-15 m.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of tau?

Wait, let me recheck tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

So tau =6.582e-25 /0.32 =20.56875e-25 s →2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but perhaps the correct value of ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, so 6.582e-25.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the given options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).

But wait, another approach: the decay length can also be calculated using the formula L = (E * tau) / m.

Wait, because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²).

Beta c is the velocity, so (gamma beta c) = (E/(m c²)) * (v/c) c = (E v)/(m c²).

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating.

Wait, let me think: L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma * beta = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / (m c^2).

Which we have already computed as 6.591666....

So, 6.591666... * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591666... →40.6747e-16 m →4.06747e-15 m.

Hmm, which would be approximately 4.067e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation uses more precise values for ħ and c.

Let me check the exact value of ħ in GeV·s.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

But perhaps I should use more decimal places. Let me see:

ħ = 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Perhaps it's 6.5823×10^-25.

So, tau =6.5823e-25 /0.32= ?

6.5823 /0.32 = 20.5696875.

So tau =20.5696875e-25 s →2.05696875e-24 s.

That's a slight increase from previous 2.056875e-24.

So, c*tau =3e8 *2.05696875e-24 =6.17090625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma*beta=6.5916666667.

6.5916666667 *6.17090625e-16.

Compute 6.5916666667 ×6.17090625.

Again, let's compute:

6 ×6.17090625=37.0254375.

0.5916666667 ×6.17090625 →3.650953125.

So 37.0254375 +3.650953125=40.676390625.

So 40.676390625e-16 m →4.0676390625e-15 m.

Still, the closest option remains B)4.0655e-15.

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation is done with more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps I should use natural units differently.

Wait, an alternative approach: Compute L = (E * tau)/(m c) → because gamma*beta*c = (E/(m c^2)) * (v) → but maybe it's easier.

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c².

So, gamma =8/(1.2 c^2) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula L = (E * tau) / (m c).

Wait, let me see: L = (gamma m c^2) * (tau) / (m c) ) = gamma c tau.

Wait, but that's not correct because gamma beta c tau is the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mean decay length formula which is L = (v gamma) c tau.

Wait, v gamma = gamma beta c.

So, L = (gamma beta c) * tau.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any errors in my calculations, but perhaps the intended answer is option C)5.0223e-15 m, which is about 5e-15, but my calculation is around 4e-15, which is option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²) → but m c² is 1.2 GeV, so E is 8 GeV, so gamma=8/1.2=6.666666..., correct.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma*beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Gamma=8/(1.2)=20/3=6.6666666667.

Beta=sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2))= sqrt(1 - (1.44/64))=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988680371.

So gamma*beta=6.6666666667 *0.988680371.

6.6666666667 *0.988680371.

Let me compute:

6 *0.988680371=5.932082226.

0.6666666667 *0.988680371=0.659120247.

So total is 5.932082226 +0.659120247=6.591202473.

So gamma*beta=6.591202473.

So L=6.591202473 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591202473.

6.591202473 *6.170625e-16=6.591202473 *6.170625= let's compute this.

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.591202473×6.170625.

Compute 0.5 ×6.170625=3.0853125.

0.091202473 ×6.170625.

0.09 ×6.170625=0.55535625.

0.001202473 ×6.170625 ≈0.00740606.

So 0.55535625 +0.00740606 ≈0.56276231.

So 0.591202473×6.170625≈3.0853125 +0.56276231=3.64807481.

So total L=37.02375 +3.64807481=40.67182481.

So 40.67182481e-16 m →4.067182481e-15 m.

Hmm, which is about 4.0672e-15 m.

Again, the closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using a different value for ħ. Sometimes, ħ is taken as approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps using a different value would change the result slightly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute tau as (ħ)/(Γ c^2) ?

Wait, no, because Γ is in energy units, and ħ has units of energy × time. So tau is ħ/(Γ), with ħ in GeV·s and Γ in GeV.

Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another thought. Gamma is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau=ħ/(Γ). But perhaps in some contexts, it's tau=2ħ/(Γ), but I think that's when considering the Breit-Wigner distribution's width as the full width at half maximum, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the relation between the width Γ and the lifetime is Γ = ħ / tau.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that's correct. But perhaps sometimes, people use Γ = ħ / (2 tau) ?

Wait, no, the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2 for energy and time uncertainty, but when Γ is the total decay width, the lifetime is tau=ħ/Γ.

So I think that part is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)5.0223e-15 m, but that's larger. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for decay length is L= gamma * beta * c * tau.

But perhaps I should consider that the production energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, the question says production energy is 8 GeV. That is, is E the total energy or the kinetic energy?

Ah, this is a crucial point. I assumed E is the total energy, but if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kinetic + m c^2.

Wait, the problem states "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". What does production energy refer to?

In particle physics, the production energy usually refers to the total energy of the particle. So I think my initial assumption was correct.

But if E was kinetic energy, then E_total = E_kinetic + m c^2 =8 GeV +1.2 GeV =9.2 GeV.

Then, gamma would be E_total/(m c^2)=9.2/1.2≈7.6667.

Beta would be sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E_total^2)).

E_total^2 = (9.2)^2=84.64.

m^2 c^4=1.44.

So 1 - 1.44/84.64=1-0.01699=0.98301.

sqrt(0.98301)= approx 0.99148.

So gamma*beta=7.6667 *0.99148≈7.6.

So L=7.6 *3e8 m/s * tau.

Tau=6.582e-25 /0.32≈2.056875e-24 s.

c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 7.6: 7.6 *6.170625e-16=46.774e-16 m=4.6774e-15 m.

That's larger than option C)5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but this would be the case if E was kinetic energy. However, the problem states production energy E_X=8 GeV, which is likely the total energy.

So, perhaps this is not the case.

So, I think the correct approach is as I did before, leading to L≈4.067e-15 m.

But the options don't have that exact value. The closest option is B)4.0655e-15 m.

But perhaps I should consider the precise calculation with more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a mistake. But given the options, the closest is B.

So, I'll go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E \) is the total energy of the particle and \( m \) is its mass. Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5917.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma \beta = 6.5917 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 6.5917 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Then, multiply by \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} = 40.6747 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.0675 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated decay length is approximately \( 4.0675 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). The closest option is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
