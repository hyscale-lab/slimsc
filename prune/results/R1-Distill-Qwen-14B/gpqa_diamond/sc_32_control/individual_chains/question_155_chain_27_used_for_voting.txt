Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt⟨ψ|P²|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|P|ψ⟩², right? So I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared. Then take that into the formula.

But wait, the state is given for P_x's eigenstate. Since P_x and P_z might not commute, I can't be sure that the state is also an eigenstate of P_z. So I can't directly say the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. I'll have to compute it explicitly.

Let me think about the matrices. The matrices are given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So the basis is such that P_z is diagonal. The given state is in this basis. So the state vector is already expressed in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. That's helpful.

Wait, the state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ a; b; c ] where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is simply the sum of |c_i|² * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues of P_z corresponding to each basis vector.

Looking at the P_z matrix, it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I'll compute |a|² * ħ + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ). Let's calculate each term.

First, |a|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So that's 1/4 * ħ.

|b|² is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. But since the middle eigenvalue is zero, that term contributes nothing.

|c|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding these gives (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix for P_z squared would be (ħ², 0, 0), 0 in the middle, and ( (-ħ)^2 )= ħ² in the third position.

Wait, no, P_z squared matrix would actually be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0, (−ħ)^2 ]

So which is [ħ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, ħ²].

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|² * ħ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ħ².

Wait, but the second term is zero again because the middle element in P_z squared is zero.

So |a|² is 1/4, so 1/4 * ħ².

|c|² is 1/4, so 1/4 * ħ².

So together, (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, that's option B, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a moment, did I make any mistake here? Let me double-check. The state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's correct to just sum |c_i|² * λ_i. Since the state is a mixture of the first and third eigenstates, each with 1/4 and 1/4 probabilities, they cancel each other out. So yes, the expectation is zero.

And for P_z squared, each contributes (ħ²)(1/4) twice, so ½ ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt(½ ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively.

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (1/4) \cdot \hbar + (1/2) \cdot 0 + (1/4) \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with entries $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ (since $(-\hbar)^2 = \hbar^2$). Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = 1/4$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4) \cdot \hbar^2 + (1/2) \cdot 0 + (1/4) \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
