Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies. I need to find which pair is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That means the magnitudes of their momenta are the same, but their directions are opposite.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, right? Or at least, in many problems, we consider neutrinos to have negligible mass. I think that's the case here. So the neutrino's energy would just be equal to its momentum. Because for massless particles, E = pc.

The muon, on the other hand, has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. So its energy will be the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and momentum as p. The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p.

Conservation of energy says that the total energy before decay (which is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary) equals the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino after decay.

So, E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c². But since we're looking for kinetic energy, KE_mu = (gamma - 1) m_mu c².

But wait, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about the energies. The neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c², but since we're working in MeV units where c=1, it's sqrt(p² + m_mu²). So E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2).

So putting it together:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, I can solve this equation for p. Let me rearrange it:

Let me denote sqrt(p² + 105.7²) as A.

So, 139.6 = A + p.

But A = sqrt(p² + 105.7²).

Hmm, maybe square both sides. Let me try that.

Let me subtract p from both sides: A = 139.6 - p.

Then square both sides: p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So the equation becomes:

p² + (105.7)^2 = 139.6² - 2 *139.6 * p + p².

Wait, the p² terms cancel out on both sides.

So,

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 *139.6 * p.

Rearranging:

2 *139.6 * p = 139.6² - 105.7².

Let me compute the right-hand side. 139.6 squared is... let me calculate:

139.6 * 139.6: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7 squared: 100^2 is 10000; 5.7^2 is 32.49; and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So 139.6² - 105.7² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 *139.6 * p = 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6).

Let me compute denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Approximately, 279.2 * 29 is 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2=8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 29 *279.2=8096.8. But 8315.67 is a bit higher.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 8315.67 is 8376-60.33= 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * x = 8315.67. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see: 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 30 minus (8376-8315.67)/279.2.

The difference is 8376 -8315.67=60.33.

So 60.33 / 279.2 ≈ 0.216.

So x ≈30 - 0.216 = 29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, units. Since E is in MeV, and for neutrino, E = pc, so p in MeV/c. So p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

Then, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2).

Let me compute p²: (29.784)^2 = approx 29.78^2 is about 886.7 (since 30^2=900, so 29.78^2= ~887. Let me compute 29.784 *29.784.

29.784 *29.784:

I'll compute 29 *29 =841.

29 *0.784=22.736.

0.784 *29=22.736.

0.784 *0.784≈0.614.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 29.784^2 as (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 ≈ 887.086656.

So p² ≈887.086656.

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = p² + m_mu^2 ≈ 887.086656 + 11172.49 ≈12059.576.

E_mu = sqrt(12059.576)= let me compute sqrt(12059.576).

Hmm, 110^2=12100. So sqrt(12059.576) is a bit less than 110. Let's compute 109.8^2= (110-0.2)^2= 110² - 2*110*0.2 +0.2²=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

Wait, E_mu^2 is 12059.576, which is 12056.04 +3.536. So E_mu is approximately 109.8 + (3.536/(2*109.8)).

Because the derivative of x^2 is 2x, so delta_x ≈ delta/(2x).

So delta is 3.536. x is 109.8. So delta_x≈3.536/(2*109.8) ≈3.536/219.6 ≈0.0161.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.0161≈109.816 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Let me check the options. Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Wait, but neutrino's energy is p, which we found to be approximately 29.784 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV. So the KE of the product particles. But wait, the neutrino's energy is all kinetic since it's massless, right? Because for a massless particle, E=pc, and rest mass is zero, so the entire energy is kinetic. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.

So the two KEs would be 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Let me recalculate the initial equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

We solved for p and found p≈29.78 MeV.

Then, E_mu = sqrt(29.78² +105.7²)= sqrt(886.7 +11172.49)=sqrt(12059.19)=109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu =109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV, which is about 4.12 as in option D.

So the KEs are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

A)2.84,26.8

B)7.2,32.8

C)3.52,20.8

D)4.12,29.8.

So option D matches.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy is its rest mass, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon's kinetic energy is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV. So total KE is 4.12 +29.8=33.92 MeV. But let me check the total energy.

The muon's energy is 105.7 +4.12 =109.82 MeV. Neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV. So total energy is 109.82 +29.8=139.62 MeV, which matches the pion's rest mass. So that checks out.

Wait, but wait a second. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7. So the total rest mass after decay is 105.7 +0 (neutrino's rest mass). So the kinetic energies must account for the difference: 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV. So the sum of the KEs should be 33.9 MeV. 4.12 +29.8=33.92, which is correct.

So yes, option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Given:**
- The stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) decays into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)).
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

**Key principles:**
1. Conservation of energy: The total energy before decay equals the total energy after decay.
2. Conservation of momentum: Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

### Step 1: Energy conservation
The total energy of the system before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_{\nu}\)):
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's total energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_{\nu} = p\)) because it is massless.

Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(p\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the muon's total energy
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.08 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the muon's kinetic energy
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu^+}.
\]
\[
KE_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Neutrino's energy
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 6: Verify energy conservation
The total energy after decay is:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 109.82 + 29.78 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV},
\]
which matches the total energy before decay. The calculations are consistent.

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's energy is \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). These values match **Option D**.
