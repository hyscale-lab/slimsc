Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I'm given the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The answer options give different possible eigenvectors, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Hmm. I remember that the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices and the direction vector. So the operator P is the spin operator along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since P is a spin-1/2 operator, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So first, I need to express the operator P as n·(P_x, P_y, P_z), right? Because the operator for spin along a direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix (or in this case, the given matrices for Px, Py, Pz). So I think the general form is P = nx Px + nz Pz, since the direction is in the x-z plane (so ny=0).

Each of the components Px, Py, Pz is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So let me write down each part.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P along n is:
P = nx * Px + nz * Pz

Substituting the matrices:

P = (nx (ħ/2))[[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (nz (ħ/2))[[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So combining the terms, P becomes:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me check that. The first term for the diagonal elements is nz*(ħ/2), so the (1,1) element is nz*(ħ/2). The off-diagonal terms are nx*(ħ/2) for both (1,2) and (2,1). And the (2,2) element is (-nz)(ħ/2).

So the matrix for P is:

[[nz, nx],
 [nx, -nz]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector |v> such that P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which can be written as (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Substituting P:

(ħ/2) [ [nz - 1, nx], [nx, -nz - 1] ] |v> = 0.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The matrix for (P - λ I), where λ is the eigenvalue, is:

For each component, subtract λ times the identity matrix. So for each diagonal element, it's (nz * ħ/2) - (ħ/2)*1, and similarly for the others.

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix of P is (ħ/2) times [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. So when we subtract (ħ/2) times the identity matrix, the diagonal elements become nz*(ħ/2) - ħ/2 * 1 = (nz -1) ħ/2. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (-nz)*(ħ/2) - ħ/2 *1 = (-nz -1) ħ/2. The off-diagonal elements remain nx*(ħ/2).

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ (nz -1) ħ/2, nx ħ/2 ],
  [ nx ħ/2, (-nz -1) ħ/2 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0.

Since ħ/2 is a common factor, we can factor it out and the equation reduces to:

[ [ nz-1, nx ],
  [ nx, -nz-1 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0.

So setting up the two equations:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations in two variables (v1 and v2). For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. But since we're looking for the eigenvector, we can use one equation to express v2 in terms of v1, or vice versa.

Let me take the first equation:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0 → v2 = [(1 - nz)/(nx)] v1.

Wait, but I think it's better to parameterize in terms of the direction vector. The direction vector n is in x-z plane, so it's (n_x, 0, n_z). But since the direction is arbitrary, we can describe it using polar coordinates, perhaps. Let me define the angle θ such that n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ. Because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ. That makes sense.

So substituting nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ into the equations.

So equation 1 becomes:

(sinθ -1) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0 → v2 = [ (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] v1.

Hmm. Let me see if I can find a general expression for v1 and v2 in terms of θ.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to note that the eigenstates for spin-½ along an arbitrary direction are given by the spin matrices. The eigenstates for +½ are:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |−z>

But in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero, because the direction is along x and z, which would imply that the state is in the x-z plane, so the azimuthal angle φ is zero. So the state simplifies.

Wait, but that's only if the direction is in the x-z plane, right? Because the general case includes any direction, but here since n is in x-z, φ is zero. So the eigenstate for +1/2 would be cos(θ/2) |↑z> + sin(θ/2) |↓z>, where |↑z> is [1; 0] and |↓z> is [0; 1].

Wait, let me think. The spin-up state along direction n is:

|+n> = e^{-iφ/2} [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

But since φ is zero (because n is in the x-z plane), this simplifies to:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that's for a state in the x-z plane. Or perhaps I'm mixing this up.

Wait, cos(theta) would be the x-component of the unit vector, and sin(theta) the z-component.

Wait, another approach: let's find the eigenvector by solving the equation.

We have the matrix:

[[nz -1, nx ],
 [nx, -nz -1 ] ]

Which must be multiplied by the eigenvector [v1, v2]^T to give zero.

So the first equation is (nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0.

Let me write this as (nz -1) v1 = - nx v2.

The second equation is nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 = 0 → nx v1 = (nz +1) v2.

Wait, substituting v2 from the first equation into the second.

From the first equation: v2 = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] v1.

Substituting into the second equation:

nx v1 + (-nz -1) * [ (1-nz)/nx ] v1 = 0.

Multiply through by nx to eliminate the denominator:

nx^2 v1 + (-nz -1)(1 - nz) v1 =0.

Since v1 is not zero (non-trivial solution), we can divide by v1:

nx^2 + (-nz -1)(1 - nz) ) = 0.

Compute (-nz -1)(1 -nz) = (-nz)(1 -nz) -1 (1 -nz) = (-nz + nz^2) - (1 -nz) )

= -nz + nz^2 -1 + nz.

Simplify: -nz +nz cancels, leaving nz^2 -1.

So the equation becomes:

nx^2 + (nz^2 - 1) = 0.

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), substituting:

1 - nz^2 + nz^2 -1 = 0 → 0=0, which is always true.

So the equations are consistent, and the eigenvectors can be found by using one equation to express v2 in terms of v1.

From the first equation: v2 = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] v1.

Let me choose v1 = sqrt( something ) to normalize the vector.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of θ. Since nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

So substituting:

v2 = [ (1 - sinθ) / cosθ ] v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, (1 - sinθ)/(cosθ) v1 ]^T.

Let me factor out v1:

[1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

But I can factor this further. Let's write it as:

v1 [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

Wait, perhaps expressing it in terms of tan(theta/2) would help. Because 1 - sinθ can be expressed as (something involving tan(theta/2)).

Wait, 1 - sinθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2 - pi/4) ? Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me recall that:

1 - sinθ = (sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2))^2.

Alternatively, I can write (1 - sinθ)/cosθ as [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Wait, but perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me compute (1 - sinθ) = (sin(pi/2) - sinθ) = 2 cos( (pi/4 + theta/2 )) sin( (pi/4 - theta/2 )).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, I can use the identity:

(1 - sinθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 - pi/4), but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me consider the expression (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

= [ (1 - sin^2θ) ] / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ]
= [ cos^2θ ] / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] 
= cosθ / (1 + sinθ )

So (1 - sinθ)/cosθ = cosθ/(1 + sinθ).

So v2 = [ cosθ / (1 + sinθ) ] v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [1; cosθ/(1 + sinθ) ] times v1.

But perhaps it's better to write this in terms of sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2).

Hmm. Another approach: let's express this as a ratio. Let me write the components as:

v1 = A,

v2 = A * (1 - sinθ) / cosθ.

But perhaps to make it easier, let's choose v1 = cos(theta/2), and then see what v2 would be.

Wait, maybe the eigenvector components can be written in terms of theta/2. Let me think: perhaps it's expressed as cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio v2/v1 is (1 - sinθ)/cosθ. Let me see what that ratio is.

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Let me compute this for specific angles to see a pattern. For example, when theta is 0, then cos0=1, sin0=0. So ratio is (1-0)/1=1. So v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector would be [1; 1], which when normalized would be [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Which makes sense because along the x-axis, the spin-up state is (1,1)/sqrt(2).

When theta is pi/2 (along z-axis), sin(theta)=1. So (1 - 1)/cos(pi/2) → 0/0, which is undefined. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the parametrization in terms of theta and phi. Since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero, but perhaps the state can be written as:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Since phi is zero, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is option C. Wait, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but what about normalization?

Wait, the norm would be cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

But wait, wait. Let me check if this satisfies the eigenvalue equation.

Let me compute P |v> and see if it equals (ħ/2) |v>.

The state |v> is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

The operator P is (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Substituting nz = sinθ, nx = cosθ.

P = (ħ/2) [ [ sinθ, cosθ ],
             [ cosθ, -sinθ ] ]

So applying P to |v>:

P |v> = (ħ/2) [ sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2),
                cosθ cos(theta/2) - sinθ sin(theta/2) ].

Hmm, let's compute these terms.

First component:

sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2).

Wait, I can factor this as sin(theta/2) [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] + cos(theta/2) [ (1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me note that:

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2),
cos(theta) = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2).

So first component:

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + [cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2)

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) + [ (cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) ) ] sin(theta/2 )

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin^3(theta/2)

= (2 cos^2(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) ) sin(theta/2) - sin^3(theta/2)

= 3 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin^3(theta/2)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's compute the matrix product:

P |v> = (ħ/2) [ sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2),
                cosθ cos(theta/2) - sinθ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, perhaps using angle addition formulas.

Looking at the first component:

sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta + theta/2) ?

No, wait, sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So if A = theta and B = theta/2, then it's sin(theta + theta/2) = sin(3theta/2).

Similarly, the second component is cos(theta) cos(theta/2) - sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta + theta/2) = cos(3 theta/2).

So P |v> = (ħ/2) [ sin(3θ/2), cos(3θ/2) ].

Hmm, but for this to be equal to (ħ/2) |v>, we need:

[ sin(3θ/2) , cos(3θ/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which would only be true if 3θ/2 = theta/2 + 2π k, but that's not generally true. So this suggests that my initial assumption might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Or perhaps I should consider the eigenvalue equation again.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the state being an eigenvector of the operator. Let me think again about the state.

Another method: The operator P is given along n in x-z plane. The eigenstates for spin in direction n are known. The spin-up state |+n> can be written as:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But since in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero. So,

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is option C.

But when I applied this to P, it didn't yield the correct eigenvalue. Hmm, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the application of P.

Let me write the state |v> as [a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

The operator P is (ħ/2) [ [sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, -sinθ] ]

So P |v> would be (ħ/2) [ sinθ a + cosθ b, cosθ a - sinθ b ]

Substituting a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), we get:

First component: sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2)
Second component: cosθ cos(theta/2) - sinθ sin(theta/2)

Hmm, let's compute the first term again:

sinθ cos(theta/2) + cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta + theta/2) = sin(3θ/2)

Similarly, the second component is cos(theta + theta/2) = cos(3θ/2).

So P |v> = (ħ/2) [ sin(3θ/2), cos(3θ/2) ]

We want P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So, we have:

sin(3θ/2) = cos(theta/2)
cos(3θ/2) = sin(theta/2)

Is this identity true for all theta?

Wait, let me consider θ = 0.

At theta=0: sin(0) =0, cos(0)=1.

So sin(3*0/2)=0, which equals cos(0/2)=1? No, 0 !=1. So this doesn't hold.

This suggests that the state [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is not an eigenvector of P. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize the state in terms of the direction of n. Since n is in x-z plane, its direction can be described using an angle theta from the z-axis. So for example, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, that's a different convention. Alternatively, perhaps in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle, so n has components (sinθ cosphi, sinθ sinphi, cosθ). But since phi is zero (n is in x-z plane), n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, that would be for polar angle theta from the z-axis. So when theta=0, n points along z (since sin0=0, cos0=1). When theta=90 degrees, n points along x (sin90=1, cos90=0).

Wait, maybe I should adjust the parametrization. Let me let theta be the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

Wait, that might make more sense. So let me try that.

So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

Now, substituting into the equation v2 = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] v1.

So v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

I can simplify (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as [v1, tan(theta/2) v1 ].

We can factor out v1:

v1 [1; tan(theta/2) ].

To normalize this vector, the sum of the squares should equal 1.

So |v1|^2 (1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = 1 → |v1|^2 (sec^2(theta/2)) ) =1 → |v1|=cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is:

v1 = cos(theta/2) [1; tan(theta/2) ]

Which can be written as:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the second component is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait, but earlier when I tried this, the eigenvalue didn't match. Did I make a mistake in that calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate applying P to this vector.

The operator P is (ħ/2) times [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ], and with nz = cosθ, nx = sinθ.

So P = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

The state |v> is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So P |v> = (ħ/2) [ cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2),
                  sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, the first component is cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2).

Using the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So this is cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

The second component: sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So P |v> = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = (ħ/2) |v> → which is correct.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I think I used the wrong parametrization of nx and nz. Earlier, I took nx = cos(theta), nz = sin(theta), but perhaps I should have taken nx = sin(theta), nz = cos(theta), which makes more sense when theta is the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis.

So the correct eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, let me check all the options again.

Option C says: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That's exactly what I have.

But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta) → this doesn't match what we have.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) — but the hbar shouldn't be there, as the eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Option A: includes hbar, which isn't correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from the given components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and the direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized by an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, with $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**: The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (P_x, P_y, P_z)$. Substituting $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ and the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P}$ is:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is $\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$. This leads to the system of equations:
   \[
   \left[\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
   \end{bmatrix}\right] \begin{bmatrix}
   v_1 \\
   v_2
   \end{bmatrix} = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**: From the equations, the ratio of the components of the eigenvector is found to be:
   \[
   v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
   \]
   The eigenvector can thus be written as:
   \[
   |v\rangle = v_1 \begin{bmatrix}
   1 \\
   \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = 1$. Substituting $v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1$, we find:
   \[
   v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad v_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
   \]
   Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\
   \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Verification**: Applying $\vec{P}$ to this eigenvector confirms that it satisfies the eigenvalue equation $\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Does not match the derived eigenvector and introduces unnecessary phase factors.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes incorrect normalization factors and unnecessary $\hbar$ terms.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
