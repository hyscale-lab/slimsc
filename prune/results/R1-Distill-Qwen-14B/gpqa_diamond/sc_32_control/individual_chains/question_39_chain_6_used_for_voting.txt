Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions in quantum mechanics should have certain properties, right? Like, they need to be normalized. Oh yeah, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. That makes sense because probabilities add up to 1.

The particles can only be found between x=1 and x=3. So when they measured, all particles were there, meaning the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Does that mean it's non-zero only between 1 and 3? Or is there more to it?

Wait, maybe the wave function is given for the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. Because the problem says when measuring, none were found outside that range. So the wave function is zero outside, but in the region x=1 to x=3, it's that given function.

But wait, if the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i in the valid region, does that mean it's a complex wave function? Because the square of the absolute value gives the probability density. So I'll need to find the normalization constant 'a' such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me write the wave function as ψ(x) = A / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i, where A is 'a'. But wait, no, the entire function is (a/sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 +x)) + (-0.5)i. To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is ψ*(x) ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate. So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i, because the complex conjugate of i is -i.

Wait, let me compute ψ*(x) ψ(x):

[(a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when taking the conjugate, the imaginary part flips sign. So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So when I multiply them:

(a / sqrt(1+x))² + (a / sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the identity (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but wait, in this case, they're not exact conjugates. Let me think again.

Wait, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i.
So ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)i.

So when I multiply them:

[(a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)i] * [(a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i] 

Which is (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) ?

Wait, no, maybe I should expand it properly. Let me compute each term.

Multiply term by term:

First term: (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) = a² / (1 + x).

Second term: (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) = -0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).

Third term: (0.5i) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) = 0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).

Fourth term: (0.5i) * (-0.5i) = -0.25 i².

So when I add all four terms:

a²/(1+x) + (-0.5ia/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5ia/sqrt(1+x)) ) + ( -0.25 i² )

The middle terms cancel out because they are opposites. So we're left with a²/(1+x) - 0.25 i².

But since i² = -1, that becomes a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = [ a²/(1+x) ] + 0.25.

Wait, is that correct? Because in the expansion, the cross terms are imaginary and cancel each other, leaving only the first and the last terms. The last term is -0.25 i², which is -0.25*(-1) = +0.25.

So the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. Interesting.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

So let's set up the equation:

Integral from 1 to 3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let's compute each part.

First integral: ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that:

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That's close. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which requires that the total probability of finding the particle within the region \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x)
\]

Taking the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \), we get:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \( \psi^*(x) \) and \( \psi(x) \), the cross terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + 0.25
\]

Thus:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.
