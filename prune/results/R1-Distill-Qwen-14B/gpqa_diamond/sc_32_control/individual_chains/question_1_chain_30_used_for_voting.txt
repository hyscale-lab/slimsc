Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options given are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime (or time) of a particle simultaneously. The principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, so the idea here is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the lifetime (Δt) is roughly on the order of ħ. So if the lifetimes are given, the uncertainty in energy would be inversely proportional to the lifetime. Longer lifetime means lower energy uncertainty and vice versa.

So each state has its own uncertainty. The first state has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, the second state has τ2 = 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2).

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is too small, their uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them. So for clear resolution, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Let me compute these uncertainties. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the energy options are in eV, I should convert everything into eV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE = ħ/(2τ). For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, wait a second. So the energy uncertainty for the first state is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for the second state, it's about 3.29e-8 eV. So the total uncertainty would be the sum of these two, because when you're looking at the difference between E1 and E2, the uncertainty in each would add up. Or maybe not? Because the energy difference is E2 - E1, but each has their own uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the measurement of the energy difference. If the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties, the uncertainty in the difference would be the square root of the sum of squares, but if one uncertainty is much larger than the other, the larger one dominates.

Wait, let's see. The uncertainty in E1 is about 3.3e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is 3.3e-8 eV. So the combined uncertainty when measuring the difference E2-E1 would be sqrt( (3.3e-7)^2 + (3.3e-8)^2 ) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV, because (3.3e-8) is much smaller than (3.3e-7), so its square is negligible.

So the minimal energy difference ΔE that can be resolved should be larger than this total uncertainty. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than approximately 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.3e-7. So no, this would not be distinguishable.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so definitely not.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is about 1e-4. 3.3e-7 is 3.3e-7, so 1e-4 is much larger. So yes, this would be distinguishable.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.00000001 eV. 3.3e-7 is 0.00000033 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7. So not enough to resolve.

Wait, wait. Let me compute again. Wait, no: 1e-8 is 10^-8, which is 0.00000001. 3.3e-7 is 0.00000033. So 3.3e-7 is bigger than 1e-8. So the energy difference needs to be bigger than 3.3e-7 eV. So option C is 1e-4, which is 1e-4=1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 3.3e-7 (0.00000033 eV). So that's definitely larger. So option C would be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says, "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference.

Wait, but the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in E2 is about 3.3e-8 eV, and in E1, 3.3e-7 eV. So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the root sum square of these.

So uncertainty in E_diff ≈ sqrt( (3.3e-7)^2 + (3.3e-8)^2 ) ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than about 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 / 3.3e-7 ≈ about 300 times larger. So definitely, that's detectable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 3.3e-7, so that would not be resolvable.

Wait, but the question asks for which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct option would be the one where the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) and option A (1e-9 eV) are possible choices.

Wait, option A is 1e-9, which is 0.000000001 eV. That's way smaller than 3.3e-7 eV, which is 0.00000033 eV. So option A is way too small.

Wait, so option C is 1e-4 eV (0.0001 eV), which is way larger than the uncertainty of 3.3e-7. So that's definitely resolvable.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Using this, we calculate the energy uncertainties for the two states:

1. For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = E_2 - E_1 \) is the root sum square of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]
Since \( \Delta E_2 \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), the uncertainty is dominated by \( \Delta E_1 \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than this uncertainty. Now, we evaluate the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot be resolved.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). It can be clearly resolved.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
