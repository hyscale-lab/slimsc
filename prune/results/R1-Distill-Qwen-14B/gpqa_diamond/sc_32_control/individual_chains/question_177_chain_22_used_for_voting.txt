Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh wait, that's Wien's Law, right? So Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2?

Wait, but if they have the same temperature, how does that affect their luminosities? Oh right, the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, in this case, R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 equals T2. So let me plug that into the luminosity equation. L1 = 4π(R1)^2 σ T1^4 and L2 = 4π(R2)^2 σ T2^4. Since T1 = T2, T2 is just T1, so L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T1^4) which simplifies to (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, that ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but the question also mentions something about radial velocities. Oh right, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity calculation? Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So maybe the radial velocity is a red herring here, or perhaps it affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift is already accounted for, and the temperatures are the same as per their rest frames.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed temperature or something else. Let me think. The peak wavelength observed would be affected by the star's motion. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But in this case, Star_1's velocity is zero, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps Star_2's light is Doppler shifted, but the peak as observed is the same. So maybe the actual temperatures are different because of the Doppler effect, but the observed λ_max is same.

Wait, but the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation directly because they're using the observed λ_max to find the temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me go through the problem again. The problem says that the astronomers used spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they're the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. But according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. But if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their observed λ_max would change due to Doppler shift.

So, let me model this. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. Would that affect the observed λ_max? Because the star's actual temperature would be different. Imagine without Doppler shift, λ_max is 1/T. But with a Doppler shift, λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) approximately, but for non-relativistic speeds, it's λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) or something like that, but depends on direction.

Wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer (negative if moving away). But in this case, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1 = λ1_rest. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, let's say it's moving towards us, so v_r is -700 km/s. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + (v_r / c)). Wait, or is it (1 + v_r / c) when moving away, and (1 - v_r / c) when moving towards? Wait, let me clarify.

The Doppler formula for light when the source is moving towards the observer is: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, the approximate formula (for small beta) is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 - v/c). So if the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c). If moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

So in this problem, Star_1's λ_max is λ1_rest. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards us, so v_r is -700. So λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest (1 - (700,000 m/s)/c ). Wait, but 700 km/s is 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So 0.00233 is about 0.23% of c. So the approximation is valid.

But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But λ1_obs is λ1_rest, since Star_1's radial velocity is zero. So λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - v_r2 / c ). Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, its λ_obs is smaller than λ_rest. But the problem says the observed λ_max for both is the same. So λ1_rest must be equal to λ2_obs. But λ2_obs is λ2_rest * (1 - v_r2 / c ), assuming it's moving towards us.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then v_r is positive 700, so λ2_obs would be longer than λ2_rest. But Star_1's λ1_rest is the same as λ2_obs. So if Star_2 is moving away, then Star_2's observed λ_max would be longer than its rest frame. But if they are same as Star_1's λ_max, which is the same as its rest frame, then Star_2's rest frame λ_max must be shorter than observed λ_max. Because moving away would cause λ_obs to be longer. Wait, no, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ would be longer than its rest frame. But the problem says Star_1 and Star_2 have the same observed λ_max. Thus, for Star_2, observed λ equals Star_1's λ_rest.

So let's model this. Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0)
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c ), assuming v2_r is positive (moving away). Because if moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ). So, if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ is longer. But the problem states that both have the same observed λ_max, so λ2_obs = λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

We can rearrange this to find the ratio of their rest wavelengths.

Let me compute v2_r = 700 km/s. Let's compute v2_r / c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 is 7/(3000) = approx 0.002333.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ λ2_rest * 1.002333.

Which implies λ2_rest ≈ λ1_rest / 1.002333 ≈ λ1_rest * (1 - 0.002327).

But wait, perhaps a more precise approach would be better. Let's actually compute (1 + v/c ) as an exact factor.

But perhaps it's easier to express the temperatures.

From Wien's law:

λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898e-3 m·K).

So,

λ1_rest = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2

But from the observed λ_max relation,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

Substituting,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r/c )

Because T1 = T2 * 1/(1 + v_r / c ), approximately.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise.

Wait, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), but only when the source is moving away. If the source is moving towards, it's λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v_r / c ). But in this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is same.

So, Star_1 has λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c ), assuming v2_r is positive (moving away).

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

so,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

But λ1_rest = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2_r/c )

Then,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r/c )

But v2_r is 700 km/s, so v2_r/c = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e2 /3e8 = 7/3e6 = approximately 0.0002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.0002332 )

Wait, that's a very small difference. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, that's a very minor change. So the temperatures are almost the same, but T1 is a bit lower than T2.

Wait, but how does this affect their luminosities?

Because L = 4πσ R² T⁴. So,

L1 = 4πσ (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4.

L2 = 4πσ R2^2 T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

But from earlier,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2_r/c ) = 1 / 1.0002333 ≈ 0.9997667.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 ≈ (0.9997667)^4.

Let me compute this.

0.9997667 is approximately 1 - 0.0002333.

The fourth power can be approximated as (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x + 6x² -4x³ + x^4. But since x is small, the higher terms can be ignored. So,

(0.9997667)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.0002333) = 1 - 0.0009333 = 0.9990667.

But let me compute it more accurately. Maybe use logarithms.

Wait,

(0.9997667)^4 = e^(4 * ln(0.9997667)).

ln(0.9997667) ≈ -0.0002333 (using the approximation ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x).

So,

4 * ln(0.9997667) ≈ 4 * (-0.0002333) = -0.0009333.

e^-0.0009333 ≈ 1 - 0.0009333 = 0.9990667.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9990667.

Therefore,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9990667 ≈ 2.248.

Wait, that's approximately 2.25. But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So, 2.248 is very close to 2.25, which is option A.

But wait a second, did I get the Doppler effect correct? Because I assumed that Star_2 is moving away, which would mean that its observed wavelength is longer, but the problem says that the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So what if Star_2 is moving towards us? That would make λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v_r / c ), so that would be a shorter wavelength.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v_r / c ). But according to the problem, λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 - v_r / c )

Which would give:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 - v_r/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - v_r / c )

But v_r is 700 km/s, so (v_r/c) is 0.0002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.0002333 ) ≈ T2 * (1 + 0.0002333 )

Because 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 +x for small x.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 * 1.0002333.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 1.0002333.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.0002333) = 1.0009333.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0009333 ≈ 2.252.

Which is approximately 2.25, same as earlier.

Wait, but this is a bit confusing. Because depending on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away, the temperature ratio changes. But in either case, the change is minuscule, so the luminosity ratio remains approximately 2.25. So why is that? Because the Doppler shift introduces a very small change in the temperature, but the main factor is the radius, which is 1.5 times, leading to L scaling as (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, but the problem statement says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is stationary (v=0), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But which direction? The problem doesn't specify, but the observed λ_max is same for both.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the observed wavelengths relate to their rest frames.

So, in the case where Star_2 is moving towards us:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v2_r / c )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 - v2_r / c )

Thus,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - 0.0002333 )

Which means λ2_rest is larger than λ1_rest. Because (1 - 0.0002333 ) is 0.9997667. So λ2_rest = λ1_rest / 0.9997667 ≈ λ1_rest * 1.0002333.

Which implies that T2 = b / λ2_rest ≈ b/(1.0002333 λ1_rest ) ≈ (b/λ1_rest ) * 0.9997667.

But T1 = b/λ1_rest.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 0.9997667.

So the ratio T1/T2 is 1/0.9997667 ≈ 1.0002333.

So, back to L ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1.0002333)^4 ≈ 2.25 * (1.000933) ≈ 2.252.

Which is approximately 2.25, as before.

So either way, the Doppler shift leads to a very small change in the temperature ratio, which when raised to the fourth power, gives a small change in L.

So, the main factor is the (1.5)^2 = 2.25, but the Doppler effect introduces a minor correction.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is A) ~2.25.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the Doppler shift affects the temperature. Let me think again. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption, so perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift when determining the temperature. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be shorter. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, so perhaps the calculation of T would take into account this shift.

Wait, perhaps I should model it from the perspective of the observer.

The observer measures the same λ_max for both stars. But what's the actual temperature of each star?

For Star_1, since it's not moving, λ1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which is moving, the observed λ2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v2/c ), if moving towards, or (1 + v2/c ) if moving away.

But the problem says that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, for Star_2 moving towards:

λ1 = λ2_rest * (1 - v2/c )

But,

λ1 = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2,

So,

b/T1 = (b / T2) (1 - v2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 - v2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c )

Similarly, for Star_2 moving away,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

But in either case, the difference is small because v2 is much smaller than c.

But let's plug in the numbers.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = approx 0.0023333.

So, for Star_2 moving towards us,

T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.0023333) ≈ T2 * (1.00234).

So,

T1 ≈ 1.00234 T2.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 1.00234,

so,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4.

Let me compute that.

(1.00234)^2 = approx 1.00468.

Then, (1.00468)^2 ≈ 1.0094.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0094.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1.0094) = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271.

Which is approximately 2.27, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's compute (1.00234)^4.

Using the binomial expansion.

(1 + x)^4 = 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4.

x = 0.00234.

So,

4x = 0.00936.

6x² = 6 * (0.00234)^2 = 6 * 0.0000054756 ≈ 0.00003285.

4x^3 = 4 * (0.00234)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.00001259 ≈ 0.00005036.

x^4 = (0.00234)^4 ≈ 0.000000029.

Adding up:

1 + 0.00936 = 1.00936

+ 0.00003285 → 1.00939285

+ 0.00005036 → 1.00944321

+ 0.000000029 → 1.00944324.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009443.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009443 ≈ 2.2709.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.27, which isn't one of the options. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, then:

T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.0023333 ) ≈ T2 * 0.99766.

So,

T1 ≈ 0.99766 T2.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 0.99766.

(0.99766)^4.

Again, using the expansion:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4,

where x=0.00234.

So,

1 -4x = 1 - 0.00936 = 0.99064.

+6x² = 0.99064 + 6*(0.00234)^2 → 6 * 0.0000054756 = 0.00003285 → 0.99067285.

-4x^3 = 0.99067285 -4*(0.00234)^3 → 4*(0.00001259) = 0.00005036 → 0.99062249.

+x^4 = 0.99062249 + 0.000000029 → ~0.99062252.

So,

(0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.9906225.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906225 ≈ 2.228.

Which is about 2.23, which is option D.

So, depending on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away, the ratio is either ~2.27 or ~2.23.

The problem states that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. So perhaps the radial velocity is positive, meaning moving away.

Wait, but in astronomy, the radial velocity is often given as positive when moving away (recession velocity), and negative when moving towards (approach). So the problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. So perhaps it's moving away, so v_r is +700 km/s.

So, using the earlier calculation, L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought that the Doppler effect is minor, but perhaps it's not negligible when considering the answer options.

Wait, but the possible answers are D) ~2.23 and A) ~2.25.

Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.00234)^4 and (0.99766)^4 more accurately.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the exact formula.

Let me redo this.

v2_r = 700 km/s.

v2_r / c = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 700e3 / 3e8 = (7e5) / (3e8) )= 7/(300) = 0.0023333...

So,

For Star_2 moving towards us (v_r = -700 km/s):

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c ) = λ2_rest * (1 - 0.0023333 ) = λ2_rest * 0.9976667.

And λ1_rest (since v1=0) is same as λ1_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_obs → λ2_rest = λ1_rest / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.00234 λ1_rest.

So,

λ2_rest ≈ 1.00234 λ1_rest.

But from Wien's law,

λ = b / T → T = b / λ.

Thus,

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b / (1.00234 λ1_rest ) = (b / λ1_rest ) * (1 / 1.00234 ) ≈ T1 * (0.99767).

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

Thus,

T1 = T2 * 1.00234.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1.00234.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4.

Which I previously calculated as approximately 1.009443.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.009443 = 2.25 * 1.009443 ≈ 2.2709, which is ~2.27.

But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Calculating (1.00234)^4:

1.00234^2 = 1.00234 * 1.00234.

Calculating:

1.00234 * 1.00234:

= (1 + 0.00234)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2

= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756

≈ 1.0046854756.

Now, square that to get (1.00234)^4:

(1.0046854756)^2.

= (1 + 0.0046854756)^2.

= 1^2 + 2 *1 *0.0046854756 + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + (approx 0.00002195).

≈ 1.0093929.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009393.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009393 ≈ 2.2709.

Hmm, but options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is the other way, considering the star is moving away. Let me compute that.

If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer.

So,

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.0023333) = 1.0023333 λ2_rest.

And since λ1_rest = λ2_obs,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.997667 λ1_rest.

Thus,

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b/(0.997667 λ1_rest ) = (b/λ1_rest) * 1.00234 → T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

So,

T2 = 1.00234 T1 → T1 = T2 / 1.00234 → T1 ≈ 0.99767 T2.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 0.99767.

So,

(0.99767)^4.

Calculating:

0.99767^2 = approx (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534 + 0.0000054 → 0.995345.

Then, square that: 0.995345^2 = (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 ≈ 0.99069 + 0.0000216 → 0.9907116.

So,

(0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907116.

Hence,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907116 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907116 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, why are there two possibilities depending on the direction of the velocity?

Because the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but doesn't specify the direction. So perhaps it's moving away, leading to a lower T1 and L ratio of ~2.23.

But why would the problem give a different answer when the direction of the velocity isn't specified? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the assumption is that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature because the stars' rest frames are what's important for calculating luminosity. But the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their rest frame temperatures are what's used in the L formula. So, the observed λ_max is the same, but the stars' rest frame λ_max are different because of their velocities.

But how does that affect the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

The problem states that the luminosity ratio is computed assuming the stars are black bodies. So, regardless of their velocities, the luminosity is based on their rest frame parameters.

But the observed λ_max is same for both. So, the observed λ_max is used to find their respective rest frame temperatures.

Wait, maybe the approach is:

- The observed wavelengths are same, λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ_obs.

- For Star_1: λ_obs = λ1_rest.

- For Star_2: λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r/c ).

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r/c ).

Then,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2_r/c ).

But from Wien's law,

λ_rest = b / T → T = b / λ_rest.

Thus,

T1 = b/λ1_rest,

T2 = b/λ2_rest = b/(λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c )) ) = (b/λ1_rest ) * (1 + v2/c ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So,

T2 = T1*(1 + 0.0023333 ) ≈ 1.002333 T1.

Thus,

T2/T1 ≈1.002333.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/1.002333 ≈0.99767.

Then,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99767)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, option D.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times greater. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - The peak wavelength of black body radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) for both stars is the same, the rest-frame temperatures of the stars must differ due to the Doppler effect.

2. **Doppler Effect**:
   - For Star_2, the observed wavelength is related to its rest-frame wavelength by:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
     \]
     where \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) is Star_2's radial velocity, and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(v_r/c \approx 0.002333\), the observed wavelength for Star_2 is slightly longer than its rest-frame wavelength if it is moving away.

3. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - From the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) equality, the rest-frame temperatures of the stars are related by:  
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + v_r/c}
     \]
     Substituting \(v_r/c \approx 0.002333\), we find:  
     \[
     T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot 0.99767
     \]
     Thus, the temperature ratio is:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767
     \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is proportional to \(R^2 T^4\). Using \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and the temperature ratio above:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     Substituting \((R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\) and \((T_1/T_2)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907\):  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to option **D**.
