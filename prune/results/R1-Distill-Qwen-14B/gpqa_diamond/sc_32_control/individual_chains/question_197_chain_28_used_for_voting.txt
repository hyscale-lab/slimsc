Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given.

First, the IR and NMR data are provided for Compound X. Let me look at the IR data. The strong absorbance around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an alcohol, amine, or maybe an alkyne. But wait, the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, 1450, and 1450 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), that's a broad singlet. That's probably an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they're split into a doublet. But this is a broad singlet, so maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton, but that's less likely.

Next, at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), that's typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. Like, for example, a para-substituted benzene. The downfield protons (8.0 ppm) would be the ones ortho to the substituent. Wait, let me think. If the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the protons on the ring would be deshielded. So if there's a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), that's EWG, which would cause the ring protons to be downfield.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That might be a CH near an electronegative group, perhaps a methine adjacent to an ester or ketone. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggest a CH2CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's an ester or ketone, along with an ethyl group. Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be a carbonyl oxygen next to a CH group. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the substituents. The aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. If the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton, then maybe the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the NMR would show a broad peak, which fits. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but that's less likely because of the broadness.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (around 1720-1740) or a ketone (maybe lower). If it's an ester, then the structure could have an ester group attached to the benzene ring. Let me see, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which is a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached as an ester. For example, something like OCOCH2CH2CH3? But wait, the substituent on the benzene would be the ester group.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) and a quartet maybe? Or is it a triplet because it's attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2? Hmm, the 0.9 is a triplet, so it's probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. But the NMR shows 1.7 ppm as a multiplet for 2H. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring.

Let me try drawing this. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. So perhaps it's a butyl group as a substituent, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoate ester, like OCOCH2CH2CH3, but then the ester would have an oxygen, and the substituent on the benzene would be the ester.

Wait, but the NMR data has a peak at 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the substituent has a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, looking at the substituent: the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a CH next to an oxygen, like in an ester or a ketone. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that CH. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached as an ester. Let me think: if the substituent is OCOCH2CH2CH3, then the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the CH3), a quartet at 1.3 ppm from the middle CH2, and a triplet at 2.5 ppm (for the CH2 next to the carbonyl). But in our NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, which doesn't fit that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone group, like (CH2)2CH(CH3) attached to the ring via a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone or an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are aromatic C=C. So maybe the compound is a benzophenone derivative. Or perhaps it's a substituted acetophenone.

Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm peak is a carbonyl oxygen attached to a CH, which would be a ketone. Wait, no, the 10.5 is a proton. Oh, right, I may have gotten that wrong. So the proton at 10.5 ppm is likely an acidic proton, such as an aldehyde (but aldehydes are usually less broad) or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids can have a broad peak around there.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group. So the substituent on the benzene would be a COOH group. Then the other parts would be the substituents on the benzene ring. But wait, the benzene ring in the NMR shows two doublets: 8.0 and 7.2, which are typical of a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Wait, no, actually, if it's para-substituted with a single substituent, the protons would be a doublet each. Wait, but if there are two substituents in the para positions, that's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substituent?

Alternatively, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester, so the substituent is an ester group. Let me think: if the substituent is an ester like OCO-R, where R is some alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, possibly from an aldehyde, but that's not fitting with the IR showing a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl ester? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a phenyl ester. For example, something like benzene with a substituent that is an ester group, like OCOCH2CH2CH3. Then the ester would have a methyl group and a propyl chain.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would be the end of a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps the CH next to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via a ketone to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group attached as a ketone, like (benzene)-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the ring via a carbonyl, but that would be a ketone. So the structure would be like:

Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2

Wait, but that would require more protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzoyl group attached to a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group, Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Then, in the NMR, the ester would have the CH2CH2CH3 group. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which would be the CH3 of the propyl group. Then, the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at around 1.4 ppm? But wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which doesn't fit a quartet.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let me try to sketch this:

The benzene ring has a substituent at the para position, which is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2 and a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, let's reconstruct the possible structure. The NMR indicates a triplet at 0.9 (3H) → likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 (d, 3H) → CH(CH3). The 1.7 (m, 2H) → perhaps the CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 (m, 1H) → perhaps the CH connected to the carbonyl.

So perhaps the substituent is Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that seems a bit long. Alternatively, maybe it's Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3) something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached as a ketone. Like Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Then, the NMR would show the CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. The triplet at 0.9 would be the end CH3, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.3 ppm, but in the data, it's 1.7 (m, 2H), which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl. Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Then the CH2CH2CH3 would have triplet at 0.9, a quartet at 1.3, and a triplet at 2.6 (next to carbonyl). But in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, which doesn't fit the quartet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group attached via a carbonyl. So Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then the CH2CH2CH3 would have the triplet at 0.9, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.3. But in the NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet (d, 3H) which is 3H, which would be a CH3 group attached to a CH. So that would fit if it's CH(CH3). So perhaps the substituent is Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3). But then, where does the 1.7 (m, 2H) come from? Maybe it's the two CH2 groups from CH2-CH(CH3).

Wait, let's try to piece it together. The substituent is a propyl group attached via a ketone. Let me think: the benzene ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl group, and the carbonyl is connected to a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the structure would be Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that seems like a longer chain, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via a carbonyl. So the structure would be Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3). Then the NMR would show:

- The CH3 (from CH(CH3)) would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm if it's attached to a CH2, but here it's attached to a CH. So it would be a doublet? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group connected to a CH2, which is connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then the CH2CH2CH3 would give a triplet at 0.9, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.3. But in the NMR, 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which could be a CH3 attached to a CH.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the carbonyl is connected to a CH that is connected to a CH2CH2CH3. Then the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have the CH2CH2CH3 as a propyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 as a doublet (3H), which would fit a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group attached via a carbonyl. So the substituent is Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH(CH3). Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH3 at 0.9 (triplet) → from the CH(CH3) group.
- The CH2 next to CH(CH3) would be a quartet at 1.3, but in the data, 1.7 is a multiplet, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have:

- The CH2CH2CH3 would have triplet at 0.9.
- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at ~1.3.
- The CH (attached to the carbonyl) would be a triplet around 2.5 ppm.

But in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), so that's a possibility. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups from the CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have:

- The CH2CH2CH3 group: triplet at 0.9 (3H), quartet at 1.3 (2H), and triplet at 2.5 (1H attached to CH).
- The CH (from CO-CH-) would be a triplet around 2.5. But the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (1H, m), which could be that.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this is a reaction that converts alcohols to alkenes via the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but wait, no, that's for ketones. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but red phosphorus and HI is used for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's the reduction of esters or ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction.

Wait, wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but that's adding HI across a double bond. Alternatively, in the presence of an alcohol, they might form an alkyl halide via substitution if it's an SN2 mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is undergoing a substitution reaction where -OH is replaced by -I. But the initial structure would have an alcohol group.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 3400-2500 cm-1, which could be an alcohol or amine. The 1720 is a carbonyl. So if the substituent is a carbonyl group and an alcohol, then perhaps it's an ester, because esters have both an alcohol (in the ester group) and a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, if it's an ester, like Ar-O-CO-R, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1720), and the O-H stretch (broad, which may not be present if it's an ester, unless it's a free -OH). Alternatively, maybe the compound is a methyl ester or ethyl ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative. But the NMR at 10.5 is a broad peak, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is a carboxylic acid, then the structure would be Ar-COOH. The NMR would show a broad peak for the -OH proton around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm. The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1, which is what the data shows (1720). So that fits.

But then, what about the other NMR signals? The aromatic peaks suggest a para-substituted benzene. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets would be the protons ortho and para to the substituent. Wait, no, if it's a mono-substituted benzene with a substituent in the para position, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has another substituent in the meta or ortho position.

Wait, no, the NMR shows two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests that there are two equivalent protons on each of two sets of carbons. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, but that would require a di-substituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position and has a branching that leads to equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to the benzene ring. No, but the NMR shows a CH3 at 0.9, so that's an ethyl group somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionoyl group (like Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH3). Then, the NMR would show the CH2CH2CH3 group. Let me think about that.

So, the substituent is a propionoyl group. Then, the NMR would have:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → CH2CH2CH3.
- 1.4 ppm (m, 2H) → the middle CH2 group.
- 2.5 ppm (t, 2H) → the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

But in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which could fit the middle CH2. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) doesn't fit the propionoyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group attached to a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(propionyl)benzoic acid. But that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product of the reaction. The reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

I need to figure out what the structure of X is, then determine what happens in this reaction.

If X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and an alcoholic group, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but if X has an alcohol group, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction if X has a beta-hydroxy group.

Wait, another thought: if X has a carbonyl group adjacent to an alcohol group, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X is an ester, then reacting with HI might lead to its cleavage. For example, esters can be cleaved with HI to form alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction is a reduction. Wait, Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes, but red phosphorus and HI is another possibility. I'm not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where an -OH group is replaced by -I. So if X has an alcohol group, then it would form an alkyl iodide.

But the IR data shows a peak at 3300-2500, which is typical of an -OH stretch. So if X is an alcohol, then the reaction with HI could form an alkyl iodide via acid-catalyzed SN1 or SN2 mechanism.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1) suggests that it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.

If X is an ester, then perhaps the reaction with HI would cleave it into a carboxylic acid and an alkyl iodide.

Wait, but if X is a benzene ring with a substituent that is an ester, like Ar-O-CO-R, then the reaction with HI might hydrolyze the ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, but that's under acidic conditions. Alternatively, under basic conditions, esters saponify, but with HI, it's more likely to be acid-catalyzed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester, which could undergo elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzylic alcohol, which under acidic conditions (like HI) would undergo substitution to form a benzyl iodide.

Wait, but the IR of X has a peak at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So if X is a benzaldehyde, the IR would have a strong peak around 1700, which fits. The NMR for a benzaldehyde would show the aldehyde proton around 9.8-10 ppm as a singlet. That matches the 10.5 ppm peak as a broad singlet. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but they can be broad if in a certain environment.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. Let me think: the aldehyde proton would typically be a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. So that's possible. Then, the rest of the NMR would need to fit.

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then the substituent on the benzene would be an aldehyde group. But then, the other NMR signals would be from the substituents attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, but the NMR shows an aromatic ring with two substituents, as indicated by the two doublets. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents: an aldehyde group and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanal group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the options given.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position (relative to the propanoic acid group). So the substituents are -COOH and -CH2CH2CH3 in the para positions? No, wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the phenyl group attached to the alpha carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, no, the correct structure would have the benzene attached to the second carbon of a propanoic acid. So the benzene is attached to CH2COOH. So the substituent is a CH2COOH group on the benzene ring, and another substituent is an ethyl group in the para position.

But the NMR data doesn't show a -COOH group except for the 10.5 ppm. Hmm.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

That's para-xylene with an isobutyl group. Benzene with -CH(CH2CH3)2 and a methyl group in para positions. But the NMR doesn't fit this because the substituents would cause different splitting.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

This would have a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position, which is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)2.

So the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H, because the substituents are in the para positions. So that fits the NMR data.

For the substituent:

The sec-butyl group: the CH(CH2CH3)2 would have a CH that's attached to two CH2CH3 groups. The CH would show up as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H), which matches the NMR.

The two CH2 groups (from the two isopropyl groups) would have protons around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) for each CH3 group.

Additionally, the terminal CH3 from the ethyl group would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), but wait, a sec-butyl group is actually CH(CH2CH3)2, which doesn't have a terminal CH3. Wait, no: the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-

But wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct: the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH3 groups from the CH2CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) each, but since there are two, perhaps as a quartet or something else.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a single CH3 group attached to a CH. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group, not CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached via a CH2.

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be:

benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3)2 group: the CH would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet around 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 6H?), but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm as 3H. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3) group. So the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but then the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3) would be around 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The next CH2 would be around 1.4 ppm (2H), but the NMR shows 1.4 as 3H, which is a CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)-CH2CH2CH3 group. Then, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have the triplet at 0.9, quartet at 1.3, and triplet at 2.5. But the data shows 1.7 as a multiplet (2H), which could fit the CH2 adjacent to CH(CH3).

Putting it all together, the substituent would be a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group, making a propyl group with a branch. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group or something else. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should compare to the options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzoic acid (COOH) at position 4, and a sec-butyl group (CH(CH2CH3)CH2-) at position 4? No, wait, the substituents are in the para positions, so if COOH is at position 1, the sec-butyl would be at position 4.

So the structure would be:

COOH attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Then, the substituent (sec-butyl) is -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

So the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H) → matches.
- The CH(CH3)2 group: the CH would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The CH3 groups from the CH(CH3)2 would be as doublets around 1.4 ppm (each 3H). But in the data, 1.4 is a doublet (3H), so perhaps only one CH3 is present, which doesn't fit the sec-butyl group, which has two CH3 groups attached to the same CH.

Wait, that's a problem. The NMR shows 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H), which suggests a single CH3 group attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is not a sec-butyl group but a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a single CH3 attached. So the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The next CH2 would be at 1.4 ppm (2H), but the data shows 1.4 as a doublet (3H), which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the reaction.

The reaction is Compound X treated with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do? I think this is a reaction where X is an alcohol, and it's undergoing substitution to form an iodide. Alternatively, if X is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone), the reaction could be a reduction to form an alkane.

Wait, I recall that red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, the Arndt-Eistert reaction uses these reagents to form enol ethers, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the -OH is replaced by -I.

Wait, another possibility: if X is an ester, the reaction with HI could cleave the ester to form a carboxylic acid and an alkyl iodide.

So, if X is an ester (like R-O-CO-R'), then treatment with HI would hydrolyze the ester to R'OH and R-OH. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the ester is converted to an acid.

Wait, but the product options include compounds with acid groups, so perhaps the reaction is cleaving an ester to form a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction reduces it to a benzyl alcohol. But then the product would have an -OH group, which isn't present in the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then upon reduction with something, it would form the corresponding alcohol. But the reaction here is with red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to an alkane.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to an alkane, forming 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a secondary alcohol, and the reaction converts it to an iodide. For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl ethanol, then treatment with HI would form 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl iodide.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The IR of X has peaks at 3400-2500 (likely -OH), 1720 (carbonyl), 1610, 1450 (aromatic C=C). The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which could be an -OH or an aldehyde.

If the substituent is a carbonyl group and an -OH group, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an ester group. Wait, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl propionate ester. For example, the structure would be Ph-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Then, the reaction with HI could hydrolyze the ester to form Ph-COOH (benzoic acid) and the corresponding alcohol.

But in the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would suggest that the ester was on the benzene ring at the para position to the benzoic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options and the NMR.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

The structure would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. The NMR would show aromatic protons, and the substituents would include a propionoic acid group.

The propanoic acid group would have a CH2 adjacent to the COOH. But the NMR of X doesn't show signals that would correspond to that, perhaps.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure is COOH at para position to the sec-butyl group on the benzene.

The NMR of X would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (2H each), which matches.
- The sec-butyl group would have a CH at 2.9 ppm (1H), adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H), and the two CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (each 3H as a doublet). But the NMR shows 1.4 as a single doublet (3H), which doesn't fit two CH3 groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group, but that doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So the structure is Ar-CO-CH2CH2CH(CH3). Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The next CH2 at 1.4 ppm (2H), but the data shows 1.4 as a doublet (3H), which again doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH3 group, but that doesn't include a CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. One possible reaction is the elimination of HX (in this case, HI) from an alcohol to form an alkene. But for that, X would need to have a beta-hydroxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where an -OH is replaced by -I.

But since the NMR of X shows an -OH (broad peak at 10.5), that suggests X has an -OH group. So if X has an -OH and a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an alcohol.

Wait, but if X is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl group, the reaction with HI could form an alkene via elimination.

For example, if X is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group (like a dihydroxy ketone), then HI could protonate the -OH, leading to elimination of water and formation of an alkene.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction cleaves it.

Wait, another approach: the IR of X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm in NMR is a broad peak, which could be an -OH. So X could be an acid, like a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So if X is an ester of benzoic acid, reaction with HI would hydrolyze it to form the acid.

If X is the ester, then the product would be the acid. So option C is a benzoic acid derivative, which would be the product if X is the ester.

But wait, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a reaction that converts esters into alkenes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to cleave the ester.

Wait, another reaction: the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction uses Al alcohol to reduce ketones, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the ester group is converted into an alkyl iodide. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid anhydride, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an ester group.

Wait, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, like Ph-O-CO-R, and the reaction cleaves it to form Ph-COOH and R-O-I.

But in that case, the product would be benzoic acid, which is option C if R is a sec-butyl group.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR of X shows:

- 10.5 ppm: broad singlet, likely -OH (from acid) or aldehyde.
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: aromatic, para substituents.
- 2.9 ppm: m, 1H → perhaps a CH adjacent to carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm: m, 2H → CH2.
- 1.4 ppm: d, 3H → CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm: t, 3H → CH2CH2CH3.

This suggests that the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group attached via a carbonyl to the benzene ring.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. So the substituent would be CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Then, the structure would be Ar-CO-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3.

But that's a long chain and may not match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, making the structure Ar-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H), and the CH3 groups from CH(CH3)2 at 1.4 ppm (each 3H as a doublet). But the NMR shows 1.4 as a single doublet (3H), which doesn't fit two CH3 groups.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the carbonyl.

So the structure is Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3).

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (3H, d).
- The terminal CH3 from the ethyl group at 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

Wait, but where does the ethyl group come from? Because in this structure, the substituent is Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3), which doesn't include an ethyl group. So the CH3 at 0.9 ppm would have to come from somewhere else. Maybe there's another substituent on the benzene ring, like an ethyl group in the para position.

So the benzene ring would have two substituents: a CO-CH2-CH(CH3) group and an ethyl group in the para position.

Then, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H → fits.
- The CO-CH2-CH(CH3) group: CH2 at 2.9 ppm (1H?), no, wait, the CH2 would be split into a triplet perhaps. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would show the CH2CH2CH3 group as triplet at 0.9 ppm, quartet at 1.3 ppm, and triplet at 2.5 ppm. But the data has 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), which would correspond to the CH group attached to the CO.

So the structure would be Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Then, the substituent would have:

- CH2CH2CH3: triplet at 0.9, quartet at 1.3, triplet at 2.5.
- CH attached to CO: quartet at 2.9 ppm (1H) due to coupling with adjacent CH2.

But in the data, 2.9 is a multiplet (1H), which could fit. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 next to the CH, and the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be from where? Hmm, maybe another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ar-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3. No, that doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction again. If X has an ester group (R-O-CO-R'), then reaction with HI would hydrolyze the ester to R'OH and R-OH. But if X is a methyl ester, for example, then the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid derivative. So if X is the ester, the product would be option C.

But how does the reaction with HI and red phosphorus fit into this? I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the ester oxygen is replaced by iodide.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a benzoyl chloride, but then the IR would show a different carbonyl peak. Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but again, the IR would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on an ester by HI, leading to the formation of an alkyl iodide and the acid.

For example, ester R-O-CO-R' would react with HI to form R'-I and R-O-CO-H (the acid).

That would fit if X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

So, if X is the ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

Looking at the options: option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the reaction is X (ester) → upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus → benzoic acid.

Thus, the product would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the final product of the reaction, we analyze the given IR and NMR data for Compound X and consider the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI).

### Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group (alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

From the NMR data, the structure of Compound X is deduced to be **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure includes:
- A para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a sec-butyl (-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂) group.
- The sec-butyl group explains the NMR signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), and 1.4 ppm (CH₃). The terminal CH₃ of the ethyl group accounts for the signal at 0.9 ppm.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are used to hydrolyze esters or aldehydes, forming carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter the functional group. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the NMR data and is consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
