Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's a statistical mixture of pure states.

Wait, so what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? A qubit is a two-level system, so its density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], but I think there's a more specific form when it's a pure state versus a mixed state.

Wait, the given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me expand that. |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which would be a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the (1,1) position. So adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. But then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. That makes sense. This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities on the diagonal.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation where each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state.

Wait, but wait. The Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? Because a pure state is a unit vector on the sphere. But density matrices describe mixed states as well. So how do density matrices fit into the Bloch sphere picture?

Oh right, any density matrix can be represented as a point in the 3D space, where the Bloch vector (r) is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The Bloch vector r has components (r_x, r_y, r_z), and the density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

So given ρ, I can find r by rearranging that equation. Let's compute each component.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

Alternatively, expanding that, as I did before, ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. Let me compute the components of r.

The formula is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

So let's write out each term.

First, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Then, the σ matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each of these multiplied by r_x, r_y, r_z respectively and then added.

So putting it all together.

ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz) / 2.

Let me compute each term:

I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

r_x σx /2 = r_x/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]]

r_y σy /2 = (r_y/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] → [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]]

r_z σz /2 = (r_z/2) * [[1,0], [0, -1]] → [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]]

Adding all these together:

The (0,0) element is 1/2 + 0 + 0 + r_z/2 = (1 + r_z)/2.

The (0,1) element is 0 + r_x/2 - i r_y/2.

The (1,0) element is 0 + r_x/2 + i r_y/2.

The (1,1) element is 1/2 + 0 + 0 - r_z/2 = (1 - r_z)/2.

But the given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So let's set up equations for each component:

1. (0,0): (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → Multiply both sides by 2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

2. (1,1): (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z=0. Consistent with above.

3. (0,1): r_x/2 - i r_y/2 = 0. So both real and imaginary parts must be zero.

So, real part: r_x/2 = 0 → r_x=0.

Imaginary part: (-r_y)/2 = 0 → r_y=0.

So all components of r are zero. So r=(0,0,0).

Wait, but what does that mean? The origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch vector's length is the purity parameter. For a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero, meaning r=0. Because in that case, the state is maximally mixed, which is the case when the density matrix is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, let me double-check. The maximally mixed state for a qubit is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Yes, which is exactly the given ρ. So that's the completely mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere, represented by the origin.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the correct answer.

So the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. So the answer is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we see that all off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal. This implies:

1. \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \), as the off-diagonal terms vanish and the diagonal terms are symmetric.
2. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.**  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state along the \( z \)-axis, not a mixed state.**  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this represents the origin of the Bloch sphere for a maximally mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.**

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
