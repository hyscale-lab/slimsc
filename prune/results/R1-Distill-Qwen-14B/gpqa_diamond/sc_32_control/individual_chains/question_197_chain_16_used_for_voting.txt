Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me start by looking at the data provided: the IR and NMR spectra.

First, let's analyze the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or maybe N-H stretches. But another strong peak is at 1720 cm-1, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which is present here. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group in Compound X.

Looking at the NMR data next. Let me jot down the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – That's a broad singlet, which often suggests an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid group.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – These look like aromatic protons. The doublets with 2H each suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So, like in a para-substituted benzene, maybe like p-methyl or something.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – Maybe a CH adjacent to something electronegative or in a CH2 group. Hmm.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – Possibly a CH2 group next to another CH, perhaps in a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – A triplet of 3H as a doublet. That's probably a CH(CH3) group, like an isobutyl or something. Wait, a doublet suggests two neighboring groups. Oh, maybe a CH2CH(CH3) structure, so like a sec-butyl group?

And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – That's a terminal CH3, like from an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl chain attached somewhere.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let's see: if the benzene is para-substituted, that would explain the two doublets. Suppose one substituent is a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, so maybe it's a single proton, like a phenolic O-H? No, wait, that's a carboxylic acid's O-H. So, a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, what about the other signals. The 2.9 ppm m for 1H might be adjacent to the ring. Let's think, maybe a CH2 group next to the ring. Wait, the 1.7 ppm is m for 2H, perhaps part of a chain. Let's say the structure is something like benzene with a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to another CH which is attached to a CH3. So maybe a propyl chain? Or perhaps an isobutyl group.

Wait, if I have a benzene ring with a COOH group at the para position and another substituent, maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me think about the splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is more like a benzene ring with a side chain that has a carbonyl group. Wait, but wait, the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then that would fit. But wait, the IR also has a 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1, which might be C=C stretching, typical for aromatic rings.

So, putting it all together. The structure probably has a benzene ring with a para-substituted group, which is a chain leading to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal CH3. So perhaps the chain is something like CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which would be a CH(CH3) group. So maybe the structure is: benzene ring with a substituent that is a CH2CH(CH3)COOH.

Wait, no, that might not fit. Let me think again.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm: O-H of COOH.
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: para-substituted benzene.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): Maybe a CH between the benzene and the COOH, or maybe part of a CH2 group.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): Two adjacent CH2 groups.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): A CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): A terminal CH3.

So perhaps the structure is benzene with a COOH group and a side chain that is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- or something similar.

Wait, maybe it's more like:

Benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-COOH. But then the NMR would show more signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but let's think about the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me draw that out.

If the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's a secondary butyl group. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent that's (CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but looking at the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be the CH in the middle of the chain. Then, 1.7 is m for 2H, which could be the CH2 next to the benzene. Then the 1.4 is a doublet of 3H, which would be the CH(CH3) group. So for example, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, wait, then where is the COOH?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a COOH at the end. Let me think.

Another approach: perhaps the compound is a substituted benzoic acid. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl (like COOH at around 1700 cm-1). The O-H in COOH is around 10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 peak.

So if the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent on the benzene ring, perhaps in the para position.

So, for example, the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Now, what's the 'something' substituent?

Looking at the NMR:

The 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) suggest the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH group, so that the ring is para-substituted.

The other signals are from the substituent. The substituent is probably an ethyl group or a longer chain.

Wait, but the substituent's protons are the 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, that seems like a chain of four carbons: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But that's a pentyl group, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let me think: a substituent that is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position.

Wait, but the substituent would be -O-CH2... No, probably a direct substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but the NMR has 2.9 (m,1H). So maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a neopentyl group, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group. Let me think step by step.

The substituent is a group that has a CH in the middle, so maybe -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent's NMR signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

So putting that together, perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? No, that would be a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the substituent.

Wait, another approach: let's determine the structure step by step.

The substituent has a CH group (the 2.9 ppm, 1H), which is connected to two CH2 groups (the 1.7 ppm, 2H). Then, there's a CH3 attached to the CH group (1.4 ppm, d), and another CH3 at the end (0.9 ppm, t).

So the substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's butyl. Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that leaves the CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain, but with a branch. Maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, making it a pentyl group? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the substituent has a CH2 group attached to benzene, then another CH connected to a CH3 and a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure.

The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4, and another substituent at position 1 (assuming the COOH is at position 4).

The substituent is a chain attached to the ring. The chain has a CH2 group next to the ring, then a CH group, which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH3. No, wait, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe it's:

Benzene ring with a COOH group (para) and a substituent that's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but how does that fit the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH(CH2CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 attached to the benzene. The 1.4 ppm (3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH. Wait, but that would make the substituent a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But then where's the 0.9 ppm (3H) from?

Ah, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the chain is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But then the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet, because it's attached to a CH2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me see: the CH2 next to the ring (2H at ~1.7 ppm), then the CH (1H at ~2.9 ppm), then the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the CH2CH3's end CH3 is a triplet? Because it's attached to a CH2, which is attached to the CH. So the CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the CH, leading to a triplet for the terminal CH3. That would explain the 0.9 ppm triplet.

Then the CH(CH2CH3) would have the 1H at 2.9 ppm, which is split into a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent CH2 and maybe the CH2 from the ring.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the ring, which is adjacent to the CH and perhaps the ring's deshielded protons, leading to a multiplet.

So putting it all together, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is benzene with a COOH group and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para positions.

Wait, but wait. The COOH is at one para position, and the substituent is at the other, making it 4-(something)benzoic acid.

So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So the structure would be 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid. Wait, 2-methylpropyl is isobutyl, right?

Wait, 2-methylpropane is isobutane, but the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Wait, perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Let's think: an isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a tertiary butyl. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would be a secondary butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that's a neopentyl group, which is a tertiary butyl.

Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Let me check the substituent's carbon chain.

The substituent has a CH2 (2H), then a CH (1H), then a CH3 (1.4 ppm), and a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm). So the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the elimination of a carboxylic acid. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid-catalyzed elimination of CO2 from a carboxylic acid to form an alkyl iodide.

Wait, wait. No, actually, wait! When a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it typically undergoes the Baeyer-Villiger elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of an acyl iodide, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another reaction: carboxylic acids can react with HX (like HI) in the presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus. That's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, that's for ketones. Wait, wait, no. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Red phosphorus and HI are used for something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's the preparation of an acyl iodide. Carboxylic acids can react with PCl5 to form acyl chlorides. But with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's forming an acid chloride, which then could undergo some reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it may lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide via the elimination of CO2. Like, for example, if the acid is RCOOH, it could form R-I after losing CO2.

So, in this case, if Compound X is RCOOH, then the product would be RI. But looking at the options, some are acids, others are aromatic compounds.

Wait, the options include benzoic acid derivatives and substituted benzene rings.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid – a benzoic acid derivative.
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene – a substituted toluene.
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid – another benzoic acid.
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene – another toluene derivative.

So, if X is a benzoic acid, and the product after reaction with red P and HI is an alkyl iodide, then the product would be an alkyl benzene with an iodide. But the options don't have any iodides. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration reaction? No, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's for the preparation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the formation of an acyl iodide. So, RCOOH + P + HI → RCOI + other products. But acyl iodides are reactive and can undergo various reactions, like nucleophilic acyl substitution.

But the options don't include an acyl iodide; all are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. For example, if X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction leads to decarboxylation, forming a substituted benzene ring.

Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid is decarboxylated to form an alkyl iodide. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can form an iodide. The reaction proceeds via the formation of an acyl iodide as an intermediate, which then eliminates CO2 to form an alkyl iodide.

So, for example, RCOOH → R-I (after losing CO2). So, if X is RCOOH, the product would be R-I, but in the options, the products are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction isn't decarboxylation but something else. Maybe the substituent is an ester, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak. Oh, wait the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me re-examine the IR data. The 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which could be O-H from a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which would fit a carbonyl, so that supports a carboxylic acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching.

So, if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, then reacting with red P and HI would lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide. But the options don't have an iodide. Hence, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group. Because the IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which could also be an ester. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet around 4 ppm that would be expected for an ester's CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone. But the NMR data doesn't show a strong signal for a ketone's CH3, unless it's in a specific environment.

Wait, maybe I should look for another reaction. If X has a carbonyl group (like ester or ketone), reacting with HI could lead to an addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a Grignard reaction, but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but that doesn't fit with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to figure out the structure of X first.

So, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. The substituent is a chain that has the NMR signals I mentioned. Let's try to build it.

The substituent has a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d) attached to the CH, and a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t).

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, but that's four carbons: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But the NMR only shows two groups of CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, that would have:

- CH2 (1.7, m, 2H)
- CH (2.9, m, 1H)
- CH2CH3 (0.9, t, 3H)

But where's the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Oh, that would be the CH(CH3) group. Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. But that would be a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2 group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would be a neopentyl group, and the NMR would show different signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But then, in the NMR, the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet, but in the data, it's a multiplet. So that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: looking at the substituent's NMR signals.

The substituent's protons are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group connected to two CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two Hs on a CH2 connected to the benzene and another CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 connected to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3 connected to a CH2.

So, the substituent could be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that makes it a pentyl substituent. Let me see:

- CH2 attached to the ring: 1.7 ppm (2H) as a multiplet.

- CH attached to that CH2 and the next CH2: 2.9 ppm (1H) as a multiplet.

- The next CH2 would have two Hs, but they're not showing up in the data provided. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a CH3 branch.

So, substituent: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But that would have:

- CH2 (1.7, 2H)

- CH (2.9, 1H)

- CH2 (maybe 1.4 ppm, but no, that's a CH3).

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think:

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of a sec-butyl group is actually CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the terminology wrong.

Wait, butyl groups:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: -CH2CH(CH3)2

- sec-butyl: -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at para and a sec-butyl group.

So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Which is option C.

But let me check the NMR.

The sec-butyl group would have the structure:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in the substituent, there's a CH2 next to the ring (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH (2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 (but wait, I'm not seeing a triplet for that), and a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, and 0.9 ppm, t).

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

So, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In this case, the NMR would show:

- Benzene-CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H, m)

- CH (2.9 ppm, 1H, m)

- CH2CH3 at the end: the CH2 would be split into a triplet, but in the data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is the terminal CH3. But the CH2 next to that would be at, say, 1.3 ppm as a quartet, but that doesn't appear in the data. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then:

- CH attached to the benzene: that would have 2H from the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the reaction.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would lead to what?

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would likely undergo decarboxylation to form an alkyl iodide. So, the benzoic acid would lose CO2 and form an iodide.

So, the product would be benzene with a sec-butyl group and an iodide. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the benzoic acid is RCOOH. Upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus, it would form R-I, as CO2 is eliminated.

So, for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butyl benzene? No, wait, the mechanism is that the COOH is converted to I.

Wait, no, the structure would be benzene with a substituent that was RCOOH becomes R-I.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzene iodide. But looking at the options, none of them are iodides. So perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a decarboxylation but something else.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid. Let me reevaluate the IR data. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a ketone as well as a carboxylic acid.

If the 1720 is an ester, then the O-H peak in the IR (broad around 3400–2500) could be from an alcohol or maybe an acid. But if it's an ester, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, like in an ester's formation.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid O-H. So, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, and the reaction is decarboxylation.

But then, the product would be an alkyl iodide, which isn't in the options. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a benzoic acid. So, if X is option C, then what would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI give?

Wait, perhaps it's not a decarboxylation. Maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a good leaving group, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction is a hydrolysis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be forming a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Fries rearrangement, but that's for esters under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the carboxylic acid is converted into an iodide.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, if the product is an alkyl iodide, it's not in the options. So perhaps I should reevaluate whether X is a benzoic acid or not.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That fits the NMR and IR data.

So, if X is option C, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would produce a compound.

But what's the product of a benzoic acid reacting with red phosphorus and HI? I think it's the formation of an acyl iodide, but then the product would be RCOI, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, after forming the acyl iodide, maybe further reaction occurs.

Wait, another reaction: perhaps the acid is treated with HI to form an acid iodide, which can then undergo elimination to form an alkene. But in that case, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the product would already be a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look for another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol. But where's the alcohol in X?

Wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid O-H proton.

So, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of an iodide.

But the options don't have an iodide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a decarboxylation but something else.

Wait, perhaps red phosphorus and HI are used to form an acid chloride, but that's done with PCl5, not HI.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an iodide. So, converting RCOOH to RI.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then after substitution, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene iodide, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination. If X has a substituent that can form a double bond upon elimination, then the product would be an alkene.

Looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which isn't an alkene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted toluene.

Wait, if I decarboxylate 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, I would eliminate CO2 and form a bond between the ring and the adjacent carbon. So, for example, if the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH group and a CH2CH(CH3)2 group in para positions, then elimination would form a double bond between the ring and the substituent. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and elimination would form a double bond, but the options don't show that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones to form lactones. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester. But I don't see ester peaks in the IR.

Wait, another possibility: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. So, perhaps X is an ester, not a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid O-H. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to a substitution. But where's the O-H in the NMR? It would suggest an alcohol, but the data shows 10.5 ppm, which is a broad peak, more like a carboxylic acid.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the answer options. The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. So, perhaps the reaction isn't a decarboxylation but a substitution on the substituent.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid, and the substituent is a group that can undergo substitution with HI, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary or secondary alkyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction is a substitution to form an iodide, but again, I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the acid leaves, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring substitution. But that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's typically under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, but I don't see any obvious functional groups to reduce except the carbonyl.

Wait, but in this case, the X has a carbonyl (COOH), so maybe the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2OH group, but that would require different reagents.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me try to go back.

The NMR data indicates a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that includes a chain of CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps. Wait, but the options include 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid as option C.

If that's the case, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form an alkyl iodide, but that's not an option. So perhaps the reaction instead is a substitution where the COOH is converted to an iodide, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is option C, and the reaction is a substitution, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with an iodide in place of the COOH, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction forms an alkene via elimination. But again, the options don't show an alkene.

Hmm. Maybe I'm supposed to think that the reaction doesn't change the substituent. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, if X is a benzoic acid with an adjacent substituent that can undergo a Claisen or similar rearrangement.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm peak is an O-H. So, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is for decarboxylation to form an alkyl iodide.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butyl benzene, but that's not an option. So perhaps the reaction isn't decarboxylation.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the OH is replaced by I. But then, X would need to be an alcohol, which it isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so with these reagents.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation. But X has a double bond? The IR shows a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could be a C=C stretch, but the NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative, but the NMR doesn't show the expected signals for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but without the expected NMR signals, I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to make a decision based on the given data.

The IR and NMR data point towards X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which typically cause decarboxylation to form an alkyl iodide, the product would be 4-iodo-sec-butyl benzene. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the same as X. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but does something else.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the question states that X reacts with these reagents, so the product must be different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which is an electrophilic species. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl bromide via substitution, but again, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that X is not a benzoic acid but an ester. Let me think.

If X is an ester, the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm-1, which fits. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

But then, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product of an ester hydrolysis. But the question is about the product of X reacting with these reagents, so if X were an ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

But the question says that X has the given IR and NMR data, and the options are possible products. Wait, but the reaction conditions would change X into something else.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess.

Based on the NMR and IR data, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes decarboxylation to form an iodide. But since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe the reaction is not a decarboxylation but a substitution on the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, which upon reaction with HI, undergoes substitution. But that's unlikely.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, but the NMR shows more complexity.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to another CH2.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that X is option C, and the reaction produces an alkyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct product is the same as X, which is option C. But that doesn't make sense because the question states that X reacts to form a product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but converts the COOH into something else. For instance, perhaps the COOH is converted into a methyl group, but that would require a reduction, which I'm not sure these reagents do.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I don't see how.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that can't be the product since X is the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that's not logical.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but the reagents don't match. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the COOH is replaced by an iodide, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without a halogen, that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've invested, I'll proceed with the assumption that X is option C, and the reaction produces an alkyl iodide, which isn't listed, so perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is the same as X. But that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid but an ester. Let me reevaluate.

If X is an ester, the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm-1 (ester carbonyl), and the NMR would show a triplet for the oxygenated CH2 group. But in the NMR data, I don't see such a triplet. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but the NMR doesn't show the expected signals.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction forms a benzyl iodide. But that's not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so I'll make an educated guess and go with option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, as the product. But that can't be right because X is the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent remains the same, and the COOH is converted to a methyl group via a reduction, but that's not supported by the reagents.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the data, I believe X is option C, and the reaction forms an alkyl iodide, but since that's not an option, I might have to pick the best fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent, and the product is the same as X, but that's not logical.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reaction conditions, red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of an acid to form an acid iodide. So, if X is a benzoic acid, it would form benzoyl iodide, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct product isn't listed, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, making the product 4-iodotoluene, but that's not an option either.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to make a choice based on the data pointing towards option C as X, so perhaps the product is another form, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a bromide or iodide, but again, that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling to form a benzene ring with a longer chain, but I don't see how.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, as that's the structure of X, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about X's structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one fits the NMR and IR data. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which fits the data.

So, when X (option C) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the product would be an alkyl iodide, but that's not an option. So perhaps the reaction isn't a decarboxylation but something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's hydroxyl group (if any) is replaced by iodide. But I don't see any hydroxyl groups in X.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a phenol, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3400 cm-1 for that.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis of the IR and NMR data provided is as follows:

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl substituent (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) typically lead to the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, forming an alkyl iodide. For 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, this would result in the elimination of CO₂ and the formation of 4-iodo-sec-butylbenzene. However, none of the options provided correspond to an alkyl iodide.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Does not match the IR and NMR data for Compound X.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: A substituted toluene derivative, inconsistent with the carboxylic acid group in X.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the IR and NMR data for Compound X, but this is the starting material, not the product.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Another substituted toluene derivative, inconsistent with the carboxylic acid group in X.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data strongly support that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). However, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would typically produce an alkyl iodide, which is not listed among the options. Since none of the options correspond to the expected product of the reaction, the most logical conclusion is that the product is not listed, and Option C remains the structure of X.
