Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. In the presence of a nucleophile like CN-, which is a good nucleophile, the carbonyl group would attack.

Wait, but wait. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, typically it adds the cyanide to the carbonyl carbon. So, the product would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a carbonyl, and then the oxygen becomes an alcohol. So, the product would have an -OH group and an -CN group on the same carbon.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN would form a cyanohydrin. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but wait. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense.

Now, what's the role of reagent A here? Because I think the reaction of ketones with CN- usually requires some acid catalysis. Oh, right! The addition of the cyanide to the carbonyl typically occurs under acidic conditions. The mechanism probably involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which then allows the CN- to attack.

So which reagent A would provide H+ ions? H3O+ is a possibility, which is a strong acid. But sometimes, other strong acids like H2SO4 or HCl are used, but looking at the options, option A is H3O+ and option C is NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, in the first step, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So, perhaps in the presence of acid, the cyanide adds to the ketone. So, A could be H3O+ (option A or B), or perhaps a different acid.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, if you have NaCN and a weak acid, maybe it's used. Or perhaps in the presence of a sulfonic acid. But the options don't have that. So looking at the options, which A's are possible.

Wait, another possibility: when you add NaCN, the solution is basic because NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN), so it's basic. So to protonate the carbonyl, you'd need an acid to provide H+ to make the carbonyl more reactive.

So, if the reagent A is H3O+ (a strong acid), then that would protonate the ketone, allowing the CN- to attack. So in the first step, A should be an acid like H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option B is A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. So for the first reaction, A would be H3O+. So that suggests either option A or B.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B in H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The common methods are acidic or basic hydrolysis. But let's think about the conditions.

In acidic hydrolysis, nitriles are treated with H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4. The reaction typically goes through an intermediate imidamide, and then further hydrolysis to the acid. Alternatively, there's another pathway where the nitrile is first converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach: nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. But oxidation of nitriles usually requires strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Wait, in the presence of H2O and acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

So, the reagent B is likely an acid, such as HCl or another strong acid. Looking at the options, the choices for B are HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), or CH3COOH (option D).

Wait, the problem states that reagent B is in H2O. So, the reaction is done in aqueous solution. So, adding H2O and a catalyst. So, perhaps B is HCl (a strong acid) which would help in the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the nitrile is first converted to an amide, which then is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H2O and a strong acid would facilitate the hydrolysis.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl. So if reagent A is H3O+ for the first reaction, then A is either option A or B.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is A. If the first reaction uses H3O+ (from option A or B), then the second reaction, B must be HCl (since in option A and C, B is HCl), but in option B, B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the first reaction again. Are there other possibilities? What if reagent A is NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite)? Then, in that case, the role of NaHSO3 might be as a dehydrating agent or something else.

Wait, no, because in the first reaction, we're adding NaCN and another reagent. Sodium bisulfite is a source of HSO3- which is a weaker acid. But in the presence of NaCN, perhaps it's acting as an acid catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a nitrile addition without acid. Wait, without acid, would the cyanide attack the ketone? I'm not sure. I think the addition of NaCN to ketones is typically done in basic conditions, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, no, wait. Maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, ketones are generally attacked by nucleophiles under basic conditions because the carbonyl is deprotonated. But wait, that's for enolate formation. Alternatively, in the presence of a weak acid, the carbonyl can be protonated to make it more electrophilic, allowing the nucleophile to attack.

Wait, so maybe the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, which is option A or B.

So, for the first reaction, correct reagent is H3O+. So that would make A be H3O+.

Looking back at the options, the options where A is H3O+ are options A and B.

Now, for the second reaction, the reagent B is in H2O. So, to get the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, B must be an acid, like HCl. So, which option has B as HCl? Option A and C.

But in option C, A is NaHSO3. So if our first reaction requires H3O+, then option C is out.

So, looking at options A and B for first reaction, and then for second reaction, which has B as HCl.

Option A has B = HCl, which is good for the second reaction.

So, which option has A = H3O+ and B = HCl? That's option A.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, for the hydrolysis of nitriles, H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) is used as the acid. But in the options, the only HCl is in option A and C.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a weak acid like acetic acid. But I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions typically uses strong acids. So, HCl is more likely.

So, option A would have B as HCl, which is correct.

But wait, the initial product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, in the second step, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So, when that nitrile is hydrolyzed, the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, perhaps the structure is RCH(OH)CH2CN → RCH(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, no, the product given is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which has the hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the COOH group.

Wait, but that would mean that during hydrolysis, the nitrile becomes a COOH, and the hydroxyl is also on the same carbon. So, I'm thinking that the nitrile group (-CN) is on a carbon that already has an OH group, and during hydrolysis, that CN becomes COOH, so the OH is on the same carbon as the COOH.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. The starting compound is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on the fourth carbon. So, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN.

Wait, but in this case, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CN ?

Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. So let me think: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So, the structure is:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CN? Hmm no, wait. Wait, but the name is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

(CH2)2-C(OH)(Ph-C6H4-CH2)-CN ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure, but the key point is that the nitrile is in a position adjacent to the hydroxyl group. When it's hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid, so the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile becomes a COOH, and the OH stays. So the reaction is converting the nitrile to COOH, which requires acid hydrolysis.

So, in the second reaction, B is HCl, which is a strong acid, so that's correct.

Thus, the correct options are:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (from options A or B).

Second reaction: B is HCl (from options A or C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → correct.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → B is incorrect.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, would that work? Like, perhaps NaHSO3 is providing H+ for the acid catalysis. Because HSO3^- is a weak acid. So, maybe H3O+ and NaHSO3 both can act as acids for the first reaction.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. If A is NaHSO3, then the solution would be acidic because NaHSO3 in water would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- is a weak acid (HSO3^- can donate a proton to become SO3^2- or stay as HSO3^-). So, the solution would be slightly acidic. Maybe that's enough for the addition of NaCN to the ketone.

Alternatively, if A is H3O+, which is a stronger acid, it would definitely protonate the carbonyl.

So, whether H3O+ or NaHSO3 could work as A.

But looking at the options, options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, then A would be NaHSO3, and the second reaction would require B as HCl or another acid.

Wait, but for the second reaction, the reagent is B in H2O. So, if B is HCl, then the hydrolysis would proceed. If B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, but would that be sufficient? Maybe, but in the options, option A has B as HCl, which is a stronger acid, so perhaps that's more effective for hydrolysis.

So, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 (A is NaHSO3), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl), then which option fits?

Looking at options:

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → possible.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH → not sure.

Wait, but the first reaction with NaHSO3 and NaCN: would that work?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is a condensation reaction, such as the formation of a cyanohydrin. The presence of an acid like H3O+ is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well, but perhaps not as strong as H3O+.

Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 can act as a source of H+ for this reaction. Because HSO3^- can donate a proton, making the solution acidic enough for the reaction.

But I'm not entirely sure whether NaHSO3 would be sufficient or if a stronger acid is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is better done with H3O+.

In the multiple-choice options, only options A and B have A as H3O+.

So, if the first reaction is H3O+ (A), and the second is HCl (B), then option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction again. So the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. Could it be done with a weak acid like acetic acid? Or does it need a strong acid?

I think that for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, especially when the nitrile is in a hindered position, a strong acid is more effective. So, using HCl would help in the hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together.

First reaction: A is H3O+ (from option A or B).

Second reaction: B is HCl (from option A or C).

Looking at the options, only option A has both A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

So, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acidic environment is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for providing the necessary acidic conditions. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid in the presence of reagent B and water. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Acidic hydrolysis is the most common method for this transformation, and a strong acid like HCl is typically used to facilitate the reaction. Therefore, B = HCl.

Considering the options:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl → Correct, as explained above.
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH → Incorrect, as CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for nitrile hydrolysis.
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl → Incorrect, as NaHSO₃ is not as effective as H₃O⁺ for the first reaction.
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH → Incorrect, as both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
