Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, same peak wavelength for both stars. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. So, I need to compute the luminosity ratio L1/L2. Luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says they radiate as black bodies, so that's the right approach. Okay, so I'll need to find the temperatures of the two stars.

But how? Well, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to the temperature by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So, if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same? Wait, no, because λ_max is same for both, so T must be same. Because λ_max = b/T ⇒ T = b/(λ_max). So if λ_max is same for both, their temperatures T1 and T2 are the same. Oh, so T1 = T2. That's a key point.

So, that simplifies things. Both stars have same temperature.

So, let's write down the luminosity formula for each star.

L1 = 4π R₁² σ T⁴
L2 = 4π R₂² σ T⁴

So the ratio L1/L2 is (R₁² / R₂²) * (T⁴ / T⁴) → R₁² / R₂².

Wait, but wait a minute. But wait, this would be the case if the stars have the same temperature. But is that the case here? Because the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same, which implies same T. So if T is same, then yes, L is proportional to R².

But wait, Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, there's another factor here. The problem mentions radial velocities. Hmm, how does that come into play?

Wait, the question says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does the radial velocity affect the observed wavelength?

Oh right, because the star's light is Doppler shifted. So the observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength. But wait, in the question, it says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But the actual emitted λ_max could be different if the stars are moving.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating the temperatures.

Wait, let me think. The observed peak wavelength depends on the star's velocity. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted.

The Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (in units where c is 1, or in km/s, but we have to be careful with units).

Wait, but wait, the formula is usually λ_observed = λ_rest * (c + v_r)/c, but that's a first-order approximation, valid only when v << c. In reality, the relativistic Doppler effect is more accurate, but for small velocities, the approximation holds.

But wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So 700 is about 0.0023c. So maybe the approximation λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v_r/c) would be okay.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is same for both stars. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away from us, so the observed wavelength is longer. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but wait, let's clarify the Doppler shift formula. If a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so λ_obs > λ_rest. If moving towards, blueshifted, λ_obs < λ_rest.

So for Star_1, since v_r is 0, λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But λ1_rest is λ_max for Star_1, which is b / T1. Similarly, λ2_rest is b / T2.

So, substituting:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

We can cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, because 1/(1 + v2/c) = T2/T1.

Wait, let me rearrange correctly.

Wait, from 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it again.

λ_max, observed = λ_max, rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )

Wait, no, I think the relativistic formula is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is the radial velocity (positive for moving away).

But let's be precise. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But for small v, this approximates to λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c), since sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 -x) ) ≈ 1 + x when x is small.

So, since v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), let's see:

(0.00233) is about 0.233% of c. So the approximation should be okay.

So, for Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

And for Star_1, λ_obs = λ1_rest.

Given that λ_obs for both is same, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

Which gives T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Hmm. So the temperatures are not the same. That's a crucial point I missed earlier.

So, the assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because the observed λ_max is same, but the stars' actual temperatures are different due to Doppler shift.

So, now we have to find T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

Let me compute the ratio T1 / T2.

From above:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v2/c ) ]

Let's compute 1 + v2/c.

v2 is 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So, 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333.

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

So, approximately 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.023333 )

Which is T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 is about 0.977 of T2.

So, T1 is  T2 multiplied by approximately 0.977.

Wait, but then how does this affect the luminosity?

Because luminosity also depends on temperature. So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1/T2 = 0.977 → (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^4.

Hmm. Let's compute step by step.

0.977 squared is approximately:

0.977 * 0.977 ≈ (1 - 0.023)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.9545.

Wait, precise calculation: 0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute 977 * 977.

Well, 977 * 977 = (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000^2 - 2*1000*23 +23² = 1e6 -46e3 + 529 = 954,529.

So, 977^2 =954,529. So, 0.977^2 = (977e-3)^2 = 954529e-6 = 0.954529.

So, approximately 0.9545.

Then, 0.9545 * 0.9545. Let's compute that:

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

But 0.9545 is a bit more.

0.9545^2 = ?

Let me compute 9545 * 9545.

But perhaps it's easier to think of as (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

But maybe just approximate.

Alternatively, 0.9545 * 0.9545 = ?

Let me compute:

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025

0.95 * 0.0045 = 0.004275

0.0045 * 0.95 = 0.004275

0.0045 *0.0045 = 0.00002025

So, adding all terms:

(0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95² + 2*(0.95*.0045) + 0.0045² = 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 = 0.91107025.

Wait, but that would be for (0.9545)^2. No, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's use calculator-like thinking.

Compute 0.9545 * 0.9545:

= (0.95 + 0.0045) * (0.95 +0.0045)

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0045) + 0.0045^2

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105, plus 0.00002025 = 0.91107025.

So, approximately 0.91107.

So, (0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.91107.

Then, (0.9545)^4 is (0.91107)^2.

Compute 0.91107 squared.

0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.

0.9 * 0.01107 = 0.009963.

0.01107 * 0.9 = 0.009963.

0.01107 * 0.01107 ≈ 0.0001225.

So, (0.9 + 0.01107)^2 = 0.9² + 2*0.9*0.01107 + (0.01107)^2

= 0.81 + 0.02007 (approx) + 0.0001225.

So sum is 0.81 + 0.02007 = 0.83007, plus 0.0001225 is ~0.83019.

Wait, but that's 0.91107^2.

Wait, but 0.91107 is around 0.911, so squared would be approximately 0.829.

Wait, 0.91^2 is 0.8281. 0.911^2 is approx 0.911 * 0.911 = 0.829 approx.

So, (0.9545)^4 ≈ 0.829.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.829.

So, now, let's compute L1/L2 ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴/T2⁴) = (2.25) * (0.829) ≈ 2.25 * 0.829.

Compute that:

2 * 0.829 = 1.658

0.25 * 0.829 = 0.20725

Summing 1.658 + 0.20725 = 1.86525.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.829 is 1.86525.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 2.25 * 0.829 is about 1.865, so L1 would be ~1.865 times L2. But the options are all around 2.2 which is much higher.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought T1 and T2 were same, leading to 2.25 factor, but now with T1 lower, I get a lower factor. But the options are higher than that.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation.

Wait, let's reevaluate. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). So, if λ_obs is same for both stars, and Star_2 is moving away, then Star_1's λ_rest must be smaller than Star_2's λ_rest.

Because λ_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature: λ_rest = b / T.

So,

λ1_rest = (b / T1) = [ (b / T2 ) * (1 + v2/c ) ]

So,

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So, T1 is T2 divided by (1 + 0.02333) → 1.02333.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.02333 ) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 is about 0.977 * T2.

So, T1^4 is (0.977)^4 * T2^4.

Wait, but that would lower L1 compared to L2, but according to the options, L1 is larger than L2. So, maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ is longer than its rest λ. But Star_1's observed λ is same as Star_2's observed λ. So Star_1's rest λ must be shorter than Star_2's rest λ because it's not moving.

Because for Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

For Star_1, λ_obs = λ1_rest.

So,

λ1_rest = λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1.02333 )

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature.

So,

λ1_rest = (b / T1 ) = (b / T2 ) * (1.02333 )

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1.02333 ) / T2 → T1 = T2 / 1.02333 → T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 is less than T2.

Which means, L1, which depends on T1^4, would be smaller than L2 (if R were same). But in our case, R1 is larger.

Wait, but L1 is 2.25 * (0.977)^4 times L2.

Which is 2.25 * 0.829 = 1.865 times L2. So L1 is about 1.865 times L2. But the options are about 2.2 times, so this doesn't match.

But wait, the options don't have anything near 1.86. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have used the approximation for the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed λ would be shorter. But I assumed it's moving away. Let me think again.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c). But in that case, the observed λ would be less than λ_rest.

But let's see. For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. The problem says Star_1 has v_r 0, and Star_2 has v_r 700. But radial velocity could be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should consider the magnitude.

Wait, let me think again. So, the observed λ for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

And for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r=0).

They're same, so λ1_rest = λ2_obs = lambda2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_rest is b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b / T2 ) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Take reciprocal:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, that's more accurate. Because the Doppler shift is not linear when velocities are not small. So I think I should use the exact formula here.

So, let's compute that.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

So, v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976666667

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023333333

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333.

Let's compute that.

Compute numerator: 0.9976666667 ≈ 0.9976667.

Denominator: 1.0023333333 ≈ 1.0023333.

So,

0.9976667 / 1.0023333 = ?

Let me compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333.

Hmm, perhaps approximate this as (1 - 0.0023333) / (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ [ (1 - x) / (1 + x) ) ] where x=0.0023333.

We can use the approximation (1 - x)/(1 +x) ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small. Because (1−x)/(1+x) ≈ (1−x)(1−x + x² − ...) ≈ 1−2x for small x.

So,

(1 - x)/(1 +x) ≈ 1 - 2x = 1 - 2*(0.0023333) ) = 1 - 0.0046666 ≈ 0.9953334.

So, the square root of that would be sqrt(0.9953334) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(0.9953) is approximately 0.99765.

Wait, because 0.99765^2 = ?

Compute (0.99765)^2:

= (1 - 0.00235)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00235 + (0.00235)^2 ≈ 1 -0.0047 + 0.0000055 → 0.9953055.

So, yes, sqrt(0.995333) ≈ 0.99765.

So,

sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ 0.99765.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.99765.

So, T1 ≈ 0.99765 T2.

So, T1 is about 0.99765 times T2.

So, the ratio T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.99765)^4.

Compute 0.99765^2 first.

0.99765 * 0.99765 ≈ (1 - 0.00235)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00235 + (0.00235)^2 → 1 - 0.0047 + 0.0000055 ≈ 0.9953055.

Then, (0.99765)^4 = (0.9953055)^2.

Compute 0.9953055^2.

= (1 - 0.0046945)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046945 + (0.0046945)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009389 + 0.00002198 → 0.990632.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990632.

So, L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T2^4) = (2.25) * (0.990632) ≈ 2.25 * 0.990632 ≈ 2.226.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, the rest-frame peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\) (since its radial velocity \(v_r = 0\)). For Star_2, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}\), where \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\).

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T\), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) gives \(v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333\). Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}}
\]

Using the approximation \((1 - x)/(1 + x) \approx 1 - 2x\) for small \(x\), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \sqrt{1 - 2(0.002333)} = \sqrt{0.995334} \approx 0.99765
\]

Thus, \(T_1 \approx 0.99765 \cdot T_2\).

### Step 3: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \(R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2\), so:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99765)^4
\]

First, compute \((0.99765)^2 \approx 0.9953\). Then, \((0.9953)^2 \approx 0.9906\). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9906
\]

Finally, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9906 \approx 2.226
\]

### Step 4: Matching the Closest Option
The calculated luminosity ratio of \(2.226\) is closest to option **D) ~2.23**.

Answer: D
