Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, it's about how the number of stars varies with distance. The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is 1 over distance (d), so plx = 1/d. Or wait, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is approximately 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if distance d increases, parallax plx decreases.

The given relation is number of stars N varies as 1/(plx^5). So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). But plx is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. Let me substitute that in. So N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) ^5 ) which is same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if N increases as d^5, then how does the number of stars per unit distance (like a differential) change? Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of a differential element.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number density, the number per unit volume or per unit distance? Wait, in a region of the sky, assuming that the region is a thin slice, the number of stars depends on both the area (which is constant for a given region) and the depth (distance). So maybe it's more about how the number of stars within a certain distance range changes.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the rate of change of N with respect to d. Let me think about differentials. If N = k * d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit change in d would be proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of r, which I think is distance. So per unit r, the change is proportional to r^4? Or is it the number per unit volume or per something else?

Wait, another approach. Let's model it. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is N = f(plx) * (the volume element, but wait, in a given solid angle, the number of stars would depend on the depth in that direction. So perhaps for a fixed area, the number of stars in a thin slice (like a shell) at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d^2 * dd. Wait, no, that's more about the flux or the density. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me go back. The number of stars varies with 1/(plx^5), so N = C / plx^5, where C is a constant. Plx is 1/d, so N = C * d^5. So N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in that region increases rapidly with distance.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, perhaps it's the gradient of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5C d^4. So the change in N for a small change in d is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases by roughly d^4 per unit change in d.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options directly. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Wait, so if the change is proportional to r^4, then the answer would be C.

But I'm a bit confused. Another way: Let's consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. Assuming the region is a specific area, the volume of the shell is approximately area * 4π d^2 dr? No, wait, no. Wait, in a specific region of the sky, which is a certain solid angle. So for a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars would be the number per unit volume times the volume of the shell. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N = C / plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = C d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in that region is increasing rapidly with distance.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So for a small change in distance, how much does N change? dN = 5 C d^4 dr. So the change per unit dr is proportional to d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars changes as d^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with distance, not the rate. Or perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of stars per unit distance interval, which would be the derivative dN/dd. Since N ∝ d^5, dN/dd =5 d^4, so the number increases as ~ r^4 per unit r.

So yes, the answer should be option C.

The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. This implies considering the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), or \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as \( r^4 \), where \( r \) is the distance.

Among the options provided:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship is not cubic in \( r \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this describes the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship is not quadratic in \( r \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance interval increases proportionally to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
