Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me start by breaking down what's happening in each step.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I think is a carbonyl group. So, probably an elimination reaction happened here. When dibromides react with KOH, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. But wait, in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So heating with KOH would likely cause elimination, creating an alkene. But since it's an adamantane structure, the elimination would form an exo-cyclic double bond, maybe something like a bicyclic system with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a triplet. That's probably a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Wait, no, because the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an epoxide. Hmm, wait no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around 2.1 ppm which I usually associate with a CH2 adjacent to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides typically have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but in the NMR, it's at 4.79 for two protons. That could fit, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH. So each Br is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 are positions in adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure. So, when KOH is used, the two Br atoms would be eliminated to form a double bond. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but elimination from a dihalide typically gives an alkene, not a carbonyl. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, unless the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with excess KOH, elimination is more likely. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a vicinal dihalide, so eliminating would form a double bond, but the product's IR doesn't reflect that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a different reaction, maybe a substitution. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with high thermal stability. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's a bridged bicyclic structure with Br atoms on two bridgeheads. So, when treated with KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of a double bond across the bridge. So the product would be an adamantene (with a double bond) called 1,3-adamantadiene or similar. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl peak. Oh, maybe it's not that.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't just elimination. Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing an oxidation? No, I don't think KOH would oxidize in this way.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is an epoxide. Wait, but how would that form from a dihalide? Oh wait, no, that's not the case. Epoxides form from alcohols or alkenes under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on the first part, but let me think about the subsequent steps. Then maybe I can backtrack.

So product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is usually a Lewis acid catalyst, used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 is a di-elimination product, perhaps an alkene. If product 1 is an alkene, then Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply. Unless product 1 is actually a ketone, which would make more sense for Friedel-Crafts. Wait, but how would product 1 be a ketone?

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine. 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's leading to an E2 elimination, removing two Brs and forming a double bond. So product 1 would be an alkene, specifically 1,3-diene in adamantane, which would have a structure with a double bond. But the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a triplet. Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. But wait, if it's an alkene, the protons on the double bond would typically be around 5-6 ppm as triplets or something else, but depending on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is not an alkene. Let me think again about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet) might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or part of an epoxide. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, and they would typically be a quartet or triplet depending on neighboring groups. But in this case, it's a triplet, so maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, like in an epoxide ring where each CH2 is next to another CH2.

Wait, but how would an epoxide form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? That's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but I don't see how with a vicinal dihalide. Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How could that form from the dihalide? Oh, wait, maybe it's a Corey-Fuchs reaction or some kind of elimination to form a ketone. Hmm, but I can't recall a specific reaction like that.

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Perhaps via a dehydrohalogenation that forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but for that, I think the dihalide would have to be adjacent, but in this case, the dihalide is on 1 and 3 positions of adamantane, which are bridgehead positions. So maybe elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring? No, that's not applicable.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm is 2H as a triplet. Maybe it's a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen. So, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. How would that happen? Oh! Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo epoxidation if there's an oxidizing agent, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH leads to a ring-opening, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me move to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is reacted with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an acylium ion or something else. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for introducing alkyl or acyl groups into aromatic rings. So product 1 must have an aromatic ring? But the starting material is adamantane, which is an aliphatic compound. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, which under Friedel-Crafts conditions might undergo some kind of acylation.

Wait, but what if product 1 is a bicyclic compound with an aromatic ring? No, because adamantane is a diamondoid, which isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring or something else where Friedel-Crafts could apply. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about what product 3 is. The steps after product 1 involve ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of product 2, which is treated with ozone at -78C, and then worked up with dimethyl sulfide. That usually leads to cleavage of double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond that upon ozonolysis breaks into smaller carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, so product 2 is reacted with ozone. So product 2 is an alkene. But how? Let's retrace: Product 1 is reacted with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2. If product 1 is an alkene, then perhaps product 2 is a di-substituted alkene or something else.

Wait, maybe let me outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm^-1, NMR as given).
2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2.
3. Product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after workup).

In step 3, ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond.

But step 1's product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Hmm, Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used to facilitate Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene? How? Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a diene.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 (2H, triplet) could be a CH2O group, maybe part of a ketone's structure. Wait, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide with a CH2 group next to an oxygen, as in an epoxide ring. Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, maybe it undergoes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Epoxides can open under acid conditions. But what would that give?

Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, then product 2 would be an alcohol or a diol, which wouldn't have a double bond. But then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first step again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's not elimination but substitution. But with two bromines, substitution would be more likely to form something else. Wait, maybe it's an example of a double substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a geminal diol, but that's when two OH groups are substituted, which doesn't fit the IR data.

Alternatively, wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must contain a carbonyl group. Which type? Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, etc. Since it's a solid and the starting material is adamantane, it's probably an aliphatic ketone.

So if product 1 is a ketone, then how did it form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, that's possible. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but for a dihalide to form a ketone, perhaps it's a case of elimination followed by some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is oxidized. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (they are usually around 3200-3600 cm^-1), so that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces elimination, but forms a carbonyl through a different mechanism. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to an allene or another structure that can tautomerize into a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridgehead carbonyl. For example, elimination could form a carbonyl group instead of a double bond. But how? Because elimination usually forms alkenes, not carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 (2H, triplet) is the only peak that's not in the multiplet. The other peaks are 2.41-2.23 (10H, probably from CH2 groups in the adamantane structure), 1.94 (2H, maybe another CH2).

If the 4.79 ppm peak is a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps it's an ether, like OCH2CH2O or similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. So, for example, the structure might have an epoxide ring in the adamantane framework. In that case, the two protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen would resonate around 4.5-4.7 ppm, which fits the NMR data. So the triplet at 4.79 would correspond to the two protons on the epoxide ring, each coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an epoxide upon treatment with KOH? That doesn't seem right. Epoxides typically form from alcohols under acidic conditions or from alkenes via peracids. So maybe I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But I'm not sure how that would form from the dihalide. Maybe it's a double elimination, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, could the product be a bicyclic ether, like an epoxide? Let me think about the structure again. Adamantane is a diamondoid, and 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on two bridgehead positions. If KOH causes elimination of HBr twice, perhaps forming a bridgehead double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihalides) undergo dehydrohalogenation, they form alkenes. But the starting material is a 1,3-dihalide, so elimination would form a conjugated diene. Wait, but in a bridged structure, elimination might form a bridgehead double bond, which is possible in adamantane.

So product 1 could be an alkene, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene. But then the IR would show C=C absorption around 1650 cm^-1, not 1720. So that can't be right. Unless I'm misunderstanding the IR data.

Wait, the IR is 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is an example of a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted to a ketone via a different mechanism. I'm not recalling this specific reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait, but in some cases, elimination can lead to carbonyl formation if there's a peroxide or other oxidizing agent, but here it's KOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 has a carbonyl group in a bridgehead. For example, a bridgehead ketone. How would that form from the dihalide?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted to a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. Wait, but if two OH groups are present on adjacent carbons, perhaps they could lose two water molecules to form a double bond, but that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm really stuck on this first step. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. Wait, I recall that when 1,2-dihaloalkanes are treated with a base, they form alkenes. But for 1,3-dihalo, perhaps it's different. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the IR of product 1 is 1720, which is close to the carbonyl of a ketone (usually around 1715 cm^-1). So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR data supports that.

The NMR shows 4.79 (2H, triplet). If it's a ketone, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, like (CH2)CO. But in that case, the CH2 would be around 2.1 ppm as a quartet or something else. But in this case, it's at 4.79, which is more like an oxygen-bearing CH2, like OCH2CH2O.

Wait, but that would be an ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ether like a THF ring, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. So, the structure would have an O connecting two bridgehead carbons. The two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen would each have two protons, which would resonate around 4.79 as a triplet. So the triplet arises because each proton is coupling with two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

If that's the case, then product 1 is an epoxide. Then, moving to the next step: product 1 is treated with excess Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid. Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions. So in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3, the epoxide would open to form a diol, but that's if the conditions are acidic. Alternatively, maybe it forms a carbocation.

Wait, but if the epoxide opens to form a diol, then product 2 would have OH groups, but that doesn't fit with the next step being ozonolysis. Because ozonolysis requires a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening forms a carbocation, which could rearrange or form a new structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 isn't an epoxide but a ketone. Let's say product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, a Friedel-Crafts alkylation occurs. But product 1 doesn't have an aromatic ring. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 undergoes some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. If the IR is 1720, that could be an ester carbonyl. Then, treating with Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to some acylation. But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. So the NMR of product 3 would depend on the structure of product 2.

If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, and the structure of product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely to be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So in product 3, perhaps there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, or a CH group in a conjugated system.

But without knowing exactly what's going on in the earlier steps, it's hard to pin down.

Wait, maybe I can work backward. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H is probably near a carbonyl group, maybe in a methylene or methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

A triplet would mean coupling with two equivalent neighboring H's. A triplet of triplets would be coupling with two different sets of H's. A pentet would be coupling with four H's, maybe in a -CH2CH2- situation.

Wait, if the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and it's coupled with another CH2 group, perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, but that's assuming product 3 has such a structure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, suppose product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis of product 2 would form carbonyl groups. If the alkene is symmetric, like a trans or cis di-substituted alkene, the ozonolysis would break it into two identical carbonyl compounds.

But if the alkene is unsymmetric, then product 3 would have two different carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the question specifies product 3 is a single product, I think. So perhaps product 2 is a symmetrical diene, leading to a single product after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis forms a diketone or similar.

Wait, but the exact structure is still unclear.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 undergoes ring-opening to form a carbocation, which then rearranges or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylium ion or something else that, when ozonized, forms a specific product.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I can't figure out what product 1 is. Let me try to think of it another way.

The IR of product 1 is 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is definitely a carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's think about what structures have 2H as a triplet. One possibility is a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen in an epoxide, as I thought earlier. Another possibility is a CH2 next to a carbonyl group in a ketone. Wait, but that would usually be around 2.1 ppm, not 4.79.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a methylene group in an ester. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-O-R', but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet is part of a carbonyl group's neighboring structure. Wait, maybe it's an acetate group or something else.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's an acyloin or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But the NMR shows only a single triplet, so perhaps it's a single ketone group.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bridged ketone, such as a bicyclo structure with a ketone. The CH2 group in the bridge could be at 4.79, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm peak corresponds to a methylene group in a bridgehead, which is deshielded due to the ring structure. But that doesn't directly explain the triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 peak is from a CH2 group adjacent to an ether oxygen, making it an epoxide. So product 1 is an epoxide, and the 4.79 peak is the two protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen.

Moving forward, if product 1 is an epoxide, then treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 (a Lewis acid) would catalyze the opening of the epoxide. Epoxide ring-opening typically occurs under acid conditions, leading to the formation of a diol. But wait, Al(i-Pr)3 is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it polarizes the epoxide, making it more reactive.

But then, product 2 would be a diol, which doesn't have a double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. That can't be right because the next step uses ozonolysis.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about product 1 being an epoxide. So back to step one: maybe product 1 is a ketone, and the 4.79 peak is something else.

Wait, the NMR also has 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), which suggests multiple CH2 groups in the adamantane framework. So product 1's structure must still be based on adamantane with some substituents.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, but the given IR only shows one at 1720. So maybe it's a single ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol ether, but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters and forms rings. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a lactone, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1 has 4.79 (2H, triplet). Let's think about what kind of coupling would lead to a triplet. A triplet arises when a proton is coupled with two equivalent neighboring protons. For example, in a -CH2-CH2- structure, the middle CH2 protons would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2.

So if product 1 has a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups, that could explain the triplet. But how does that fit with the IR and the rest?

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 peak is from a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether. So for example, a structure like CH2-O-CH2 in an epoxide would have the CH2 protons as a triplet. Because each proton on the CH2 is next to two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 is formed by treating this epoxide with Al(i-Pr)3. Under acidic conditions, the epoxide would open. But what would that give? If it's a cyclic epoxide, the ring-opening would form a diol. But then product 2 would have an alcohol group, which would have broad peaks in the NMR, but the question doesn't provide NMR data for product 2.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis requires a double bond. So product 2 must have a double bond. That suggests that after opening the epoxide, product 2 has a double bond.

How could that happen? Maybe the epoxide opening under acidic conditions forms a carbocation, which then undergoes a hydride shift or some rearrangement to form a double bond.

For example, if the epoxide ring opens to form a carbocation at a bridgehead, which is not stable, so it might undergo a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation, which could then lose a proton to form a double bond.

So, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via this mechanism. Then, when ozone is bubbled through product 2, it cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is, in product 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen?

Assuming product 3 is a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups, the deshielded H would be near a carbonyl. For example, a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In such a case, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, it could have a different coupling pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, what would the splitting look like?

Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group would be adjacent to two different groups, perhaps leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H would be split into a triplet due to coupling with two H on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2, then each H on the CH2 would have coupling with two H's from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the coupling would be more complex. For example, a CH2 next to a CH would have each H coupling with the two H's on the CH2 and the two H's on the CH, leading to a quintet or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH, then each H on the CH2 would couple with the H's on the CH and possibly others, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

But the options include a pentet (option D), which would come from coupling with four equivalent H's. That would happen if the CH2 is next to a CH2CH2 group or something similar.

Alternatively, a triplet of triplets would arise from coupling with two different sets of H's, each with two H's.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a geminal di-substitution, but that's unlikely.

Wait, let's think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group adjacent to each carbonyl. The CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyls, leading to their H's being deshielded.

Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent only to each other, so each H would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

So in product 3, the most deshielded H (in the CH2 next to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2, then each H could couple with four H's (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a pentet.

But that depends on the structure.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another angle: the most deshielded H is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with two H's on that adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

But wait, another possibility: the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But if the CH is not equivalent, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2. Then, each H would couple with two H's from each adjacent CH2, causing a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets as option B. So this could be possible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose product 3 has a structure like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-O=C-R'

In this case, the CH2 groups are between two carbonyls. Each H on the central CH2 would be coupling with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 groups on either side. So each H would see two neighboring H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, if the two adjacent groups are identical, the coupling would be a triplet. But if the adjacent groups are different, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two different groups, leading to two different coupling constants, hence a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another possibility: if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, then each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH and two on the other side. But that would result in a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, which would have a different coupling pattern.

Wait, in the NMR of product 3, what's the most deshielded H? It would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So likely, it's in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

If that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2, then each H would have coupling with two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of an example. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose the diene was in a bridge structure, such that ozonolysis creates two carbonyl groups with a CH2 group in between.

So the structure would be O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R'-C=O.

In this case, the CH2 groups between the two carbonyls would each have protons that are adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, that's more for each CH2 group. For the central CH2, the coupling would be with two H's on each side, leading to four couplings, which would be a pentet.

Wait, no. Wait, each H on the central CH2 is next to two H's on the left and two on the right. So each H is coupled with four H's in total (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet.

Hmm, that would make option D (pentet) the correct answer.

But in reality, the coupling constants may not be the same on both sides. If the left and right coupling constants are different, then each H would have two different coupling partners, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of symmetric structures, like if R and R' are the same, the coupling constants would be the same, leading to a quintet. However, if R and R' are different, the coupling constants would differ, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Given that product 1 was derived from a symmetric structure (1,3-dibromoadamantane), product 2 is likely symmetric as well. Thus, product 3 would have symmetric carbonyl groups, leading to a symmetric CH2 group in between.

Therefore, the CH2 group in product 3 would be between two identical carbonyl groups, making the coupling constants on both sides the same. Thus, each H would couple with four H's (two on each side), leading to a quintet.

Wait, but wait. The coupling is between adjacent H's. So in the structure O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R'-C=O, the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two H's on the left and two on the right. So each H would have four neighboring H's, leading to a quintet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is in a position where each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other, leading to a quintet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a pentet.

Looking at the options, option D is pentet.

Wait, but the options don't have a quintet; the option is D) pentet. So that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent only to one CH2, so the coupling would be a triplet.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the number of neighboring H's.

If the H in question is in a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups, each with two H's, then each H would be next to four H's (two on each side). So, the splitting would result in a quintet (n+1 rule, where n=4, so 5 peaks). But that's a pentet, option D.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is only next to one CH2 group, then each H would see two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But in the case where the structure is symmetric, like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R-C=O, the central CH2 is between two identical CH2 groups. So each H on the central CH2 sees two H's on each side, leading to four couplings. Thus, a quintet is the expected splitting.

But wait, in reality, the two adjacent groups may not be identical, so the coupling constants may differ, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But given the starting material's symmetry, product 3 is likely to be symmetric as well. So the CH2 group would have identical coupling on both sides, leading to a quintet.

So the answer would be D) pentet.

But wait, another thought: in the ozonolysis of a diene, the resulting product would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. If the diene was 1,3-diene in a bridged system, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups with a CH2 group in between.

Thus, the structure would be something like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R-C=O

So, the central CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two H's on each side, leading to a total of four neighboring H's. Therefore, each H would split into a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks).

So, the coupling pattern is a pentet, option D.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. The NMR data for product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is consistent with a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, likely in an epoxide or ether-like structure. However, the IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone rather than an epoxide. Thus, product 1 is likely a ketone derived from the elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with Al(i-Pr)₃
Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction that introduces a double bond into the structure, forming product 2. The exact mechanism is unclear, but product 2 must contain a double bond since ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Therefore, product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved.

### Step 4: NMR Analysis of product 3
The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. Based on the reaction sequence, product 3 could have a structure where a CH₂ group is flanked by two carbonyl groups. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group would couple with four equivalent hydrogens (two on each adjacent CH₂ group), resulting in a **pentet** (a quintet) splitting pattern.

### Critical Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with two equivalent neighboring hydrogens, which is unlikely given the expected structure.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with two sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, which is less likely due to the symmetry of the starting material.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with two different sets of hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the expected symmetric structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This is consistent with the CH₂ group flanked by two CH₂ groups, where each hydrogen couples with four equivalent hydrogens, leading to a quintet.

### Conclusion
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **pentet** coupling pattern due to its position between two CH₂ groups, each contributing two equivalent hydrogens.
