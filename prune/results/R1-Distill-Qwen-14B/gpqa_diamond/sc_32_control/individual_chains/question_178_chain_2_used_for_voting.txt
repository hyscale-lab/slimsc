Okay, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me think step by step.

First, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I remember that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ=c=1). So each term should be dimension 4.

Wait, wait, no—the Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4? Because when you integrate it (d^4x), the action becomes dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian has [Lagrangian term] = 4.

Now, let's break down the components of L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have the same dimension as [κ^{-1}] because [κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

Wait, no, wait: The entire term is L = κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, but each component's dimension needs to be considered.

I think I should find the mass dimensions of each field and object in the term.

First, what's the dimension of ψ (the Dirac spinor)? For a Dirac fermion, ψ has dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the action for the Dirac equation is S = ∫ L d^4x, and the kinetic term is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ] =4. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1.

So ψ̄ has [ψ̄] = 3/2. Similarly, ψ has [ψ] =3/2. Because ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is defined as (i/2)[γμ, γν]. So σ is a commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So [σ] =0.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, right? So F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + ... but for electromagnetism, the field strength tensor F has the same dimension as the electromagnetic field A. Wait, no: the field tensor F_{μν} is made from derivatives of A. Let's think. The Maxwell term is F^2, which in the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So F^2 has dimension 4 → [F]^2 = [Lagrangian] =4 → [F] =2. Because F is a tensor, which has two indices, but the dimension is per component. So each component of F has dimension 2.

Wait, wait, let's clarify. The Maxwell term is -(1/4) F^{μν} F_{μν}, which is (F^2) and has dimension 4. So each F is dimension 2. Because F^2 → [F]^2=4 → [F]=2.

So [F^{μν}] =2.

Putting it all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F.

So their dimensions: [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2.

Adding those up: [κ] + 3/2 +3/2 = [κ] + 3. Then plus 2 from F → [κ] +5.

Wait, let me compute: [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = (3/2) +0 + (3/2) +2 = 3/2 + 3/2 =3, plus 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is option A or C.

Now, the second part: Is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait: the mass dimension of the coupling is determined by [L] =4.

Wait, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥0. Because the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - n [g], where d is spacetime dimension (4) and n is the number of coupling constants in a Feynman diagram. For a theory to be renormalizable, D must be positive only for a finite number of diagrams, meaning that the coupling constants should have mass dimension ≤ (4 - d) which for d=4 is 0. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think: in 4 dimensions, a coupling constant κ has dimension [κ] = (4 - (sum of fields in the term)). For the interaction term to have dimension 4, each term must have [coupling] + sum [fields] =4.

If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, that implies the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because perturbation theory would bring in higher and higher loop corrections, making the theory not predictive at higher energies.

In this case, [κ] =-1, which is negative. So the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Because the dimension is negative, implying that the coupling becomes relevant (or irrelevant?) in the RG flow.

Wait, another way: The general rule is that a coupling with positive mass dimension is relevant (so the theory is renormalizable), and negative makes it non-renormalizable.

So here, [κ]=-1, which is negative, so the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait: Let's check other sources. For example, in QED, the coupling is e, which has [e]=1. Because the interaction term is e ψ̄ γ^μ A_μ ψ. So [e] is 1, which is positive, so QED is renormalizable.

In this problem, κ has [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory can't be renormalizable because the coupling has dimension -1, which is less than zero. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renorm. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renorm. So correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu\right]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields and objects
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for electromagnetism has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:

\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]

Substituting the dimensions of the fields:

\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the coupling constant becomes irrelevant at high energies, leading to an infinite number of counterterms.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
