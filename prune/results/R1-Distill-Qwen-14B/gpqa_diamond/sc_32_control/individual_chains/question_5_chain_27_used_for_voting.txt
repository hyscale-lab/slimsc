Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of an operator along a certain direction. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking at a muon. The direction in question is an arbitrary vector n lying in the x-z plane. Oh right, so that means n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because anything in the x-z plane has y-component zero.

And we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so the operator P along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices, I think. So P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Oh wait, no, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the same as the eigenvalue of the spin operator S for spin-up. So P is the momentum operator here, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Maybe it's similar to the spin angular momentum operator.

But the key is that the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvector will depend on the direction of n.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation would involve P. So maybe I can write P as a combination of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the direction components.

Alternatively, since n is in the x-z plane, perhaps we can parametrize it with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. So that would make sense.

So, substituting that into the operator P:

P = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) σx + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) σz.

Wait, wait. No, because P is the operator, so it's the sum of nx Px + nz Pz. Px is (ħ/2) σx, same for Pz. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz).

But n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ because n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) (since it's in the x-z plane). So:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ]

Now, the eigenvalue for the eigenstate we're looking for is +ħ/2. So, the equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which can be written as:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me write that matrix out:

The matrix is:
[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Wait, no. Let me compute the elements:

The first element (1,1) is cosθ because it's the (1,1) element of cosθ * σz, which is cosθ * 1, and σx's (1,1) is 0. So 0 + cosθ = cosθ.

The (1,2) element is sinθ because σx's (1,2) is 1, multiplied by sinθ, and σz's (1,2) is 0. So sinθ.

Similarly, the (2,1) element is sinθ, because σx's (2,1) is 1 * sinθ, and σz's is 0.

The (2,2) element is -cosθ, because σz's (2,2) is -1 * cosθ, and σx's (2,2) is 0.

So the matrix is:

| cosθ     sinθ   |
| sinθ    -cosθ |

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ cosθ     sinθ ] |a>   = |a>
[ sinθ    -cosθ ] |b>     |b>

Which can be written as two equations:

1. cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2. sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rearrange these equations.

From equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
From equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Wait, or perhaps I can subtract a and b from the right-hand side.

Equation 1: (cosθ) a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ) b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Now, these are two equations. Let me write in matrix form:

[ (cosθ -1)    sinθ       ] [a]   = [0]
[   sinθ      (-cosθ -1) ] [b]     [0]

For non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Compute determinant:

Determinant = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)
= [ (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1) ] - sin²θ
Wait, perhaps expanding directly:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ + 1
= -cos²θ + 0 +1
= 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ

So determinant becomes sin²θ - (sinθ)^2 = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0 → which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors.

So the two equations are dependent, and we can use one of them to find the relation between a and b.

Let's take equation 1: (cosθ -1)a + sinθ b = 0 → sinθ b = (1 - cosθ) a → b = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] a

Hmm, let me simplify (1 - cosθ)/sinθ. I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ) ] = tan(θ/2)

So b = tan(θ/2) a

So the ratio of b to a is tan(θ/2). Let me set a = 1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple). Then b = tan(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [a; b] = [1; tan(θ/2)]

But wait, let me think again. The eigenvector can be written as [1, tan(θ/2)]^T. To normalize this vector, we'll compute its magnitude.

The magnitude squared is 1^2 + [tan(θ/2)]^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) → magnitude is |sec(θ/2)| = 1 / |cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T multiplied by cos(θ/2) ? Wait, let's see.

Wait, because when you have [1; tan(θ/2)] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] / cos(θ/2) → because 1 / cos(θ/2) is 1 / cos(θ/2), and tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2). So the vector can be written as [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T multiplied by (1 / cos(θ/2)).

So to normalize, we divide by the magnitude. The magnitude squared is (1/cos²(θ/2)) (cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2)) ) = (1/cos²(θ/2)) (1) )= 1/cos²(θ/2). So the magnitude is 1 / |cos(θ/2)|.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me write the vector as:

[ a, b ] = [ 1, tan(θ/2) ]

So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = sqrt( sec²(θ/2) ) = |sec(θ/2)| = 1 / |cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] if θ is between 0 and π, which it is for polar angles.

Wait, because (1 / cos(θ/2)) * [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [1, tan(θ/2)], right? So the normalized vector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, but wait: [ a, b ] = [ 1, tan(θ/2) ] / sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2))

Which is [ 1, tan(θ/2) ] / (1 / cos(θ/2)) )

Which equals [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Because 1 / (1 / cos(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2), and tan(θ/2) / (1/cos(θ/2)) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Which aligns with option C: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have.

But wait, what about the normalization? Let me check.

The vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] has magnitude sqrt( cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) = sqrt(1) = 1. So it's already normalized.

So the elements are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, let me look at the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar and some theta/2 terms. Hmm, but where would those factors come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different approach, perhaps using the expectation values or something else. Hmm, but no, from the way I did the calculation, it seems to come out to option C.

Wait, but the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the eigenvector is in terms of theta, which is the angle from the z-axis. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but the way I derived it, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, so the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) which is spherical coordinates, but in this problem phi is zero because the direction is in x-z plane (so phi=0).

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I calculated.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the expressions for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right).
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:

\[
\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z = 1.
\]

The matrix representation of $\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z$ is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to two equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, we find the ratio of $b$ to $a$:

\[
b = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

Choosing $a = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this vector, we calculate its magnitude squared:

\[
1^2 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options either include unnecessary factors (e.g., $\hbar$) or describe unnormalized or incorrectly parameterized vectors.
