Okay, so I have this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that could modify the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries must all operators respect?

The question gives four options, 1 through 4. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. SMEFT operators must definitely respect this because they are part of a relativistic theory. So 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, because SMEFT is a field theory, it's built in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. So operators should respect that too. So 2 is also a must. So points 1 and 2 are in.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. Wait, do all SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I'm not so sure. Because the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry beyond what's imposed by the operators. Wait, wait, no, the SM actually has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT's operators wouldn't necessarily have to either. So maybe 3 isn't a required symmetry. Or is it?

Wait, but when building SMEFT, you have to include all possible operators that are allowed by the symmetries of the SM. The SM itself doesn't have CP symmetry, but the SMEFT operators must be invariant under the SM's gauge group and other symmetries. Wait, but CP is an accidental symmetry in some cases. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The SM has some CP violation, so SMEFT doesn't have to enforce CP symmetry because the SM doesn't. So 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that SMEFT operators must respect. So 3 might not be required.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal is a symmetry in all relativistic quantum field theories. So all the operators in SMEFT, being part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so do the SMEFT operators respect both? Or is Poincare automatically included if Lorentz is? Because I think Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant and translation invariant. So in SMEFT, operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry. So when the question asks which must be respected, the correct ones are 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT), but wait, Lorentz is part of Poincare. So the question lists Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) as separate options.

Wait, wait. So the question is which symmetries must all operators respect. So if the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, they automatically respect Lorentz symmetry, right? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So for the SMEFT, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which in turn implies Lorentz symmetry. So perhaps the correct answer includes 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT). Wait, but the options have 1 and 2 as separate choices.

Wait, but the options are 1,2,3,4, and the possible answers are combinations. Let me go back to the options in the question. The options are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

So the question is which must be respected by all operators. So, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies Lorentz, because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But the question is phrased as separate options.

Wait, but perhaps I was wrong earlier. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must respect Lorentz, but do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare is about spacetime translations. But the effective theory is constructed in a way that the operators are local, so they must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincare. So when the question asks which must be respected, both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are required.

Wait, but I thought that Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So if you have an operator that's Poincare-invariant, then it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. So if the operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically satisfied. So the question is, which of the options must be respected.

So the options are in the question as four separate points. If all operators must respect Poincare, then 2 is a must, which implies 1 is automatically a must. But the answer options have 1 and 2 as separate choices. So looking at the options given:

Options are:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

Wait, but if all operators respect Poincare (2), which implies Lorentz (1), then in the answer, both 1 and 2 are included. For example, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but I thought CPT is a must because of the theory being Lorentz-invariant, so 4 must be included. So, which operators are needed?

So the answer must include Poincare (2), Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). Wait, but 1 is included in 2. So in that case, the correct answer would have 2 and 4, but looking at the options, option C has 1,2,4. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why would Lorentz symmetry (1) be a required symmetry if Poincare (2) is already required? Because if the operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz.

So the question is, which of the four symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the correct ones would be 2 (Poincare), which implies 1, and 4 (CPT).

Looking at the options, none of the options have 2 and 4. Option C is 1,2,4. So including both 1 and 2. Alternatively, perhaps 1 and 2 are both required because the SMEFT is built to respect both? Or perhaps they are separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Also, since it's a Poincare-invariant theory, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Additionally, CPT symmetry is a must because it's a requirement of Lorentz-invariant theories. So 4 is correct.

So the four symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So the correct answer is option C, which is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So in the list, 2 implies 1. So if the question is which must be respected, and 2 is one of them, then perhaps 1 is redundant.

But the options are given as separate options. So the question is, which of these symmetries must the operators respect. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare (so 2), which implies Lorentz (1), and also CPT (4). So the correct answer includes 2 and 4, plus 1 because 2 includes 1.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the SM has CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is an effective theory extending the SM, it must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and so is SMEFT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Also, since they're part of a Poincare-invariant theory, they must respect Poincare. So 1 and 2 must be respected. Plus, CPT must be respected because it's a requirement of Lorentz symmetry in quantum field theories. So 4 is also a must.

So the answer includes 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in SMEFT, operators are classified based on their dimension and the symmetries they respect. Do they only need to respect Lorentz and gauge symmetries of the SM, or also CPT?

I think that in effective field theories, CPT is automatically respected if the theory is built respecting Lorentz and other symmetries. So the operators must respect CPT.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This symmetry ensures invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts).

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. Since SMEFT is built as a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry (1) is automatically included if Poincaré symmetry (2) is respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model (SM) already includes CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), so SMEFT operators do not need to enforce CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any relativistic quantum field theory, CPT symmetry (a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal) must be respected. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. While Poincaré symmetry (2) implies Lorentz symmetry (1), both are explicitly listed in the options. Therefore, the correct answer is the combination of 1, 2, and 4.
