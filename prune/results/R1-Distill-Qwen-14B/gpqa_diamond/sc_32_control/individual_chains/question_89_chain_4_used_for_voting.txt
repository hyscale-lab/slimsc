Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through solution 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

First, I need to figure out what each step does. Let's break it down.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically an E2 mechanism, forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are three bonds apart. Hmm, that's two carbons apart. Wait, no, let me think. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, so 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Oh wait, no, the structure of adamantane has each carbon connected to three others, so maybe 1 and 3 are bridgeheads but not adjacent. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, but the product after KOH is a solid. The NMR data given is for product 1. Their 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. The IR peak suggests a carbonyl group. Oh wait, because 1720 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. But wait, the starting material is a dihalide. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if both are eliminated, maybe it forms a diene? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, which is a strong base, elimination is more likely.

Wait, but elimination of two bromides would form a double bond. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, getting rid of two HBr molecules would form a diene? Because the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3. So eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C2 and C3? Wait, no, that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some bridge being formed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but that would require an oxygen, which isn't present here. Oh, wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. So how could that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is acting as a base, but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dielimination to form a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But with two bromines, maybe it's undergoing a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base and not a nucleophile in elimination reactions. So perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, maybe the elimination forms an alkene, but if that's not the case, perhaps the bromides are in positions that, upon elimination, form a bridge with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a crown ether or something else. Wait, no, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three others. So 1 and 3 would be opposite each other on the structure. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the molecule is so rigid that the elimination forms a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the two bromide groups are on adjacent bridgeheads, so when each is eliminated, the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but because the molecule is rigid, this might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone. Wait, elimination of two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone. So perhaps the product after KOH treatment is a ketone. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, maybe each bromide is replaced by a hydroxide, but that's substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so maybe elimination is more likely, but then how does a carbonyl form?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but dehydrohalogenation usually forms alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a case of eliminating two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, and the loss of two HBr leads to the formation of a ketone. For example, if the structure after elimination has a carbonyl group.

Wait, how? Let me think of a simple example. Suppose we have a vicinal dihalide, like 1,2-dibromoethane. KOH would eliminate to form ethylene. But if the dihalide is 1,2-dibromo-1-phenylethane, elimination would form a phenyl group attached to a double bond. But in this case, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a ring contraction, forming a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on bridgehead carbons of adamantane. If each is eliminated, perhaps the bridge breaks, and a carbonyl forms.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH, but then the product would have two OH groups, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But epoxides have a three-membered ring and a peak around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O-C stretch. The given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? But how from a dihalide?

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double nucleophilic substitution with the hydroxide, replacing Br with OH groups. But then you'd have a diol. But the IR peak doesn't fit a diol.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder-like elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That region is typically for -OH protons, but wait, 4.79 is a bit downfield for an alcohol. Alternatively, it could be an ether, but the other peaks might suggest something else. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely for the adamantane ring protons, perhaps in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 (2H) could be for some protons adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't result in a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one Br is eliminated to form a double bond, and the other undergoes substitution, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination of both HBr leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, in a cyclic structure, the elimination would form a ring with a carbonyl. Let's imagine a scenario where the two adjacent bromines are on a cyclohexane-like ring. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond, but if the ring is such that the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl, perhaps through some kind of ring contraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. Wait, but enol tautomerism would require a conjugated system.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of another approach. The NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, it could be from an -OCH2- group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone or an ester.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like adamantanone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, forms an alcohol. But then why the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone because the reaction is a double elimination, but how?

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But how would that form from a dihalide?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, such as a hydroxyl, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if the next steps can help me figure out what product 1 is.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But what is product 1? If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is formed via some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, and it's treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring to catalyze. So product 1 must have an aromatic ring? But adamantane isn't aromatic.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing some kind of ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, product 1 might be a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Then, treating an epoxide with a Lewis acid could cause it to open in a certain way. But then I'm not sure how that would lead to product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used in some addition reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic compound with a ketone group. Then, product 2 could be formed by some kind of ring-opening or further reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next step, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis acts on alkenes.

So, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Therefore, product 2 must have at least one double bond. So product 1, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, produces an alkene (product 2).

Wait, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. If product 1 is a diol, perhaps the treatment with aluminum isopropoxide then dehydrates it to form an alkene via an E1 or E2 mechanism. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, then product 2 is an alkene. But product 1's IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl, so that would suggest product 1 is a ketone, not a diol.

Hmm, getting a bit stuck again. Let me recap:

- Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (light yellow solid) which has IR at 1720 (carbonyl), and NMR shows 4.79 (2H), and other peaks.

- Step 2: product 1 + excess aluminum isopropoxide â product 2.

- Step 3: product 2 + ozone (then DMS) â product 3.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H has a certain coupling pattern.

Let me think about product 3. Since it's the result of ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, product 3 is likely a carbonyl compound. So whatever the structure of product 2, after ozonolysis, it's broken into fragments with carbonyl groups.

So the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, let's imagine that product 2 is a substituted alkene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 might have carbonyl groups and adjacent groups with hydrogens.

Now, the NMR of product 3 is the focus. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have deshielded protons.

In such a scenario, the coupling pattern would depend on neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it would couple with adjacent protons. Let's consider a structure like RCO-CH2-CH2-..., but wait, ozone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, so if the double bond was in a ring, it might form two carbonyls.

Wait, another example: If product 2 is a tricyclic compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is something like adamantene (adamantane with a double bond). Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two ketones.

Alternatively, product 2 could be an exo-cyclic double bond. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is an alkene nearby. So ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups, perhaps making a diketone or adding carbonyl groups adjacent to the existing ketone.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about the possible structures.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane â treated with KOH â forms a ketone (since IR shows a carbonyl). How?

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an OH via substitution, but that would form a diol. However, the IR doesn't indicate an OH stretch; maybe the OH groups are not present because of the reaction conditions.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane may have bromines at positions that, upon elimination, form a ketone. For example, if the bridge between the two bridgehead carbons breaks, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when both Br atoms are eliminated, a bridge breaks, forming a ketone group. So, for example, if removing two HBr groups leads to a ring contraction and the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Maybe I should think about the NMR of product 1 again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. The other peaks (like 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H) suggest that these are likely the adamantane ring protons, which are typically in the 1.5-2.5 ppm range. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group near an electronegative group.

Putting this together: perhaps product 1 is a ketone where the carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to the adamantane structure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1-adamantyl methyl ketone? Or something similar. So, the structure would be a ketone where the carbonyl is attached to a methyl group, which is part of the adamantane structure.

If that's the case, then product 1's structure would be a ketone, and its NMR would show the methyl ketone's CH3 as a singlet? Wait, no, because 4.79 ppm is for 2H, which doesn't fit a CH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group. So, for example, the carbonyl is part of a CH2CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm^-1, which isn't the case here.

Another angle: Since product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a bicyclic ketone. Then, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid), it could undergo some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is the result of a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane isn't.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a diene, and aluminum isopropoxide induces some cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of ring-opening to form an alkene (product 2). Then, product 2 is an alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, that seems plausible. So, product 1 is a cyclic ketone, product 2 is an alkene formed by ring-opening, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to imagine the possible structures.

Suppose product 1 is a cyclopentenone (a cyclic ketone with a double bond). Then, treatment with a Lewis acid like Al(iPr)3 might cause the ring to open, perhaps via a conjugate addition or some other mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, which upon treatment with Al(iPr)3, loses water to form an alkene (product 2), via an E1 or E2 mechanism. Then, product 2 is an alkene, which undergoes ozonolysis.

That makes sense. So, product 1 would have a structure like a carbonyl adjacent to an -OH group. Then, under acidic conditions (provided by Al(iPr)3), the -OH and adjacent hydrogen would be removed, forming a double bond (product 2). Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. So, if product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl, then product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from an -OCH2- group, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen atom, such as an ether or an alcohol.

Wait, let's imagine product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that's a primary alcohol. But the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an adamantyl ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR shows 4.79 (2H), others, and IR 1720 cm^-1 (carbonyl).

So, product 1 is a ketone. How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Think about vicinal dihalides. Wait, when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent X groups) is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate both X groups to form a carbonyl group. Is that possible?

Yes! I remember that vicinal dihalides can undergo double dehydrohalogenation to form ketones. For example, 2-bromopropane-2-bromide (1,2-dibromopropane) when treated with a strong base (like KOH) would eliminate two HBr molecules to form acetone (propan-2-one).

Ah, that makes sense. So in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated, removing two HBr molecules. The elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons would form a carbonyl group. So product 1 would be a ketone, specifically 1-adamantanone or something similar.

So the structure of product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Its NMR would have the carbonyl as a singlet, not visible in the 1H NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be from a bridgehead proton, but wait, adamantane's bridgehead protons are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 peak is from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but in 1-adamantanone, the carbonyl is at a bridgehead. The adjacent carbons would be part of the adamantane structure.

Wait, but the NMR in product 1 shows 4.79 (2H). Maybe it's not a bridgehead but part of an -OCH2- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has a different structure, like a substituted ketone where the carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, its structure would have the ketone at the bridgehead. The adjacent carbons are all part of the rigid adamantane structure, so the protons on those carbons would be deshielded, but typically in the 1.8-2.5 ppm range. So perhaps the 4.79 ppm peak comes from something else. Maybe it's not part of the adamantane but an impurity or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not 1-adamantanone but a different ketone. Maybe the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide but has bromines on non-adjacent carbons, but in a way that elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the two bromines are on bridgehead carbons that are not directly adjacent but are connected via a bridge. Eliminating both would form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me move to product 2.

Product 1 is a ketone. When treated with aluminum isopropoxide, product 2 is formed. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can facilitate the formation of enolates or promote elimination reactions.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via an elimination reaction. For example, if product 1 has an alpha-hydroxy group, the Lewis acid could dehydrate it to form an alkene.

Wait, but product 1's NMR doesn't show broad peaks that would be indicative of an -OH group. So perhaps product 1 doesn't have an -OH group, but instead is a simple ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is causing some kind of rearrangement. For instance, it could abstract a proton adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an enolate, which then could lose a leaving group. But product 1 is a ketone; perhaps it doesn't have any leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing ring-opening to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is cyclopentanone, the Lewis acid might induce ring-opening to form a diene.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is a mono-cyclic alkene.

Wait, another possibility: The aluminum isopropoxide could facilitate a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but since product 1 is a ketone and not aromatic, that doesn't apply. Maybe it's a different kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with the Lewis acid to form an enol ether, which then undergoes some elimination to form an alkene.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of product 2's structure.

Product 2 is treated with ozone, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have at least one double bond. Thus, product 2 is an alkene.

So, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene. How does a ketone become an alkene with the help of Al(iPr)3?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid causes it to open into an enol, which then loses a proton to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has a leaving group alpha to the carbonyl. For example, if product 1 is a ketone with a bromine alpha to the carbonyl, the Lewis acid could facilitate elimination, forming an alkene. But product 1's structure is based on 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which after elimination becomes a ketone. So perhaps product 1 doesn't have any other leaving groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about product 3. It's the result of ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 is likely a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

Suppose product 3 has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-..., but that's just a guess. The most deshielded H would be on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would couple with the adjacent ones.

Wait, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-X, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say the first CH2) would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the second CH2.

But wait, each H on the first CH2 would also be split by neighboring Hs. Let me think: If the first CH2 is next to a CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But if the adjacent CH2 is split into multiple peaks, that could change the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a CH group next to a carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is an alkene like CH2=CH-..., and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups. The product would then have two carbonyl groups, perhaps with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, another scenario: Suppose product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative. Ozonolysis would break the ring into a diketone. Then, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the adjacent CH2 groups would show up in the NMR.

In that case, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on neighboring groups. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would couple with two Hs on the neighboring group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-

But that's just a linear structure. Each CH2 would couple with the next. The first CH2 (next to the carbonyl) would have two Hs, each coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would be a quartet (n+1, where n=2). But wait, in reality, each H in a CH2 group is equivalent, so the splitting would be a quartet for each, but since they're in a CH2, the splitting might not be observed as such.

Wait, but in reality, for a CH2 next to another CH2, each H would be split by the two adjacent Hs. So each would be a triplet. Wait, no, because each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet, but since they are two Hs in the same group, the splitting would be a quartet. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think of a simple example. Consider CH3CH2OCH2CH2Br. The CH2 next to O would split based on neighboring groups. Alternatively, for ethane: Each CH3 is a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs of the adjacent CH2.

In product 3, the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-...

The first CH2 (next to the carbonyl) would have two Hs. Each H on this CH2 is adjacent to the two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). Thus, the coupling pattern for each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the next group is a CH2 that's not split further, then each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet. However, if that CH2 is next to another group that causes further splitting, the pattern could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group. Then, the coupling would involve more neighbors.

Wait, another possibility: The most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is in a different environment (like being part of a ring), the coupling constants might vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would have each H coupling with the two Hs of the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. However, if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, the pattern might change.

Wait, in the case where the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each H on the middle CH2 would couple with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4, so n+1=5). But that's a pentet, which is option D. But the options don't have that as the first choice; let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm, so if the scenario is a CH2 group between two CH2 groups, each H would be a quintet. But wait, perhaps the structure isn't like that. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH group, leading to a different coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group. For example:

O
||
C-CH2-CH-

In this case, the CH2 would be adjacent to a CH. Each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and the one H on the CH group. Wait, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the CH2 and the one H on the CH, leading to a triplet of triplets (n=2 and n=1, so each coupling multiplies the splitting).

Wait, that would make the coupling pattern a triplet of triplets, which is option B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2. So the H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group, making it a triplet.

Wait, but that would be a triplet, which is option A.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let me recap.

After ozonolysis, product 3 is a carbonyl-containing compound. The most deshielded H is adjacent to the carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring Hs.

If the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2, then each H would be a triplet (coupling with two Hs).

But if the adjacent group is a CH with two Hs, then each H would couple with two Hs on that CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the CH group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but a CH group has only one H, so each H on the CH2 would couple with that one H, leading to a doublet.

Wait, no. If a CH2 is adjacent to a CH, each H on the CH2 would couple with the single H on the CH, leading to a doublet. But if the CH2 is also next to another CH2, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So overall, each H would be a triplet of triplets (coupling with two Hs from one side and one H from the other).

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group that's part of a ring. In that case, the coupling could be more complex.

Another angle: The coupling pattern is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. The most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say this CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to a CH group. Each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and one H from the CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets (each coupling splits the peak into 3, then each of those into 3 again).

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH2 that's itself adjacent to another CH2, the first H would couple with two Hs (making a triplet), and each of those would couple with another two Hs, but that seems like a higher-order splitting which might not be observed as such.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to a CH2 group which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with two Hs (making a triplet) from the adjacent CH2, and perhaps another two from a further CH2, but that would lead to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the scenario is that the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2 group which is then adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, making a triplet. Each of those in the triplet would couple with the two Hs on the next CH2, making each a triplet again, leading to a triplet of triplets (each peak split into 3, each of those split into 3 again, resulting in 9 peaks, but perhaps observed as a triplet of triplets).

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with one H on the CH, making a doublet. Then, if the CH2 is also next to another CH2, each H would also couple with two Hs, making a triplet. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: The most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a methyl group. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the three Hs of the methyl, leading to a quartet (n=3, so n+1=4). But that's a quartet, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the ozonolysis step again. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. If product 2 is a monoene, product 3 would be two carbonyl groups. If it's a diene, product 3 could be a di-ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an exocyclic double bond. For example, a cyclohexane ring with a double bond leading to a side chain. Ozonolysis of an exocyclic double bond would break it into a carbonyl group and a smaller fragment.

In that case, product 3 would have a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to the ring. The CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps coupled with Hs on the ring.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups, producing something like two aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but product 3 would have more than one carbonyl group. The NMR would show Hs adjacent to these groups.

Another approach: Think about the most deshielded H in product 3. It's likely near a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would be determined by the number of neighboring Hs.

If the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, then it's a triplet.

If it's on a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2, then it's a triplet as well (coupling with two Hs).

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say that CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Then each H would be a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, then each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is then adjacent to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs from the first adjacent CH2 and two Hs from the next. But that would lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH group. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH group. Wait, but a CH group only has one H. So each H would couple with one H, making a doublet.

But that doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but we're talking about the most deshielded H, which is likely to be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Putting it all together, I think the most plausible scenario is that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. Hence, each H would be a triplet, making the coupling pattern a triplet. But looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH group and two from the CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: Maybe the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2 group that is itself split into a doublet due to another coupling. This could lead to a triplet of triplets.

But without a clear structural image, it's hard to say. Given the options, I'm leaning towards triplet, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think about another angle. The initial structure after ozonolysis is likely to have a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be option A, triplet.

But wait, another possibility is that the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which has one H. So each H on the CH2 would couple with that single H, leading to a doublet. But that's option not listed, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH2 that is split into a doublet due to another coupling, then each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should try to look for a similar problem or recall a similar reaction.

Wait, I think I remember that when an alkene is ozonolyzed and the resulting ozonide is worked up with DMS, the major products are carbonyl compounds. If the alkene was part of a ring, the ring would break, and the ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

Suppose product 2 is a cycloalkene, say cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, giving adipaldehyde (HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH) or similar, depending on the substituents.

But in our case, product 3 is from ozonolysis of product 2, which was formed from product 1 (a ketone) and aluminum isopropoxide. So perhaps product 2 is a diene or a monoene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple monoene like 1,3-pentadiene, but that's not likely from the given starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an exocyclic double bond, like bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond to form a ketone and an aldehyde.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. 

Let me try to make an educated guess. If product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But another possibility is that it's a triplet of triplets, making option B.

I think I'll go with option A) triplet because that's the simplest scenario.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a product whose NMR coupling pattern is analyzed. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr molecules to form a ketone (product 1). The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, confirming the presence of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a rigid structure, likely 1-adamantanone.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(iPr)â**  
   Product 1 (1-adamantanone) reacts with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) via elimination, as Al(iPr)â can promote dehydration or other elimination reactions. Product 2 is thus an alkene derived from the ketone.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the neighboring groups.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CHâ group is likely adjacent to another CHâ group. Each hydrogen on the CHâ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group, resulting in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
