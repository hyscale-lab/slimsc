Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and what its mean decay distance is. The given values are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay length and see which option matches.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the mean decay distance (or mean decay length) of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (the Lorentz factor), maybe? Or wait, maybe it's the velocity times the lifetime times the speed of light. Let me think.

The mean decay distance L is given by the equation L = βγcτ, where β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light, γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle. But wait, I also recall that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The width Γ is the total decay rate, which is connected to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ, right? Because Γ is the inverse of the lifetime, considering the uncertainty principle.

Wait, but let me get the formulas correctly. Oh yeah, Γ is the decay width, and τ is the mean lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That's correct.

So to find L, I need to compute βγcτ. Let's break it down step by step.

First, compute the velocity β. The particle's energy E is given. For a relativistic particle, the energy E is related to mass m and velocity β by E = γ m c². Wait, yes. So γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²).

So let's compute γ. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV * c²). Wait, but the units will work out because GeV cancels out. But I need to compute this numerically.

Wait, but when I compute γ, the GeV units will cancel because E and m are both in GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

But wait, I should be precise. 8 divided by 1.2 is 8/(6/5) )= (8 *5)/6 = 40/6 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is 6.6667.

Now, β can be calculated from γ. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β:

γ² = 1/(1 - β²)

1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ² → β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Let me compute that. So γ is 6.6667, so 1/γ² is 1/(44.4444) which is approximately 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking square root of 0.9775: let's think. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, because 0.9887 squared is 0.9775. So β ≈ 0.9887.

Now, β is about 0.9887.

Next, we have τ, the proper lifetime. τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me make sure about the units.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. And Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875; so 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. The GeV cancels, so it's (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32.

Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is indeed 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24? Wait, no, 20e-25 is 2e-24. So yes, 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the mean decay length L is βγ c τ.

Wait, so putting it all together:

L = β * γ * c * τ.

We have β ≈ 0.9887, γ ≈ 6.6667, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s, and τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute c * τ: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3*2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24. 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625 → 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by βγ: β is 0.9887, γ is 6.6667. So βγ is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's see. 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.6591, so total is approximately 6.5913.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, 0.9887 * 6.6667:

Let me compute 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.6591. So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913.

So L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, no wait. Wait, the expression is L = (βγ) * (c * τ). Because I think I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, no: L = β * γ * c * τ → same as (β γ) * (c τ). So I can compute (β γ) and then multiply by (c τ).

So β γ is approximately 6.5913.

c τ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Compute that: 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15. 0.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ let's compute 0.5 * 6.1706e-16 = 3.0853e-16. 0.0913 * 6.1706e-16 is approximately 5.635e-17.

So 3.0853e-16 +5.635e-17 ≈ 3.64885e-16.

So total L is approx 3.702375e-15 + 3.64885e-16 = 3.702375e-15 + 0.364885e-15 = 4.06726e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So that's close to option B.

Wait, but let me perhaps do a more precise calculation.

Let me recompute each step accurately.

First, compute γ: γ = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666666667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Compute 1/γ²: (1/6.66666667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.9887.

Wait, but more accurately, sqrt(0.9775) can be calculated. Let me compute it.

We can write 0.9775 is 0.98^2 = 0.9604, 0.988^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604. 0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526. 0.0087 * 0.0087 is 0.00007569.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (a + b)^2, where a=0.98, b=0.0087.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps just accept that β is approximately 0.9887.

So β = 0.9887, γ=6.6667.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → 6.582 ÷ 0.32 → 6.582 * (1/0.32) = 6.582 *3.125 → 6.582 *3 = 19.746, 6.582 *0.125=0.82275 → sum 20.56875.

So τ = 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, c is 2.99792e8 m/s, so let me use a more precise value, perhaps 3e8 m/s is enough for an estimate, but I'll proceed with the precise value.

So c = 2.99792e8 m/s.

Compute c * τ: 2.99792e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Multiply 2.99792e8 by 2.056875e-24.

2.99792 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.170625.

Then 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So cτ ≈ 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L = β γ c τ = β γ * (c τ).

β γ is 0.9887 * 6.66666667 ≈ let's compute that.

0.9887 *6 = 5.9322.

0.9887 *0.66666667 ≈ 0.6591.

So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Now compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

Hmm, 6 *6 is 36, 6 *0.170625 is 1.02375.

0.5913 *6 = 3.5478.

0.5913 * 0.170625 ≈ 0.1008.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

Alternatively, let's compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

6 *6 =36, 6 *0.170625 =1.02375.

0.5913 *6 =3.5478.

0.5913 *0.170625 = approx 0.1008.

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach: 6.5913 *6.170625 = ?

Let me compute 6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.5913 *6.170625 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125, 0.0913 *6.170625≈0.563088.

So 3.0853125 + 0.563088 = 3.6484005.

So total is 37.02375 +3.6484005 = 40.6721505.

So 6.5913 *6.170625 = 40.6721505.

Wait, but wait, that's for 6.5913 *6.170625. So 40.6721505 → which would make L = 40.6721505e-16 m? No, wait, no. Because 6.5913 *6.170625e-16 m = 40.67215e-16 m? No, wait, because 6.170625e-16 is multiplied by 6.5913, so 6.5913 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, wait, no: 6.5913 multiplied by 6.170625e-16 m.

So the product is 6.5913 *6.170625e-16.

So 6.5913 *6.170625 = approximately 40.67215, so 40.67215e-16 m.

Wait, but 40.67215e-16 m is 4.067215e-15 m.

So L ≈4.067215e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So 4.067e-15 is very close to option B. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any calculation errors. Because in my earlier step, I approximated beta as 0.9887, but perhaps a more precise calculation would give a slightly different value. Let me re-calculate beta.

Calculating beta more accurately.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So γ =6.66666666667.

Compute β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

1/γ² = (1/(6.66666666667))².

6.66666666667 is 20/3, so 1/(20/3) = 3/20 = 0.15. So 1/γ² = (3/20)^2 =9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775)=?

Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

I know that sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let me get it more accurately.

We can use the approximation sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x, but x here is 0.0225, which is not that small. Alternatively, perhaps use Newton-Raphson method.

Let me try with x=0.9775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me set y = sqrt(y0), where y0=0.9775.

We can compute y as follows:

We can note that 0.9887^2 = 0.9775?

Wait, let's compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

Compute 0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

Compute 0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

Compute 0.0087 * 0.0087 = 0.00007569.

So it's (a + b)^2 where a=0.98, b=0.0087.

So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a²=0.9604.

2ab=2*(0.98*0.0087)=2*(0.008526)=0.017052.

b²=0.00007569.

Adding them: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452. + 0.00007569 is 0.97752769.

But 0.9775 is what we have. So 0.9775 is less than 0.97752769.

So 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769. Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual sqrt(0.9775) is slightly less than 0.9887.

So let me compute delta.

We have x=0.9775. Let y0=0.9887, y0²=0.97752769.

We can use Newton-Raphson to find a better approximation.

f(y) = y² - x.

f'(y) = 2y.

We want to find y where y² =x=0.9775.

We have y0=0.9887, f(y0)=0.97752769 - 0.9775=0.00002769.

We can compute the next iteration:

y1 = y0 - f(y0)/f'(y0) = 0.9887 - (0.00002769)/(2 * 0.9887) → approx 0.9887 - (0.00002769)/(1.9774) → 0.9887 - ~0.000014 → 0.988686.

So y1≈0.988686.

Compute y1²: (0.988686)^2.

Compute 0.988686 * 0.988686.

Let me compute it:

= (0.988686)^2 ≈ 0.9775 - 0.00002769 + ... Hmm, perhaps better to compute it.

Alternatively, let me compute (0.988686)^2:

= (0.988686) * (0.988686).

Let me compute it step by step.

0.988686 * 0.988686 = ?

It's easier to compute as (0.98 + 0.008686)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008686 + (0.008686)^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008686= 2 * 0.98 * 0.008686 = 1.96 *0.008686 ≈ 0.01700816.

(0.008686)^2 ≈ 0.00007544.

So sum is 0.9604 + 0.01700816 = 0.97740816 + 0.00007544 = 0.9774836.

Wait, but we needed 0.9775, so the actual value of y1 is 0.988686, which gives y1²=0.9774836, which is still less than 0.9775 by about 0.0000164.

So f(y1) = 0.9774836 - 0.9775 = -0.0000164.

So to get a better approximation, Newton-Raphson:

y2 = y1 - f(y1)/(2 y1).

f(y1)=0.9774836 - 0.9775= -0.0000164.

So y2 = 0.988686 - ( (-0.0000164) ) / (2 *0.988686).

Compute denominator: 2 *0.988686 ≈ 1.977372.

So (0.0000164)/1.977372 ≈ 0.00000828.

So y2 = 0.988686 + 0.00000828 ≈ 0.988694.

Compute y2²: 0.988694^2.

Again, using a + b where a=0.98, b=0.008694.

So a²=0.9604.

2ab= 2*0.98 *0.008694= 1.96 *0.008694 ≈ 0.01702224.

b²= (0.008694)^2 ≈ 0.00007559.

Sum: 0.9604 +0.01702224=0.97742224 +0.00007559≈0.97749783.

Which is still under 0.9775 by 0.00000217.

So f(y2)=0.97749783 -0.9775= -0.00000217.

So f(y2)= -0.00000217.

Compute y3 = y2 - (f(y2))/(2 y2).

f(y2)= -0.00000217.

y3= y2 - (-0.00000217)/(2*y2)

= y2 + (0.00000217)/(2 y2)

y2=0.988694 → 2*y2≈1.977388.

0.00000217 / 1.977388 ≈ 1.1e-6.

So y3≈0.988694 + 0.0000011= 0.9886951.

Now, compute y3²= (0.9886951)^2.

Again, perhaps approximate it using a=0.98, b=0.0086951.

a²=0.9604.

2ab=2*0.98*0.0086951= 1.96 *0.0086951≈ 0.01703009.

b²= (0.0086951)^2≈ 0.0000756.

Sum: 0.9604 + 0.01703009 = 0.97743009 + 0.0000756 ≈0.97750569.

Which is just over 0.9775 by 0.00000569.

So f(y3)=0.97750569 -0.9775=0.00000569.

So now, using Newton-Raphson again:

y4 = y3 - f(y3)/(2y3).

f(y3)=0.00000569.

2 y3=2*0.9886951≈1.9773902.

So delta = 0.00000569 / 1.9773902≈0.000002875.

y4 =0.9886951 - 0.000002875=0.988692225.

So y4≈0.988692225.

Compute y4²: 0.988692225^2.

Again, using a=0.98, b=0.008692225.

a²=0.9604.

2ab=2*0.98 *0.008692225=1.96 *0.008692225≈0.0170275.

b²= (0.008692225)^2≈0.00007556.

Sum: 0.9604 +0.0170275=0.9774275 +0.00007556≈0.97750306.

Which is 0.97750306, which is just above 0.9775 by 0.00000306.

Hmm, it's oscillating around the correct value. But maybe for our purposes, beta is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that beta is approximately 0.9887, as the slight variations in beta won't significantly affect the calculation.

So, proceeding with β =0.9887 and gamma=6.6666667.

Now, computing β gamma: 0.9887 *6.6666667.

Let me compute this precisely.

6.6666667 * 0.9887 = ?

6 *0.9887=5.9322.

0.6666667 *0.9887=0.6591333.

So sum is 5.9322 +0.6591333=6.5913333.

So β gamma≈6.5913333.

Now, c τ is 2.99792e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this precisely.

2.99792e8 = 299792000 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s.

So 299792000 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

299792000 ≈3e8, but let's compute exactly:

299792000 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.99792e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.99792 *2.056875 = ?

Compute 2 *2.056875=4.11375.

0.99792 *2.056875.

Compute 1 *2.056875=2.056875.

Subtract 0.00208 *2.056875≈0.004273.

So 2.056875 - 0.004273 ≈2.0526.

So total: 4.11375 + 2.0526=6.16635.

So 2.99792 *2.056875 ≈6.16635.

Now, multiply by 1e8 * 1e-24 =1e-16.

So cτ=6.16635e-16 m.

Now, L=βγ * cτ=6.5913333 *6.16635e-16 m.

Compute 6.5913333 *6.16635.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.16635=0.9981.

0.5913333 *6=3.548.

0.5913333 *0.16635≈0.5913333 *0.16635 ≈0.09826.

Add them up:36 +0.9981=36.9981; 3.548 +0.09826≈3.64626.

Total≈36.9981 +3.64626=40.64436.

So 6.5913333 *6.16635≈40.64436.

So L=40.64436e-16 m=4.064436e-15 m.

So approximately 4.0644e-15 meters.

Now, look at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So our computed value is about 4.0644e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15).

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 2.99792 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) are given as \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relativistic energy relation:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( c \tau \)
The product \( c \tau \) is:

\[
c \tau = (2.99792 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = (0.9887) \times (6.6667) \approx 6.5913
\]

### Step 6: Compute \( L \)
Finally, the mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau = (6.5913) \times (6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}) = 4.0644 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 7: Compare with options
The computed value \( L \approx 4.0644 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
