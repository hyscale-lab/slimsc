Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of it. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. Let me think about what factors influence the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature changes. But wait, are the spots causing localized cooling, or is the overall Teff a weighted average? Hmm, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the Teff is lower, but I guess the spots themselves are cooler regions. So the star's surface isn't isothermal anymore, but the overall measured Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem says to assume LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) in the photosphere. So each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE, but the overall emitted flux is a mix. Oh wait, but the question is about the ratio in each part—no, wait the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So maybe the question is considering the average over the entire photosphere. Or perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) contributes to the observed spectrum.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the overall photosphere's average T is lower. But wait, the star's surface isn't uniform anymore. So maybe the problem is treating the photosphere as being at a lower effective T when spots are present.

Wait, but wait. The effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux. If 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), the total flux is lower, so the effective temperature (which is a measure of the total flux) goes down. But the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. So when the star has spots, the overall photosphere's effective T is 5500 K. But wait, the photospheric conditions might be a mix of regions with different temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says to assume LTE in the photosphere. So perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. The spots might be at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the unspotted regions at T_unspotted.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K.

So perhaps the Teff is the average of the two regions, weighted by their area.

Let me think. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that flux is proportional to T^4. So the total flux from the star is the sum of flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.

Let F_total be the total flux, F_spot and F_unspot the flux from each area.

So F_total = F_unspot * 0.6 + F_spot * 0.4.

But F_unspot is sigma * T_unspot^4 * (area_unspot / total_area), but since we're considering fractional areas, F_unspot = 0.6 * sigma * T_unspot^4.

Similarly, F_spot = 0.4 * sigma * T_spot^4.

Then F_total = sigma * (0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4).

The effective temperature is defined such that F_total = sigma Teff^4.

So Teff^4 = 0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4.

But when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. So T_unspot must be 6000 K when no spots are present.

Wait, no. When there are no spots, T_unspot is 6000 K, and all the surface is emitting at that T.

When 40% is covered by spots, the effective T drops to 5500 K. So 5500^4 = 0.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Wait, no, because when 40% of the surface is spots, the non-spots are at 6000 K, and spots at some lower temperature T_spot.

So let's compute T_spot.

Let me compute:

Teff^4 = 0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

We have Teff = 5500 K.

So compute 5500^4 = 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*T_spot^4.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute (6000)^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

(5500)^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5=30.25; 30.25*5.5=166.375; 166.375*5.5=915.0625. So 915.0625e12.

So:

915.0625e12 = 0.6 * 1296e12 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Compute 0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12.

So 915.0625e12 = 777.6e12 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Subtract 777.6e12 from both sides:

915.0625e12 -777.6e12 = 0.4*T_spot^4.

137.4625e12 = 0.4 * T_spot^4.

So T_spot^4 = 137.4625e12 / 0.4 = 343.65625e12.

Taking the fourth root:

T_spot = (343.65625e12)^(1/4).

Wait, 343.65625e12 is 3.4365625e14.

So the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Let me compute log10(3.4365625e14) = log10(3.4365625) + 14 ≈ 0.536 +14=14.536.

Divide by 4: 14.536/4 = 3.634. So 10^3.634 ≈ 4280 K.

Wait, wait, because 10^3.634 is 10^3 is 1000, 10^0.634 is about 4.28, so 1000 *4.28 = 4280.

So T_spot ≈ 4280 K.

Hmm. So when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is at ~4280 K, and 60% is at 6000 K.

But the problem says that the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) in the photosphere decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, but the ratio depends on the temperature. Let me think. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that the energy levels are such that E2 > E1 (since level 2 is higher), then exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would be a decreasing function of T. So as T increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases. Because higher T makes the exponential less negative, so the ratio goes up.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the spots are present, the overall ratio is lower than when they're not present.

Wait, but the way the star's surface is mixed, perhaps we have to take into account the average ratio across the entire photosphere. Because some regions are hotter (6000 K) and others are cooler (4280 K). So the observed ratio would be a sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their area.

But wait, the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE. So each region emits according to its own temperature. So to find the overall ratio, we'd have to look at each region's contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's average T is lower, and so the average ratio of Ti levels is lower. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But the ratio in each region is determined by their local T. So to find the overall ratio, perhaps we need to calculate a flux-weighted average or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) has its own ratio, which we then combine according to their area or emission.

Wait, but the number of atoms in each energy level across the photosphere would be the sum of each region's contribution. So the total number of atoms in level 1 is the sum of those in each region, and same for level 2.

So, the overall ratio would be (n2_total)/(n1_total) = [sum (n2_i * A_i)] / [sum (n1_i * A_i)], where A_i is the area or the fraction of the surface for each region.

Alternatively, since it's a ratio, perhaps it's the flux-weighted average, considering that hotter regions emit more flux.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let's think carefully.

Each region (spot and non-spot) has a certain area fraction (0.4 and 0.6 respectively), and each has its own temperature (T_spot and T_unspot). Each region will have a certain number density of Ti atoms in each energy level.

The total number of Ti atoms in level 1 (n1_total) would be the sum of the contributions from each region multiplied by their area. Similarly for level 2 (n2_total).

So, the ratio R = n2_total / n1_total = [ (n2_unspot * 0.6) + (n2_spot * 0.4) ] / [ (n1_unspot * 0.6) + (n1_spot * 0.4) ]

But n2_unspot / n1_unspot = R_unspot = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspot) )

Similarly, R_spot = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) )

Assuming that g2/g1 is the same for both regions, as it's a property of the atom.

So let me define R(T) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Then, R_unspot = R(T_unspot) and R_spot = R(T_spot).

So R_total = [ R_unspot * 0.6 + R_spot * 0.4 ] / [ 0.6 + 0.4 * (R_spot/R_unspot) ) ]

Wait, no, because n2 = R * n1.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it as:

n1_total = 0.6 * n1_unspot + 0.4 * n1_spot.

n2_total = 0.6 * n2_unspot + 0.4 * n2_spot.

But n2_unspot = R_unspot * n1_unspot.

n2_spot = R_spot * n1_spot.

So,

n2_total = 0.6 R_unspot n1_unspot + 0.4 R_spot n1_spot.

n1_total = 0.6 n1_unspot + 0.4 n1_spot.

So R_total = [0.6 R_unspot n1_unspot + 0.4 R_spot n1_spot ] / [0.6 n1_unspot + 0.4 n1_spot ]

But n1_unspot and n1_spot are the number densities in each level 1 in their respective regions.

Wait, but also, the number density of Ti atoms, regardless of the level, should be the same in each region. Because the total number of atoms per unit volume is fixed. So the sum of n1 + n2 + ... (all levels) is the same for each region. But since we're only considering two levels, perhaps n1_unspot + n2_unspot = n1_spot + n2_spot = n_Ti.

Hmm, but wait, in the Boltzmann equation, it's about the ratio within each region. So perhaps n1_unspot and n1_spot are the same as the same element, but the ratio depends on temperature.

Wait, maybe I can express n1 and n2 in terms of the partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps each region contributes a certain ratio, and the average is a flux-weighted average. Wait, because the emission from each region depends on their temperature, which affects the flux. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere. So it's about the actual number of atoms in each level across the entire photosphere.

So, perhaps the total number of Ti atoms in level 2 is the sum of the Ti in level 2 from both regions, and same for level 1.

But let me think in terms of per unit area.

Let’s say the total area is A. The unspotted area is 0.6 A, and spotted is 0.4 A.

In the unspotted area, the number of Ti atoms per unit area in level 1 is n1_unspot, and in level 2 is n2_unspot = R_unspot * n1_unspot.

Similarly, in the spotted area, n1_spot, n2_spot = R_spot * n1_spot.

So the total n1_total = 0.6 A * n1_unspot + 0.4 A * n1_spot.

Similarly, n2_total = 0.6 A * R_unspot n1_unspot + 0.4 A * R_spot n1_spot.

The ratio R_total = n2_total / n1_total.

Now, the ratio R_unspot = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_unspot)).

Similarly, R_spot = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spot)).

So, let me express R_unspot as R_u and R_spot as R_s.

Then, R_total = [0.6 R_u n1_unspot + 0.4 R_s n1_spot ] / [0.6 n1_unspot + 0.4 n1_spot ]

But n1_unspot and n1_spot are the number densities in level 1 for each region. The total number density of Ti in each region is n_Ti = n1 + n2 = n1 + R * n1 = n1 (1 + R) → n1 = n_Ti / (1 + R).

Wait, but for each region, n1 = (n_Ti) / (1 + R_region), where R_region is R_u or R_s.

So, for unspotted region: n1_unspot = n_Ti_u / (1 + R_u).

Similarly, in spotted region: n1_spot = n_Ti_s / (1 + R_s).

But is n_Ti_u the same as n_Ti_s? Well, that depends on whether the number of Ti atoms per unit area is the same in both regions. I think since the spots are just cooler regions, the overall abundance of Ti might be the same across the surface. So n_Ti_u = n_Ti_s = n_Ti.

Assuming that, n1_unspot = n_Ti / (1 + R_u), and n1_spot = n_Ti / (1 + R_s).

Substituting back into R_total:

R_total = [ 0.6 R_u (n_Ti/(1 + R_u)) + 0.4 R_s (n_Ti/(1 + R_s)) ] / [ 0.6 (n_Ti/(1 + R_u)) + 0.4 (n_Ti/(1 + R_s)) ]

The n_Ti cancels out since it's a common factor in numerator and denominator.

So,

R_total = [ 0.6 R_u/(1+R_u) + 0.4 R_s/(1+R_s) ] / [ 0.6/(1+R_u) + 0.4/(1+R_s) ]

Hmm, that seems manageable.

So, let's compute R_u and R_s.

Given that the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which corresponds to the energy difference ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, the energy difference between the two levels isn't directly given, but the wavelength is. So we can compute ΔE from the wavelength.

But wait, since the problem gives the wavelength, we can compute the energy difference using the relation E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m)
= 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, but this is the energy per photon. Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the difference in energy between the two levels. So for each transition, that's the ΔE.

But we can also compute the value in terms of k*T, which is in eV as well.

So for each temperature T (unspot and spot), we can compute k*T in eV, and then compute the exponent.

Let me compute k*T for T_unspot=6000 K and T_spot=4280 K.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

k*T_unspot = 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

k*T_spot = 8.617e-5 * 4280 ≈ 0.369 eV.

So,

For R_u (unspotted region):

R_u = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspot) )

ΔE is 8.56 eV.

So,

exp( -8.56 / 0.517 ) = exp( -16.55 ) ≈ 8.2e-8.

Wait, that's a very small number. So R_u is (g2/g1) multiplied by 8.2e-8.

Similarly, for R_s:

exp( -8.56 / 0.369 ) ≈ exp( -23.18 ) ≈ 7.5e-11.

So R_s is (g2/g1) multiplied by 7.5e-11.

Hmm, but given that both exponents are negative and very large in magnitude, R_u and R_s are very small.

So R_u = (g2/g1) * 8.2e-8.

R_s = (g2/g1) * 7.5e-11.

Assuming that (g2/g1) is a constant, let's call it G. So R_u = G * 8.2e-8, R_s = G *7.5e-11.

Now, let's plug these into R_total.

Compute numerator: 0.6 R_u/(1 + R_u) + 0.4 R_s/(1 + R_s )

Denominator: 0.6/(1 + R_u) + 0.4/(1 + R_s )

But R_u is very small (8.2e-8), so 1 + R_u ≈ 1.

Similarly, R_s is even smaller (7.5e-11), so 1 + R_s ≈ 1.

So, approximately, numerator ≈ 0.6 R_u + 0.4 R_s.

Denominator ≈ 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.

So R_total ≈ 0.6 R_u + 0.4 R_s.

Which is (0.6 R_u + 0.4 R_s) ≈ R_u (0.6) + R_s (0.4).

So,

R_total ≈ (0.6 * 8.2e-8 * G) + (0.4 * 7.5e-11 * G )

= G [ 0.6 *8.2e-8 + 0.4 *7.5e-11 ]

Compute each term:

0.6 *8.2e-8 = 4.92e-8.

0.4 *7.5e-11 = 3e-11.

So total is 4.92e-8 + 3e-11 ≈ 4.923e-8.

So R_total ≈ G * 4.923e-8.

Now, the ratio when the star does not have spots is when T_eff is 6000 K, so all regions are at 6000 K. So in that case, the entire photosphere has R = R_u.

So the ratio when there are no spots (R_no_spots) is R_u = G *8.2e-8.

The ratio when there are spots (R_spots) is R_total ≈ 4.923e-8 G.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is:

Factor = R_no_spots / R_spots = (8.2e-8 G) / (4.923e-8 G) ) = 8.2 /4.923 ≈ 1.666.

Wait, but that's approximately 1.666. But looking at the options, the closest one is A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, none of the options are close to 1.666. Hmm, perhaps my assumption that R_u and R_s are so small is making the approximation too crude.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe the problem is assuming that the overall photospheric temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they're not. So the ratio is simply determined by the Boltzmann factor at each temperature, and the factor is (R_no_spots) / (R_spots) = exp(ΔE/(k T_no_spots)) / exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)).

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when the star has no spots, T_eff = 6000 K. So R_no_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) )

When the star has spots, T_eff = 5500 K. So R_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) )

The ratio of R_no_spots to R_spots would be:

(R_no_spots / R_spots ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T_spots) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )

Let me compute that.

ΔE is 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 99308 K.

Now,

1/T_spots = 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/T_no_spots = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

So,

ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] = 99308 [ (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 -1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3.3e7) )= 500/(33000000) )= 1.515e-5.

So,

99308 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99308 * 1.515e-5 ≈ approximately 1.505.

So,

exp(1.505) ≈ 4.5.

Because exp(1.6) is about 4.953, and 1.505 is just under that, maybe around 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio when there are no spots is about 4.5 times larger than when there are spots.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference (\( \Delta E \))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( kT \) for both temperatures
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). For \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
kT_{\text{no spots}} = (8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000) \approx 0.517 \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
kT_{\text{spots}} = (8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500) \approx 0.474 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio of \( n_2/n_1 \) for both cases
The ratio of \( n_2/n_1 \) depends on \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \). For \( T_{\text{no spots}} \):

\[
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{8.56}{0.517}\right).
\]

For \( T_{\text{spots}} \):

\[
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{8.56}{0.474}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E/k = 8.56 / 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \approx 99308 \, \text{K} \), and \( 1/T_{\text{spots}} - 1/T_{\text{no spots}} = (1/5500 - 1/6000) \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1} \):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99308 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) \approx \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
