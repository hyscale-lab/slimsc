Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Hmm, wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, I think that's a typo. Benzene rings are numbered with the substituents in the order they appear. So 1-bromo-2-d? Wait, no, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene or something else. Oh wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene? No, wait, the way the formula is written, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Alternatively, the 'd' could be a typo for another substituent. Hmm, maybe the correct name is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Alternatively, perhaps 'd' stands for something else, like a dimethyl group or another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the structure. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d: the main ring has a bromine at position 1, and another substituent at position 2. What is that substituent? Oh, maybe it's a methyl group, but the 'd' might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, which would have Cl at positions 2 and maybe another position. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' is part of another substituent, like a di-substituent.

Wait, maybe I should proceed regardless. The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, typically used for elimination reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Oh wait, wait! NaNH2 in ammonia is a dehydrohalogenation agent. Alternatively, it's used for dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, wait: in the context of aromatic rings, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation of a benzyl halide to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a bromide with a strong base, like NaNH2. This could lead to elimination. But wait, in an aromatic ring, perhaps it's a ring expansion or contraction, but that's less common. Alternatively, if the bromide is on a benzyl position, perhaps it's a benzyl bromide, and the base could abstract a proton adjacent to the bromide, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the structure. Maybe the molecule is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromobenzene with a methyl group at position 2. Oh, wait, but the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' is a typo for 'methyl' or another substituent. Let me assume that the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

So, the structure is bromobenzene with a methyl group at the ortho position. Now, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, what happens?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. In such conditions, perhaps the methyl group is deprotonated, but wait, methyl groups are not easily deprotonated. Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. For that, the base would abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, and the bromide leaves, forming a double bond.

But wait, the bromine is attached to a benzene ring. So, the benzyl bromide has Br attached to a benzene ring, and there's a methyl group in the ortho position.

Wait, benzyl bromide is when the Br is attached to a CH2 group attached to the benzene. But in this case, the Br is directly attached to the benzene ring, right? So it's bromobenzene, but with another substituent.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in benzyl bromide, the structure is benzene-CH2-Br. But in bromobenzene, it's benzene-Br. So in this case, the starting molecule is 1-bromo-2-something benzene. So, the Br is attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent is at position 2.

Wait, then the molecule would be like a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and another group at position 2. Maybe that's a methyl group, so 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

So, when treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group. Wait, but methyl groups are poor leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction. But elimination usually requires a good leaving group adjacent to a hydrogen that can be abstracted. So, in this case, maybe the Br is adjacent to a CH2 group; but wait, in bromobenzene, the Br is directly attached to the ring, so there's no adjacent CH2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Another possibility is that NaNH2 in ammonia is used for dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system; forming a double bond in the ring would require breaking some existing bonds, which isn't likely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated, usually with electron-withdrawing groups. But in our case, the substituents are a Br (which is an EWG) and maybe a methyl (which is an EDG). So, perhaps the ring is activated in some positions and deactivated in others.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's abstracting a proton next to the Br, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge or something. Wait, perhaps it's an aromatic elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility of multiple elimination products. For example, if the Br is at position 1 and the substituent at position 2 allows for elimination in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, let me think again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, and we're treating it with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to a benzyl carbanion. But wait, the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring, so deprotonation would give a benzyl anion. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, leading to a double bond between the carbon where the methyl was and the ring.

Wait, but wait. If the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the methyl is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, which is adjacent to the ring, then that would form a carbanion, and then the Br could leave as Br-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to draw the structure mentally. Benzene ring, with Br at position 1. The methyl group is at position 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the structure is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: CH3
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

Deprotonating the methyl group would give a CH2- group. Then, the Br would leave, forming a double bond between the benzene ring and the CH2. But wait, that would form a benzylidene structure.

Wait, perhaps the elimination would form a double bond between the ring and the carbon where the methyl was, leading to a structure where the ring has a double bond to the adjacent carbon. So, the product would be styrene or something like that. Wait, but styrene is benzene with a vinyl group. So, the product would be benzene with a CH2=CH2 group? No, wait, the elimination would form a double bond between the benzene carbon and the former CH3 carbon.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a substituted benzene with a double bond attached. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, we could form a benzene ring with a double bond in the side chain. So, the Br is replaced by a double bond.

Wait, let me imagine this: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Upon treatment with a strong base, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen (in this case, the hydrogen adjacent to the Br, but wait, Br is attached to the ring, not a chain).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the starting material is a benzyl bromide, where Br is attached to a CH2 group attached to benzene. For example, benzyl bromide is Ph-CH2-Br. In that case, treatment with NaNH2 could lead to elimination, forming Ph-CH2-Br → Ph-CH2^- + Br^- → perhaps elimination to form Ph-CH2 and HBr? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, elimination would form Ph-CH2-Br → Ph-CH2^- and then, upon losing Br, the structure would become Ph-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the reaction mechanism. NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In a benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br), the base could deprotonate the adjacent hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond via an E2 mechanism. So, PhCH2Br + NaNH2 → PhCH=CH2 + NH3 + HBr. But wait, that's not quite correct. Alternatively, the product would be Ph-CH2-Br → Ph-CH2^- + Br^-; but that doesn't directly lead to a double bond without a β hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps we're getting into a discussion about the mechanism. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, then the Br is attached directly to the ring, not to a CH2 group. So, perhaps elimination isn't feasible because there's no β hydrogen adjacent to the Br. Then, what's the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves substitution. But for aromatic substitution, usually a ring activation is needed. Bromobenzene is not very reactive towards substitution without a strong activating group. However, in this case, perhaps the substituent is ortho and para directing.

Wait, maybe the base is deprotonating a position on the ring. Let me think: if the ring has Br and a methyl group, the base might abstract a proton from the ring in a position where it's activated. For example, the methyl group is an activating group (ortho/para directing), so the base could abstract a proton from the ortho or para position relative to the methyl group.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So, perhaps it's abstracting a proton from the ring, leading to a benzene anion. But that's usually very unstable unless resonance is possible. However, in the presence of a substituent like methyl, which is activating, maybe the ring can stabilize the negative charge via resonance.

Wait, but benzene anions are very unstable. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. In such reactions, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. In this case, bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but in the ortho position, perhaps it's activating for certain positions.

Wait, but NaNH2 is providing the NH2^- ion as a nucleophile. For nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards attack by a nucleophile, which usually isn't the case for bromobenzene because it's deactivated. However, if the ring has activating groups in the right positions, perhaps substitution can occur.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of similar reactions. For example, when a benzyl halide (like benzyl bromide) is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the base abstracts a β hydrogen, leading to elimination and the formation of a double bond. So, benzyl bromide would form styrene (vinyl benzene). But in our case, the structure is different.

Wait, so if the starting molecule is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the structure is more like:

Benzene ring with Br at position 1 and CH3 at position 2.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH3 group, but wait, the CH3 is attached to the ring, so the hydrogen is on the CH3. If we abstract a hydrogen from the CH3 (which has three hydrogens), then perhaps the base would abstract a hydrogen, leading to a carbanion.

Wait, but the CH3 group is attached to the ring, so the hydrogen is on the methyl carbon. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, that would lead to a benzene ring with a CH2- group (since one H is removed). Then, what happens next? Maybe the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, but let me think about this. The structure is:

Benzene ring:
1: Br
2: CH3

After deprotonation at position 2, the CH3 becomes CH2^-, and then Br leaves, yielding a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and a CH2 group attached to position 2.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again. Maybe the elimination would form a double bond between the ring carbon where Br was and the adjacent carbon. But wait, if the Br is at position 1 and the methyl is at position 2, then the adjacent carbons are 1 and 2. So, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but C1 is attached to Br. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position meta or para to the Br, leading to a ring expansion or another process. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds through a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the base acts as a nucleophile, but that would require the ring to be activated. But in 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the presence of the methyl group (an activating group) could activate certain positions for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but aromatic nucleophilic substitution typically requires a ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, to activate the ring. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but it's meta-directing. However, in the presence of a methyl group (ortho/para directing, activating), perhaps the ring could undergo substitution in certain positions.

But wait, the methyl group is at position 2. So, the positions ortho to the methyl are positions 1 and 3. But position 1 already has the Br. So, maybe the ring could undergo substitution at position 3 or another position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, like benzaldehyde or something else. Wait, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could involve two elimination steps, leading to different products. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking, and the main product is just one. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of possible products. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to different positions of elimination, then the answer might be C)2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Then, the structure would be:

Positions 1: Br
2: Cl
4: Cl

In this case, treating with NaNH2 could lead to elimination of HCl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo elimination in different ways, leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, and the base replaces the Br with an NH2 group. But that would require the ring to be activated, which it isn't in this case.

Wait, but bromobenzene is not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. However, in the presence of a strong activating group, perhaps substitution could occur. For example, if the methyl group is present in the ortho position, maybe the ring is activated enough for substitution at position 1 (where Br is) to occur with the NH2^- nucleophile.

Wait, but substitution at position 1 would require that position to be activated. The methyl group is at position 2, which is ortho to position 1. So, the methyl group is an activating group, which would activate position 1 for substitution. But wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group. So, perhaps the ring is undergoing a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced by NH2.

Wait, if that's the case, then the product would be 1-amino-2-methylbenzene, or aniline derivative. But I'm not sure if the reaction conditions favor that. NaNH2 is a strong base, but can it also act as a nucleophile in this context?

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is being displaced by the amide ion (NH2^-), leading to substitution. But in that case, the product would be aniline, but with the substituents.

But wait, in aromatic substitution, such as in the case of bromobenzene, substitution reactions are usually difficult without a strong activating group. However, in this case, the presence of the methyl group in the ortho position could activate the ring for substitution at position 1.

Wait, but wait: the methyl group is an activating group, which directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. But in this case, we're looking at nucleophilic substitution, so perhaps the situation is different. I'm a bit confused about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in the side chain. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, elimination would form a benzene ring with a CH2 group attached, which would have a double bond between the ring and the adjacent carbon. So, the product would be styrene (vinylbenzene).

But wait, styrene has the structure Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styrene is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Styrene is benzene with a vinyl group (CH2=CH2) attached. Wait, no, styrene is benzene with a CH2=CH2 group, but that's not right. Wait, styrene is C6H5-CH=CH2. No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of styrene is benzene with a vinyl group attached. So, it's Ph-CH2-CH2? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, styrene is benzene with a vinyl group, so it's Ph-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as Ph-CH2-CH2, but that can't be. Wait, no, styrene is actually C6H5-CH=CH2. So, the benzene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to another CH2.

Wait, no, the structure of styrene is benzene ring attached to a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH2, but that's not correct. Wait, no, vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So styrene is benzene with a CH2=CH2 group? No, that's not correct. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct myself: the structure of styrene is benzene with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached. So, it's C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Actually, styrene is C6H5-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond would be between the two CH2 groups, but that's not correct. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: vinyl is CH2=CH-, so styrene would be benzene with a CH2=CH2 group attached. But that doesn't make sense structurally. Oh wait, perhaps it's benzene with a CH2-CH2 group where one of the CH2's is double-bonded. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me get back to the reaction. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to a carbanion, then the Br leaves, forming a double bond between the ring and the adjacent carbon. So, the product would be benzene with a CH2 group attached, which is then double-bonded, leading to a structure like Ph-CH2-CH2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a benzene ring with an adjacent double bond, like a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 1.

Wait, but how would that look? Position 1 is where the Br was. So, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group at position 1. So, the structure would be C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps it's C6H4-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in the ring itself. But that's not possible because benzene is already aromatic with three double bonds.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the reaction could result in the loss of HBr, forming a new double bond adjacent to the ring. So, the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent position (say, position 2) has a CH3 group. Deprotonation of the CH3 could lead to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between position 1 and 2. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it a diene? But wait, that would disrupt the aromaticity of benzene. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a double bond but instead forms a benzene ring with a substituent that results in different isomers. For example, if elimination leads to a substituent that can be in different positions, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of the possible products again. If elimination occurs, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, like a benzene ring with a CH2 group that has a double bond. So, the product would be a substituted styrene.

But then, how many possible products can form? If the substituent can be in different positions, perhaps leading to multiple products.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of different regioisomers. For example, if the double bond forms between C1 and C2, or C1 and another position.

Wait, but in 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the Br is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 2. If elimination occurs between position 1 and 2, then the product would have a double bond between those two. But that would make the ring non-aromatic, which isn't possible. So, perhaps elimination isn't feasible in this structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but via substitution, leading to substitution at position 1 (Br) with NH2, forming 1-amino-2-methylbenzene. But would that be the only product?

Wait, if substitution occurs, then the product would be aniline derivative. But if there are multiple possible positions for substitution, then multiple products would form. But in this case, substitution is at position 1, which is where the Br is. So, the product would be a single compound: 1-amino-2-methylbenzene.

But wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if substitution occurs, and only one product is formed, then the answer would be B)1.

But earlier, I thought elimination could lead to multiple products, but perhaps elimination isn't possible here.

Alternatively, perhaps both substitution and elimination occur, leading to more than one product.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. Substitution reactions typically require different conditions, such as a Lewis acid catalyst, whereas elimination is favored by strong bases.

So, perhaps elimination is the main pathway here. But earlier, I thought elimination leads to a product with a double bond, but perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the base abstracting a hydrogen from the ring. For example, the methyl group at position 2 is an activating group, so the ring could be deprotonated at positions ortho and para to the methyl group. That would lead to formation of a benzene anion with negative charge at those positions.

But then, what would happen with the Br? Maybe the Br leaves, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to a ring expansion or some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, leading to a benzene anion, which could then lose Br- as a leaving group, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible products again.

If the reaction is substitution, then the product is 1-amino-2-methylbenzene (only one product).

If the reaction is elimination, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group. But how many such products are possible?

Wait, perhaps elimination leads to a single product. So, the total number of products would be one or two.

Wait, but in some cases, the reaction could lead to multiple regioisomers. For example, if the substituent can form a double bond in different positions.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 2. So, if elimination occurs between position 1 and 2, that would form a double bond between those positions, but that's adjacent to the ring, which isn't possible as it would disrupt aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no products form, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms benzene with a substituent that is a double bond, leading to a single product.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another angle. The question is about how many possible organic products are formed. Options are 1,2,3,4.

If the reaction leads to substitution, only one product. If elimination leads to one product, same thing. If elimination leads to multiple products, then more than one.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product due to different substitution or elimination pathways.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the base abstracting a hydrogen from the ring leading to different positions of substitution.

Wait, but the starting material has a Br and a methyl group. The methyl group is an activating group, so the ring could be deprotonated at positions ortho and para to the methyl group. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either position 3 or position 6 (assuming the methyl is at position 2). Then, if the Br leaves, perhaps forming a new substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, which could form in different positions, leading to multiple products.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the possibility of multiple E2 eliminations leading to different products. If the base can abstract hydrogen from different positions adjacent to the Br, leading to different elimination products.

But in this case, the Br is directly attached to the ring, so there's no adjacent CH2 group. So, perhaps elimination isn't possible, and substitution is the main pathway, leading to only one product.

So, in that case, the number of products would be 1, which is option B.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible, and substitution is the only pathway, leading to one product.

So, after all that, I think the correct answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The compound 1-bromobenzene-2-d is interpreted as 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, where the bromine is directly attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and a methyl group is attached at position 2. The reaction conditions with NaNH₂, a strong base, suggest a possible elimination or substitution reaction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   NaNH₂ can act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. However, aromatic substitution typically requires the ring to be activated by electron-donating groups. The methyl group at position 2 is an activating group, which could facilitate substitution at position 1 (where bromine is attached). This would yield 1-amino-2-methylbenzene as the product. Substitution at position 1 is the most plausible pathway under these conditions.

2. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   Elimination reactions usually require a β-hydrogen adjacent to the leaving group (bromine). However, in this case, bromine is directly attached to the benzene ring, and there is no β-hydrogen available for elimination. Thus, elimination is not feasible.

3. **Regioselectivity and Products**:  
   Since elimination is not possible, the reaction proceeds via substitution. The methyl group at position 2 directs the substitution to occur at position 1 (ortho to the methyl group). This results in a single product, 1-amino-2-methylbenzene.

### Conclusion:
The reaction leads to a single organic product, 1-amino-2-methylbenzene, as substitution is the only viable pathway under the given conditions.

Answer: B
