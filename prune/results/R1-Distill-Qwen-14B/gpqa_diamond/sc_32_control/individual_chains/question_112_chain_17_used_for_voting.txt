Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that we have an electron in a state |α⟩ which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, so I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So the first thing is to normalize this state because the question says it's "proportional" to that combination. Right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized so that their probabilities add up to 1.

Wait, so the state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but it's only proportional. So I need to find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is ⟨α|α⟩ = 1. Let's compute that. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let's calculate each magnitude squared. For (1+i), the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared it's 2. For (2 - i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5), squared is 5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Alright, now the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that look like? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the operator is 2x2, so the indices i and j can be 1 and 2 (assuming |up> is 1 and |down> is 2, or vice versa).

So the matrix elements are A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0. Let me write that out:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Oh wait, I think this is the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying that by ħ/2 would give exactly this A.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. Since Pauli X has eigenvalues ±1, and the eigenstates are the same as those for the X operator.

Wait, more precisely, the eigenvalues for A are (since A = (ħ/2) X), so the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenstates of X are the states |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |up⟩ and |down⟩.

Wait, the eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So I should express |α⟩ in terms of these |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ states to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the probabilities by finding the components of |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of A.

So let's denote |+x⟩ = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x⟩ = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Then, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.

Our goal is to express |α⟩ as c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |−x⟩, and then the probabilities will be |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So let's compute c_+ and c_-. To find c_+, take the inner product of |+x⟩ with |α⟩. Similarly for c_-.

Given that |α⟩ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>,

Compute c_+ = ⟨+x|α⟩. 

⟨+x| is [ ⟨up| + ⟨down| ] / sqrt(2).

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * 1 ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let me expand that. It's [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Adding the numerators: (1+i +2 -i) = 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Similarly for c_- = ⟨-x|α⟩. ⟨-x| is [ ⟨up| - ⟨down| ] / sqrt(2).

So,

c_- = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )

= [1 +i -2 +i ] / ( sqrt(14) )

= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me compute that again. Numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Then, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14). So |c_+|² = (9)/(14).

Similarly, |c_-|² is | (-1 + 2i) |² / (14).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|² =5/14.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64286 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to our 9/14 and 5/14. But 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the first part of option A matches.

Wait, but let me check the average value of the operator. The average value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨α| A |α⟩.

Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenvalues λ_+ = ħ/2 and λ_- = -ħ/2, and the state |α⟩ has probabilities |c_+|² and |c_-|² of measuring these eigenvalues, the average value would be:

⟨A⟩ = |c_+|² * (ħ/2) + |c_-|² * (-ħ/2).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) ħ ] / (28) ) = (4 ħ)/(28) )= ħ/(7).

So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's a match.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value calculation.

Another approach: Compute A |alpha⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨alpha|.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, and the expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ for a spin-1/2 state is given by (α - β^* + α^* - β ) / (2 |c|^2 ), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

But in any case, the calculation using the eigenstates gives us ħ/7. So that's the average.

So the correct option should be A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The first step is to normalize the state. The normalization factor is determined by computing the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:  

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the normalization factor is } \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is the Pauli X matrix scaled by \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\). The eigenstates of \(A\) are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, given by:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \(A\), the state \(|α⟩\) is expressed as a linear combination of \(|+x⟩\) and \(|-x⟩\). The coefficients are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of the operator \(A\) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value of the operator is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\).**
