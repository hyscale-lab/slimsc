Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two parts, both reactions involving nitriles. The first part is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves another compound reacting with reagent B and water to form a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can undergo various reactions. The first reaction starts with butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but how does that form a nitrile? Oh wait, butanone reacting with cyanide... maybe it's a ketone reacting with a cyanide to form some addition product.

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, and I think that in the presence of a suitable base, it can form an enolate. Oh, wait, but here it's adding NaCN. Oh wait! Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't do that as readily as aldehydes. Or maybe under certain conditions, like with a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution? But butan-2-one doesn't have a good leaving group in that position.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If I add NaCN, which is a source of CN- nucleophile. Maybe it's a case of the cyanide attacking the carbonyl carbon, but ketones aren't usually as reactive as aldehydes for such additions. But maybe under acidic conditions, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, wait, that's the product. So the starting material is (CH3)2CO, and the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So it's like adding CN- to the carbonyl group, but with some kind of acid or base condition.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the reagent. I think this is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone. But ketones are less reactive than aldehydes. Maybe acid catalysis is needed. So, perhaps reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the ketone is first converted into a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a nitrile group is added to a carbonyl, forming an alcohol and a nitrile group. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The conditions for this are typically under acidic or sometimes basic conditions.

Wait, I think for cyanohydrin formation, you need to protonate the carbonyl oxygen first, making it more electrophilic. So the mechanism would be: H+ adds to carbonyl O, making O+ H2O, which leaves as H2O, leaving a carbocation (or in ketones, maybe a more stabilized carbocation). Then CN- attacks, then maybe deprotonation occurs.

So the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (proton source). So in the options, which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B have A as H3O+. So maybe A is H3O+.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when you have a ketone and you want to make a cyanohydrin, you might use HCN or a cyanide salt under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe using a base, but I think acid is more common for that.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → product (the cyanohydrin).

So the first part's answer is H3O+ as reagent A. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, using H2O and a strong acid like HCl, the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, more precisely, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves two steps. First, the nitrile is converted to an amide (in basic conditions) or an acyl chloride (in acidic conditions), then further hydrolysis to the acid.

Wait, but in the presence of water and an acid (like HCl), perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. So the reagent B could be HCl in water.

Wait, the reaction is: [2-hydroxybutanenitrile compound] + B (H2O) → [butanoic acid compound].

So the reagent B is used in this hydrolysis. So the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. What conditions are needed? I think in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl. So B is HCl, but wait, the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option C and D have B as HCl and CH3COOH, respectively.

Wait, but I thought that for the hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, HCl is used. Let me think. The nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done under strong acidic conditions, such as with concentrated HCl and heat. Alternatively, sometimes a mixture of HCl and water, perhaps with some other reagents.

Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis. So in the second reaction, B is HCl.

Wait, but let's think about the other option. If B were acetic acid, would that work? I don't think so. Because acetic acid is a weak acid. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid conditions.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

So putting it together: the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → which matches our conclusion.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → B is wrong.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → A is wrong.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → both wrong.

So the correct option is A.

The problem involves two reactions. In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the nitrile group is added to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed, the carbonyl group must be activated, typically under acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary acidic environment.

In the second reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Therefore, reagent B is HCl.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. A (NaHSO₃) is incorrect for the cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it provides the appropriate reagents for both reactions.

Answer: A
