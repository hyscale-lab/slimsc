Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is given as a matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually in quantum mechanics, you work in the eigenbasis of an observable for simplicity.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this is our state vector |ψ>.

I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z. From what I remember, the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So for P_z, I'll compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. Since |ψ> is an eigenstate of P_x, how does that affect P_z? Well, P_x and P_z are different observables, so they don't necessarily commute. If they don't commute, then measuring one affects the other, which is why there's uncertainty.

But the state given is already expressed in the P_z basis. So maybe it's easier to compute the expectation values directly without needing to change the basis? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix P_z is diagonal. Let me check that.

Looking at the P_z matrix:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)
So, yes, it's diagonal in the z-basis. That's good because it simplifies calculations.

So the state |ψ> is a column vector (a, b, c), where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Each component of |ψ> is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then summed.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a * (ħ) + b * (0) + c * (-ħ)
= (-1/2) * ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ)
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
Wait, that adds up to zero? Because (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) is zero. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, interesting. Now I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared would have the same eigenvectors, just the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.

So P_z² matrix would be:
(ħ², 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0)
(0, 0, ħ²)
Because (P_z)^2 for each diagonal element is (ħ)^2 and (-ħ)^2, which is ħ² each.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ²
= ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ²
= (1/4) * ħ² + 0 + (1/4) * ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ²

So now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )
But ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so it's sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) * ħ
Which is ħ / sqrt(2)

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations just to be sure.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩ again:
Each component is (a, b, c) multiplied by (ħ, 0, -ħ). So a = -1/2, so (-1/2)*ħ is -ħ/2. c is -1/2, so (-1/2)*(-ħ) is +ħ/2. Adding these, -ħ/2 + ħ/2 = 0. Correct.

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is each component squared times ħ², since P_z^2 is (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2).

So a^2 is (1/4), c^2 is (1/4). So 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2. Multiply by ħ² to get (1/2) ħ².

So yes, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)). So option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal in the $P_z$ basis:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = a \cdot \hbar + b \cdot 0 + c \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = a^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
