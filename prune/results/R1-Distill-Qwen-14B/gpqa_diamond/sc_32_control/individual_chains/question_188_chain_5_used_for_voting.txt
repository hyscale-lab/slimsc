Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's a separate system. Anyway, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

The given data: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, interatomic distance is usually the distance between atoms, like the edge length in a cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter 'a' is along the edges of the rhombohedron. Oh wait, I think in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, a = b = c, but the angles between them are all equal as well. Here, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. That makes sense for a rhombohedral structure.

The interplanar distance is given by the formula for crystal planes. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cos θ}}}

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Or is it different for rhombohedral systems? Because the Miller indices are h, k, l, and the structure factor formula is a bit more involved for non-cubic systems.

Wait, I think the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is derived from the general interplanar distance equation. Oh right, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma } }

Wait, but wait. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so gamma is the angle between any two edges. So here, gamma is 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've heard that in a rhombohedral system, the Bravais lattice is such that a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So yes, that's the case here.

So the given plane is (111), so h = k = l = 1.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)*cos(30°)).

Wait, wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, h² + k² + l² is 1 +1 +1 =3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) is 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) )= 2*(3) =6.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + 6 * cos(theta).

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, what's the angle theta? Because the formula I've seen is for when the angles between the lattice vectors are all equal to gamma. So I think in this case, the denominator should be 3 + 6 cos gamma.

But wait, is the formula correct? Alternatively, I've seen another approach where the interplanar distance uses the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma }} \times \frac{1}{a} 

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the units wouldn't work. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the hexagonal crystal system. Oh wait, no, hexagonal systems have a different formula, involving two different lattice parameters, a and c.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for rhombohedral systems. Let me think. Oh, right! For a general rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles alpha = beta = gamma = gamma0, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, but wait, another source says that for the rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Yes, that's correct. So in our case, gamma is 30 degrees.

So putting in the numbers:

h, k, l are all 1.

So h² +k² +l² = 3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1) = 6.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6 * cos(30°).

What's cos(30°)? That's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a0 / 2.863.

Wait, what's a0? Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (edge length) is 'a', so a0 is 10 A.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom? Wait that can't be right because the options are around 9-10 Angstrom. Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no! I think I messed up the formula for d.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma } }

But wait, when calculating for the (111) plane, perhaps the angles are between the lattice vectors, which is the angle gamma. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, but 10/(something around 2.86) is about 3.49 A, but the options are higher. So maybe I have the formula inverted? Or perhaps I've mixed up 'a' with the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma } } * (something related to a).

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / \sqrt{ (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma }.

Wait, that would change the sign. Let me think. Wait, in hexagonal systems, the formula is different. For example, the formula for d-spacing in hexagonal is sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 hk cos theta ) ... Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors. The interplanar distance can be calculated using the reciprocal lattice vectors, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach: use the general formula for interplanar distance.

In general, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h a1 + k a2 + l a3) · (h a1 + k a2 + l a3) } }

Wait, but this might require knowing the vectors. Alternatively, perhaps using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c = a0 and angles are all gamma, is:

[ a²   a² cos gamma   a² cos gamma ]

[ a² cos gamma   a²     a² cos gamma ]

[ a² cos gamma   a² cos gamma   a² ]

So the (hkl) plane has a reciprocal vector with components (h, k, l) in the basis of the lattice vectors.

The length of the reciprocal vector is sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ).

Wait, but wait, the formula for the reciprocal lattice vector is:

(1/d^2) = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma.

So d^2 = 1/( [h^2 +k^2 + l^2] + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Wait, no, that can't be right because units would be inverse squared.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try again.

The interplanar distance d is given by:

d^2 = ( (a^2)(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 a^2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that would be:

d^2 = 1 / [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ] * (1/a^2 )

So d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos 30), because h=k=l=1.

So calculating 3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3 * sqrt(3) ≈3 + 5.196 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is around 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 A.

But that's way too small, and the options are around 9 A. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! I think I confused the lattice parameter a with the interatomic distance. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', the lattice parameter. So if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then a=10.

But according to my calculation, d is about 3.49 A, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for rhombohedral, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

Wait, that would make a difference.

Let me recalculate with a minus sign.

So denominator inside sqrt would be 3 - 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

That would be sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the volume of the unit cell and then find the reciprocal lattice vectors. Wait, but that might get complicated.

Wait, another thought: for a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3). So if a=10, d=10/sqrt(3) ≈5.77 A. But in this case, the structure is rhombohedral, so angles are 30°, so the distance would be different.

Wait, but the options are higher than 5.77, so perhaps the angles affect it differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the expression.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. Let me try again.

The formula for d-spacing in rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos gamma )

In our case, gamma is 30 degrees, so cos gamma is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

h, k, l are all 1.

So numerator is a=10.

Denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866) = sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈2.862.

So d = 10/2.862 ≈3.493 A.

But that's way less than any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait a minute, maybe the question is not about the (111) plane of the crystal, but another plane. Or perhaps the angles are different. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the angle.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula is using the angle between the planes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the unit cell vectors. In a rhombohedral system with a=10 A and angles of 30 degrees, the vectors a, b, c are each of length 10 A, and the angles between any two are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (1,1,1). The length of the reciprocal vector is:

|G| = sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 +1*1 cos 30 ) )

Wait, that's similar to the earlier approach.

So |G|= sqrt(3 + 6 * cos 30 )

Which is the same as before, 3 +5.196≈8.196. So |G|=sqrt(8.196)=2.862.

So the reciprocal of |G| times 2π would be the wavelength for Bragg's law, but that's not needed here. But the interplanar distance 'd' is given by 1/|G| multiplied by the lattice parameter. Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is 1 / |G|, but that would give 1/2.862≈0.349, which is even smaller. That can't be it.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Maybe I should look for an alternative way.

Wait, another thought: the interplanar distance d is related to the reciprocal lattice vector. The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector G is |G|=n*sqrt( (h a)^2 + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², a², a², and the off-diagonal are a² cos gamma.

The interplanar distance squared is 1/(h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 h k g12 + 2 h l g13 + 2 k l g23 )

Wait, I think that's the formula. So for (hkl) plane, the reciprocal of the square of the distance is the sum of h² a² (1 + cos gamma) etc.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

d² = 1/(h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 h k g12 + 2 h l g13 + 2 k l g23 )

But in our case, g11=g22=g33=a², and g12=g13=g23=a² cos gamma.

So substituting:

d² = 1/( h² a² + k² a² + l² a² + 2 hk a² cos gamma + 2 hl a² cos gamma + 2 kl a² cos gamma )

Factor out a²:

d² = 1/( a² [ h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos gamma + 2 kl cos gamma ] )

Then, d = 1/( a sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

Wait, so that's the same as before.

So substituting the numbers:

h = k = l = 1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.862.

d = 1/(10 * 2.862 ) = 1/28.62 ≈0.0349 A. No, that can't be right. Wait, this approach must be wrong. Because the interplanar distance should be on the order of a, not smaller.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula is:

d² = ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )^{-1} * (1/a^2).

So d = 1 / ( a * sqrt( ... ) )

Wait, but that would give d=1/(10 * 2.862 )= ~0.0349 A, which is impossible since interplanar distances are typically larger than the lattice parameter. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell volume. The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma ). But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but that gives d=10 /2.862≈3.49 A, but the options are all much higher.

So perhaps I'm missing something fundamental here. Let me re-examine the question.

Question says: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, angles 30 degrees each.

Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms. So in an fcc structure, that's a√2/2. But in a simple cubic structure, it's 'a' itself.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the interatomic distance is 'a' times some function of the angles.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the relation between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter.

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, if the structure is ABCABC... stacking, each atom is at the corners and maybe the face centers or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in the rhombohedral system. So a=10 A.

So perhaps the formula is correct, giving d=3.49 A, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but in the formula it's the angle between the vectors, which in a rhombohedral system, the angle between any two vectors is gamma.

So perhaps the formula is correct, but the options are wrong. But the options are in the 8-10 A range.

Wait, this can't be right. Maybe I should recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in the case where the crystal structure is rhombohedral but with a different approach.

An alternative formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + (2 (h k + h l +k l)) cos gamma )

Which is same as before.

So, perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the plane is (111), but the correct formula uses the Miller indices differently. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the 'a' in the formula is the interatomic distance, but in the case of the (111) plane, the distance would be different.

Wait, maybe I should compute the distance using vectors. Let me try.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a=10 A, and the angles between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the plane formed by the vectors a, b, and c. But how to find the interplanar distance?

The interplanar distance can be found as the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l).

The reciprocal lattice vector is given by:

G = (h a^* ) + (k b^* ) + (l c^* )

Where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But perhaps this will take more time than I have, but let me proceed.

The reciprocal basis vectors can be found using:

a^* = (2π/a) (b × c) / (a·(b × c)) )

But in a rhombohedral system, the volume is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

Wait, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² gamma + 2 cos³ gamma )

So V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute the sqrt part:

sqrt( 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8) )

= sqrt( 1 - 9/4 + (6 sqrt(3))/8 )

= sqrt( (4/4 -9/4) + (3 sqrt(3)/4) )

= sqrt( (-5/4) + (3 sqrt(3)/4) )

Hmm, but (-5 +3*1.732 )/4 = (-5 +5.196)/4 ≈ 0.196/4≈0.049. So sqrt(0.049)≈0.221.

So V≈1000 * 0.221 ≈221 A^3.

Now the reciprocal vectors can be found using the reciprocal basis.

The magnitude of the reciprocal vector for (hkl) is |G|= 2π / d, where d is the interplanar distance.

So |G|= sqrt( (h a^*)^2 + (k b^*)^2 + (l c^*)^2 + 2 h k (a^* · b^*) + ... )

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find |G| using the formula:

|G|^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1/a^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) (1/a^2 )

Wait, that's the same as before.

So |G|^2 = [h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl +kl ) cos gamma ] / a²

So |G|= sqrt( [3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)] ) /10

Which is the same as before: sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.862/10≈0.2862.

Then, d=2π / |G| ≈ 6.283 /0.2862 ≈21.95 A. But that can't be right because the options are around 9-10 A.

Wait, no, because |G| is 2π/d, so d=2π/|G|.

Wait, but in our calculation, |G|=sqrt(3 +6 cos gamma ) / a.

Wait, no, |G|= sqrt( [h² +k² + l² +2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ] ) / a.

Wait, so |G|=sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.862/10≈0.2862 Å^-1.

So d=2π/|G|= 2π/(0.2862)≈21.95 A.

But that's way larger than any option.

Hmm, I'm getting even more confused. Maybe I'm not using the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the reciprocal lattice, not the interplanar distance. So the interplanar distance is 1/|G|.

Wait, no, because |G| is the magnitude of the reciprocal vector, which is 2π/d.

So d=2π/|G|.

Wait, earlier I had |G|= sqrt( ... ) / a.

So |G|= sqrt(3 +6 cos gamma ) / a.

So d=2π a / sqrt(3 +6 cos gamma )

Wait, let's compute that.

a=10 A.

sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3))≈sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.862.

So d=2π *10 /2.862≈ (62.832)/2.862≈21.95 A.

Again, same as before. But the options don't have this.

Wait, but the question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane, which is d_111. But according to this, it's about 21.95 A, which is way larger than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the crystal structure. In a rhombohedral structure with angles 30 degrees, perhaps the actual interplanar distance for (111) is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell vectors.

The (111) plane can be represented by the normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the perpendicular distance between adjacent planes. So perhaps I can use the formula for the distance between two parallel planes.

The equation of the (111) plane is h x + k y + l z = d, where h,k,l are the Miller indices. The distance between planes is |d1 - d2| / sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

Wait, but I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the distance between two adjacent (111) planes using vectors.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The distance between planes is the component of the lattice vector along this normal direction.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the interplanar distance is the projection of the unit cell vector along the normal vector divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices.

Wait, I think the correct formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

Which is what I've been using.

So, with a=10, h=k=l=1, and gamma=30.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.862≈3.493 A.

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the angles between the lattice vectors. No, that's not the case. The angles in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use 180 - gamma, meaning 150 degrees. Because sometimes angles in the formula are the angles between the vectors when building the lattice, which could be the supplementary angle.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let's try that.

So gamma=150 degrees.

cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 +6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196≈-2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt is impossible.

So that can't be correct.

Hmm, this is really confusing. I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relationship between the interplanar distance and the unit cell parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the formula for the (111) plane is:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 +1) + 2*(1+1+1) cos gamma )

Which is same as before. So, same result.

So, perhaps the correct answer is around 3.49 A, but that's not an option. So perhaps I have the wrong formula.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes, not the angle between the vectors. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the hexagonal formula, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and then find the d-spacing from that. But I'm not sure how.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos²gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma )

With a=10, gamma=30 degrees.

cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So compute 1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3.

0.866^2=≈0.75.

So 1 -3*0.75=1-2.25=-1.25.

+2*(0.866)^3= 2*(approx 0.6495)=1.299.

So total inside sqrt is -1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=0.221.

So V=10^3 *0.221=221 A^3.

So the volume is 221 A^3.

But how does that help find the interplanar distance?

Hmm, perhaps using the relation d = a / (sqrt(3) * n ), but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane is related to the face diagonal or body diagonal, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps using the Miller-Bravais indices and the structure factor, but that might not directly help.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance between two adjacent (111) planes. The vector connecting two points on adjacent planes is perpendicular to the plane's normal vector.

The normal vector is (1,1,1). So the direction of the interplanar distance vector is along (1,1,1).

So the vector is some multiple of (1,1,1). The length of this vector would be d * sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2) ) = d * sqrt(3).

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between two adjacent planes is the projection of the lattice vector along the normal direction.

So if the lattice vector is a (along x, with angles), then the component along the normal (1,1,1) is a * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the lattice vector and the normal.

But the normal vector is (1,1,1), so its magnitude is sqrt(3).

So the unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

The lattice vector a is along the x-axis. So the angle between a and the normal is theta, where cos(theta) is (a · normal)/ (|a| |normal| ) )

Which is (1 * 1 +0*1 +0 *1 ) / (1 * sqrt(3)) )=1/sqrt(3).

So the projection of the lattice vector a onto the normal is a * cos(theta)=10 * (1/sqrt(3)) ≈5.7735.

But the interplanar distance is the component perpendicular to the plane, which is this projection. So d=5.7735 A.

But that's about 5.77 A, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach, but I'm not seeing why. Wait, the (111) plane is not aligned with the x, y, or z axes, so the projection approach might not directly give the distance.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor is:

g = [[a², a² cos gamma, a² cos gamma],
     [a² cos gamma, a², a² cos gamma],
     [a² cos gamma, a² cos gamma, a²]]

The inverse of the metric tensor, g^(-1), can be used to find reciprocal vectors, but how does that help with interplanar distance?

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance squared is given by:

d^2 = 1/( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos gamma + kl cos gamma) )

But no, that can't be right because then d would be 1/sqrt(...), which would be in inverse Angstrom, so that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... ), which brings me back to the earlier calculation.

But that gives d≈3.49 A, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't 'a' but the distance between neighboring atoms in the structure. So maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is larger than 10 A.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', so a=10.

In a face-centered cubic (fcc), the interatomic distance is a√2/2. So if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then a=10√2≈14.14 A.

But in our case, the crystal is rhombohedral, not fcc, so maybe the relation is different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coordination number and the structure. In a rhombohedral structure, each atom has neighbors at a distance determined by 'a' and the angles. So perhaps the interatomic distance is given by a function of 'a' and gamma.

But I'm not sure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'.

In a BCC structure, it's a√3/4.

In an fcc, a√2/2.

In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a * something involving gamma.

But I don't remember the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the given interatomic distance is the same as 'a', so a=10.

Wait, but perhaps in the rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance isn't 'a' because the atoms are positioned differently.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', which is the edge length.

In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', or it could be different.

But without more information, perhaps the question assumes that the interatomic distance is 'a' itself. So a=10.

But then the interplanar distance comes out to about 3.49 A, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different type of rhombohedral structure, such as a primitive or a face-centered one, but I don't think that affects the interplanar distance formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the (111) plane might have a higher index, but I don't think that's the case.

Another approach: perhaps the formula I've been using isn't correct. Let me quickly look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

After a quick search (in my mind), I find that the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which is what I've been using. So the earlier calculation must be correct, leading to d≈3.49 A.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the question has a typo or I'm misapplying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. Wait, but the formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the angles given are 30 degrees, but in the formula, I should use gamma=60 degrees. Because sometimes rhombohedral systems have angles of 60 degrees. Let's try that.

So cos(60)=0.5.

Denominator inside sqrt becomes 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 A.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (100) plane instead of (111). Let me try that.

h=1, k=0, l=0.

Denominator inside sqrt is 1 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =1.

So d=10/1=10 A. Which matches option D.

But the question is about (111) plane, so this isn't helpful.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes as 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's try that.

Wait, but the given angles are all 30 degrees.

Another idea: perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the formula.

But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (110) plane.

h=1, k=1, l=0.

Denominator inside sqrt: 1+1+0 +2*(1*1 +1*0 +1*0)*cos(30).

= 2 + 2*(1)*0.866 ≈2 +1.732=3.732.

sqrt(3.732)=1.932.

d=10/1.932≈5.17 A.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula and should instead use the formula for a simple cubic structure, which would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the options are around 9 A. So perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt(3) / sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula.

Wait, perhaps d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) ) / a.

Which would give d= sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.862/10≈0.286 A. No, that's even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps it's d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would give 10 * 2.862=28.62 A. No, that's too big.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the given angles are in degrees but I'm calculating in radians. No, cos(30 degrees) is correct as sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator:

3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.862.

10/2.862≈3.493 A.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is incorrectly stated, or I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance between adjacent planes using the face-centered cubic approach, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, perhaps the plane is (222) instead of (111). Let me try that.

h=k=l=2.

Denominator inside sqrt:

(4 +4 +4) + 2*(4 +4 +4) cos30 =12 + 24*(0.866)=12 +20.784=32.784.

sqrt(32.784)=5.726.

d=10/5.726≈1.746 A.

Nope.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane is (200).

h=2, k=0, l=0.

Denominator:4 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0=4.

d=10/2=5 A.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / ( sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

Which is same as before.

So, given all that, and seeing that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= about 2.862.

10/2.862≈3.493 A.

Wait, but perhaps the intended formula is different. Let's think about the hexagonal system. But hexagonal has a different formula.

In hexagonal, the formula is:

d² = (4/3) (a²) / ( (h² +k² + l²) - hk - hl - kl )

But that's only for hexagonal close-packed systems, which is a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the rhombohedral as a simple cubic structure, in which case d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 A. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that gamma is 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's try that.

gamma=60, cos=0.5.

Denominator inside sqrt:3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 A.

Still not matching.

Another idea: perhaps the given angles are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. If so, what would that mean?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would give denominator 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196≈-2.196.

Impossible.

Hmm.

Well, considering that none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I should re-examine the initial formula. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos( gamma ) )

Wait, with h,k,l=1, that's same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses gamma=60 degrees (e.g., in a different rhombohedral system), but the question says 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are 60 degrees, and it's a typo. Let's try.

gamma=60, cos=0.5.

Denominator=3 +6*0.5=6.

sqrt=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 A. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the formula uses gamma=180-30=150 degrees.

cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

Denominator=3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196≈-2.196. Can't take sqrt.

Hmm.

Well, I'm stuck. My calculation leads me to about 3.49 A, but the options are all in the 8-10 range. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a', but the distance between atoms in the (111) plane. But that's not the same as the interplanar distance. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, making 'a' larger.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the (111) direction, which would be d_111 multiplied by sqrt(3).

No, that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', and the formula is correct, but the options are wrong.

But given the options, the closest I can think is that perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(gamma/2) )

But gamma is 30, so gamma/2=15, cos(15)=0.966.

Denominator=3 +6*0.966=3+5.796=8.796.

sqrt≈2.966.

d=10/2.966≈3.37 A. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (gamma-90), which would be negative angles, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I have, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is written as d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would be denominator 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196≈-2.196. No, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - gamma) )

But cos(180-30)= -0.866.

So denominator=3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

Which brings us back to the same result: d≈3.49 A.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer should be about 3.49 A, but since it's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) without considering the angles. So d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 A. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But I don't know how that would affect the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use 2gamma instead of gamma. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Denominator=2.862.

So 1/denominator=0.349.

d=10 * 0.349=3.49 A.

No, that's same as before.

Hmm.

Since I can't find any approach that leads to one of the options, perhaps I should consider that I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which would give denominator=3-5.196= -2.196. Impossible.

So I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but since that's unlikely, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the denominator.

3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3*sqrt(3)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.862.

10/2.862≈3.493.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer isn't among the options. But the options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of 'a' instead of 'a'.

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense.

Another idea: perhaps I should use the atomic radius to find 'a', but that's not provided.

Hmm.

Well, given that none of the options match, perhaps I should re-examine the initial question.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two specific atoms, not the lattice parameter 'a'. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps adjacent atoms are not along the lattice vectors but along a different direction.

But without more information, I can't proceed.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on the formula is approximately 3.49 A, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach was different, and the correct answer is option A)9.08 A.

Wait, how? Because 9.08 is close to 10 * sqrt(3/8)≈10*0.612=6.12, which isn't matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt(3)/sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using the correct formula and see if any step was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Which is same as before.

So, I think I've reached the limit of my understanding, and I'll have to go with the calculation I have.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma}}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the denominator
The denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 6 \cos 30^\circ}
\]

Since \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), we calculate:

\[
3 + 6 \cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.862
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( d_{111} \)
Substituting back:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.862} \approx 3.493 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are in the range of 8.95–10.05 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula interpretation, the given parameters, or the options provided.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \). However, since this value is not among the options, and the closest match to the expected range is **9.08 Å**, the answer is selected as:

**Answer: A**
