Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics and matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QM, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question provides four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options A to D make statements about these matrices and their properties. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let me start by recalling some key concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, also known as the time evolution operator, is unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that their conjugate transpose is their inverse. So, for a matrix U to be unitary, U† * U = I (identity matrix).

Another important point is that the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Wait, right, because if A is skew-Hermitian (A† = -A), then e^A is unitary. Similarly, for Hermitian matrices, exponentials are unitary only under certain conditions, maybe when multiplied by i.

So looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Well, if e^X is unitary, multiplying a vector by it wouldn't change the vector's norm. Because unitary transformations preserve the norm. So if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. So I need to check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian means that X† = -X. Let me compute X† and see.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate transpose (X†) would be the transpose of the complex conjugate of each element.

Transposing X: columns become rows.

Original X:

[ i   -1   2i ]
[ 1    0    1 ]
[2i   -1   -i ]

Complex conjugate of each element:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Wait wait, no. When taking the conjugate, each element is conjugated. So for X, the elements are:

Element (1,1) is i → conjugate is -i
(1,2) is -1 → conjugate is -1
(1,3) is 2i → -2i
(2,1) is 1 → 1
(2,2) is 0 → 0
(2,3) is 1 → 1
(3,1) is 2i → -2i
(3,2) is -1 → -1
(3,3) is -i → i

So the conjugate matrix is:

[ -i   -1    -2i ]
[ 1     0     1  ]
[ -2i  -1     i ]

Then, the transpose of that is X†.

So transpose of the conjugate matrix:

Columns become rows.

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, let me write it properly:

X† would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i (from column 1)
Row 2: -1, 0, -1 (from column 2)
Row 3: -2i, 1, i (from column 3)

Wait no, perhaps I should write the conjugate transpose correctly. Let's do it column by column.

Original X matrix:

Row 1: [i (1,1), -1 (1,2), 2i (1,3)]
Row 2: [1 (2,1), 0 (2,2), 1 (2,3)]
Row 3: [2i (3,1), -1 (3,2), -i (3,3)]

Conjugate each element:

(1,1): i → -i
(1,2): -1 → -1
(1,3): 2i → -2i
(2,1):1 →1
(2,2):0 →0
(2,3):1 →1
(3,1):2i →-2i
(3,2):-1 →-1
(3,3):-i →i

So the conjugated matrix is:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now, the transpose of this is the conjugate transpose (X†):

So, for the first column of the conjugate matrix:
- i (from row 1, column 1)
1 (row 2, column 1)
-2i (row 3, column 1)

So X† row 1 is [ -i, 1, -2i ]
X† row 2: [ -1, 0, -1 ]
X† row 3: [ -2i, 1, i ]

Wait, no. Let me think: the conjugate matrix is:

[ -i   -1    -2i ]
[ 1     0     1  ]
[ -2i  -1     i ]

Transposing this would make the first row of X† the first column of the conjugate matrix. So:

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, no. Wait, the first element of the transpose is the first element of the original. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me construct X† step by step.

The conjugate matrix is:
C = [ [ -i, -1, -2i ],
       [ 1, 0, 1 ],
       [ -2i, -1, i ] ]

The transpose of C will have elements where row and column indices are swapped.

So, element (1,1) in C is -i → same in transpose.
Element (1,2) in C is -1 → becomes (2,1) in transpose.
Element (1,3) in C is -2i → becomes (3,1) in transpose.

Element (2,1) in C is 1 → becomes (1,2) in transpose.
Element (2,2) is 0 → (2,2).
Element (2,3) is 1 → becomes (3,2) in transpose.

Element (3,1) in C is -2i → becomes (1,3) in transpose.
Element (3,2) in C is -1 → becomes (2,3) in transpose.
Element (3,3) is i → (3,3).

So X† (transpose of C) is:

Row 1: [-i, 1, -2i]
Row 2: [-1, 0, -1]
Row 3: [-2i, 1, i]

Now, let me compute -X. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3:2i, -1, -i

So -X is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, compare this to X†. X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Which is exactly the same as -X. So X† = -X, which means X is skew-Hermitian.

Ah, so X is skew-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X will be unitary because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that when you multiply a vector by them, the norm remains the same. So, option A says that there's a vector where e^X changes the norm. But since e^X is unitary, this can't be true. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Are you sure it's unitary? Because for a unitary matrix U, U U† = I. Alternatively, since X is skew-Hermitian, e^X is unitary. So e^X is unitary, which implies that for any vector v, ||e^X v|| = ||v||. So option A is incorrect because e^X doesn't change the norm of any vector; it preserves it.

So A is false.

Option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Quantum states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. Alternatively, a pure state can be written as |ψ><ψ|, which is also a density matrix.

But (e^X Y e^{-X}) would be a similarity transform. Since e^X is unitary, this similarity transform would conjugate Y with e^X. So Y is transformed into Y' = e^X Y e^{-X}.

Wait, but what is Y? Y is given as:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row 3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

It's a real symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian. Because Y = Y^T, and since all elements are real, Y† = Y^T = Y. So Y is Hermitian. So Y is an observable.

But when you conjugate Y with a unitary matrix (e^X), the result is still Hermitian. Because if Y is Hermitian, then U Y U† is also Hermitian. Because (U Y U†)† = U Y† U† = U Y U†.

So the product (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is Hermitian because e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, which is (e^X)† since e^X is unitary. So (e^X Y e^{-X}) is Hermitian.

But is it a density matrix? Well, it depends on whether it's positive semi-definite and has trace 1. But regardless, the question is about whether it represents a quantum state. Any density matrix is a quantum state. But does (e^X Y e^{-X}) necessarily have trace 1 and be positive semi-definite?

Y itself has a trace of 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. Because 0.5 + 0.25 is 0.75, plus another 0.25 is 1. So Y has trace 1.

When you perform a similarity transformation with a unitary matrix, the trace remains the same. So the transformed matrix will also have trace 1. Also, since Y is positive semi-definite (it's a covariance matrix kind of structure), perhaps the transformed matrix is also positive semi-definite.

Wait, but Y is not necessarily positive semi-definite. Let me check the eigenvalues. Alternatively, since Y is a real symmetric matrix, it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me compute its determinant quickly.

But perhaps that's taking too long. Alternatively, think about whether the similarity transformation with a unitary matrix would preserve positive semi-definiteness. Since unitary transformations are orthogonal in the real case, and orthogonal transformations preserve lengths, but in the complex case, they preserve inner products. So if Y is positive semi-definite, then U Y U† is also positive semi-definite. So if Y is, then the transformed version is.

Wait, but Y is given as:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

Is this matrix positive semi-definite? Let's check its leading minors.

First minor: 0.5 >0.

Second leading minor: determinant of top-left 2x2 matrix.

(0.5)(0.25) - (0.1)^2 = 0.125 - 0.01 = 0.115>0.

Third leading minor is determinant of the full matrix. Let me compute it.

Compute determinant of Y:

0.5 0.1 0.2

0.1 0.25 0.1

0.2 0.1 0.25

Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

Let me compute the determinant:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

where a=0.5, b=0.1, c=0.2,

d=0.1, e=0.25, f=0.1,

g=0.2, h=0.1, i=0.25.

Compute term1: a(ei - fh) = 0.5*(0.25*0.25 - 0.1*0.1) = 0.5*(0.0625 - 0.01) = 0.5*(0.0525) = 0.02625

term2: -b*(di - fg) = -0.1*(0.1*0.25 - 0.1*0.2) = -0.1*(0.025 - 0.02) = -0.1*(0.005) = -0.0005

term3: c*(dh - eg) = 0.2*(0.1*0.1 - 0.25*0.2) = 0.2*(0.01 - 0.05) = 0.2*(-0.04) = -0.008

Sum the three terms: 0.02625 -0.0005 -0.008 = 0.02625 - 0.0085 = 0.01775.

So determinant is positive. So all leading minors are positive, which means Y is positive definite. So it's positive semi-definite (actually, definite) and Hermitian, and has trace 1. So Y is a valid density matrix, a quantum state.

But after the transformation by e^X, the matrix becomes e^X Y e^{-X}, which is similar to Y. Since Y is positive definite with trace 1, the transformed matrix will also be positive definite with trace 1. Therefore, (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is also a valid quantum state (density matrix). So option B would be correct.

Wait, but wait. The question says "represents a quantum state." So yes, option B is correct if that's true. But let me check other options to be thorough.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are Hermitian matrices. So are Z and X Hermitian?

X was already checked: it's skew-Hermitian (X† = -X). So X is not Hermitian (unless X is zero, which it isn't). So X is not an observable.

Z is given as:

Row 1: 3, 2i, 5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3:5,4i,4

Let's compute Z†.

Original Z:

[3     2i      5  ]

[-2i   -2     -4i ]

[5     4i      4 ]

Conjugate each element:

(1,1): 3 →3

(1,2): 2i → -2i

(1,3):5 →5

(2,1): -2i →2i

(2,2):-2 →-2

(2,3):-4i →4i

(3,1):5 →5

(3,2):4i →-4i

(3,3):4 →4

So Z† is:

Row 1: 3, 2i,5

Row 2:2i, -2,4i

Row 3:5, -4i,4

Compare Z and Z†. Are they equal?

Z is:

3 2i 5

-2i -2 -4i

5 4i 4

Z† is:

3 2i 5

2i -2 4i

5 -4i 4

So Z and Z† are not the same. For example, Z has -2i in (2,1), while Z† has 2i in (2,1). So Z is not equal to Z†, hence Z is not Hermitian. Therefore, Z is not an observable. So option C is incorrect because both Z and X are not Hermitian; X is skew-Hermitian and Z is neither.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is unitary. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, W:

W is given as:

Row 1: 0, 0,1

Row 2:0,1,0

Row3:1,0,0

So W is a permutation matrix, swapping the basis vectors. Let's compute W† and W W†.

W is real and symmetric, so W† = W^T. Since W is symmetric (since W is equal to its transpose), W† = W. So W is orthogonal if W W^T = I.

Compute W*W^T:

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

W^T is same as W, so W*W^T is:

(0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1) (0*0 + 0*1 + 1*0) (0*1 + 0*0 +1*0)

Wait, let me compute each element.

Each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of W and column j of W.

W W^T:

(0 0 1) . (0 0 1) →0+0+1=1 → (1,1)

(0 0 1) . (0 1 0) →0+0+0=0 → (1,2)

(0 0 1) . (0 0 0) →0+0+0=0 → (1,3)

Wait, no. W^T is same as W because W is symmetric. So W W^T is:

First row of W multiplied by first column of W: 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1.

First row of W multiplied by second column of W: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0.

First row of W multiplied by third column of W: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0.

Second row: 0 1 0.

Multiply by first column: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0.

Multiply by second column: 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Multiply by third column: 0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

Third row: 1 0 0.

Multiply by first column:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.

Multiply by second column:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Multiply by third column:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So the product is:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1 → which is the identity matrix.

So W is orthogonal, hence unitary. Because for real matrices, orthogonal implies unitary. So W is unitary.

X is skew-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary, but X itself is not unitary. Wait, is X unitary? Let me check.

Wait, X is skew-Hermitian, which makes e^X unitary, but X itself is not necessarily unitary. For example, if X is skew-Hermitian, X† = -X. So X X† = X (-X) = -X^2. So X X† = -X². For X to be unitary, X X† = I. So unless X² = -I, which is not the case here, X is not unitary. Let's compute X X† and see.

Wait, X is:

[ i   -1    2i ]

[ 1    0     1 ]

[2i   -1    -i ]

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i,1, i

Compute X X†.

Multiply X and X†.

Compute element (1,1):

Row 1 of X: i, -1, 2i.

Column 1 of X†: -i, -1, -2i.

Dot product: i*(-i) + (-1)*(-1) + 2i*(-2i).

Compute each term:

i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) =1.

(-1)*(-1) =1.

2i*(-2i)= -4i² = -4*(-1)=4.

Sum: 1 +1 +4=6.

Element (1,2):

Row 1 of X: i, -1, 2i.

Column 2 of X†:1,0,1.

Dot product: i*1 + (-1)*0 + 2i*1 = i + 0 + 2i = 3i.

Element (1,3):

Row1 X: i, -1, 2i.

Column3 X†: -2i, -1, i.

Dot product: i*(-2i) + (-1)*(-1) + 2i*i.

= (-2i²) +1 + 2i².

i² is -1, so:

-2*(-1) =2.

+1 =3.

2i² = 2*(-1) =-2.

Sum: 2 +1 -2=1.

Similarly, element (2,1):

Row 2 X:1,0,1.

Column1 X†: -i, -1, -2i.

Dot product: 1*(-i) +0*(-1) +1*(-2i) = -i -2i= -3i.

Element (2,2):

Row2 X:1,0,1.

Column2 X†:1,0,1.

Dot product:1*1 +0*0 +1*1=2.

Element (2,3):

Row2 X:1,0,1.

Column3 X†: -2i, -1, i.

Dot product:1*(-2i) +0*(-1) +1*i = -2i +i= -i.

Element (3,1):

Row3 X:2i, -1, -i.

Column1 X†: -i, -1, -2i.

Dot product: 2i*(-i) + (-1)*(-1) + (-i)*(-2i).

2i*(-i) = -2i²=2.

(-1)*(-1)=1.

(-i)*(-2i) =2i² = -2.

Sum: 2+1-2=1.

Element (3,2):

Row3 X:2i, -1, -i.

Column2 X†:1,0,1.

Dot product: 2i*1 + (-1)*0 + (-i)*1 = 2i -i =i.

Element (3,3):

Row3 X:2i, -1, -i.

Column3 X†:-2i, -1, i.

Dot product: 2i*(-2i) + (-1)*(-1) + (-i)*i.

= -4i² +1 + (-i^2).

i² is -1, so:

-4*(-1) =4.

+1.

+ (-(-1))=1.

Sum:4+1+1=6.

Putting it all together:

X X† = 

[6, 3i, 1;

-3i, 2, -i;

1, i, 6]

Which is definitely not the identity matrix. So X is not unitary; X X† ≠ I. Thus, X is not a unitary matrix. So option D says W and X are evolution operators. Since W is unitary, but X is not, option D is incorrect.

So reviewing the options:

A: e^X changes the norm of a vector → False, because e^X is unitary.

B: (e^X Y e^{-X}) is a quantum state → True, because it's a transformed version of Y, which is a state, and the transform preserves the properties of being a density matrix.

C: Z and X are observables → False, since neither is Hermitian.

D: W and X are evolution operators → False, because X is not unitary.

So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


In quantum mechanics, key concepts include the properties of matrices such as Hermiticity (for observables), unitarity (for evolution operators), and the behavior of matrix exponentials. The given matrices are analyzed as follows:

### Option A
The statement claims that there exists a vector for which the norm changes when multiplied by \( e^X \). For this to be true, \( e^X \) must not be unitary. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector they act on. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

### Option B
The expression \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) involves a similarity transformation of \( Y \) by the unitary matrix \( e^X \). Since \( Y \) is a Hermitian matrix with trace 1 and is positive semi-definite, it represents a valid quantum state (density matrix). The similarity transformation preserves these properties, meaning \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is also a valid quantum state. Thus, this statement is **true**.

### Option C
Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and \( Z \) is neither Hermitian nor skew-Hermitian. Therefore, neither \( X \) nor \( Z \) represents an observable. This statement is **false**.

### Option D
The evolution operator in quantum mechanics must be unitary. \( W \) is a permutation matrix, which is orthogonal and hence unitary. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, not unitary, as \( X X^\dagger \neq I \). Since \( X \) is not unitary, \( W \) and \( X \) cannot both represent evolution operators. This statement is **false**.

### Conclusion
The only correct statement is **B**, as \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**
