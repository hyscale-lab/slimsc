Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinate triplets. 

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But what exactly does this ρ represent?

So, I think this is a mixed state. Because each of the projectors |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are orthogonal. The coefficients are both 1/2, so the state is equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩. That makes sense for a mixed state, not a pure state.

Now, where is this state located in the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a pure state, which lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But a mixed state, like this one, should be somewhere inside the Bloch sphere.

Wait, what's the Bloch vector for this density matrix? The Bloch vector gives the coordinates (x, y, z) on the sphere. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me expand the given ρ. The identity matrix I would be (|0⟩⟨0| + |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So that's equal to (I)/2, because I have (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is the diagonal part of I, but I also have the off-diagonal terms. Wait, no, wait a second. The identity matrix for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]], and |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So ρ is (I)/2.

So according to the general form (I + r·σ)/2, if ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, then r must be zero. Because I/2 is the same as (I + 0·σ)/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), meaning the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but why would that be the case? The origin is the completely mixed state, which makes sense because this is an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the state is maximally mixed, which is why it's at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is an equal probability mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere.

Expanding the given \(\rho\), we see that it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which matches the general form \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right)\) only when \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
