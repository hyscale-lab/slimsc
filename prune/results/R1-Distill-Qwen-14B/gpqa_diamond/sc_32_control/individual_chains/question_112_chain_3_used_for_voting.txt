Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The rule given is Aij equals hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional, so we'll probably need to normalize it first. Then, the operator in question is given by this matrix Aij. Let me think about what A looks like.

Wait, the operator A has elements Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. But wait, for a 2x2 matrix? Because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates for the z-component, so the spin-1/2 system. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

In matrix form, since i and j can be 1 and 2 (assuming |up> is the first basis state and |down> the second), then A would have 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, no. Wait, because for 2x2, when i=1 and j=2, and vice versa, they are different, so A12 = A21 = hbar/2. The diagonals (i=j) are zero. So yes, that's correct. So the operator A is the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times X matrix. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But maybe that's getting ahead of myself. Let me proceed.

The first step is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A. Wait, but the operator A's eigenstates are different from the |up> and |down> states. Because |up> and |down> are eigenstates of S_z, while A is a spin-flip operator. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question isn't about measuring in the |up> and |down> basis, but in the eigenbasis of A. So perhaps we should find the eigenstates of A first, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A has eigenstates that are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ±hbar/2.

Wait but when you're measuring an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is projected onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

So the plan is: find the eigenvectors of A, express |alpha> in terms of these eigenvectors, then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, whose eigenvectors are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but wait: The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So let me find its eigenstates.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the equation would be:

| (-λ)   (hbar/2) |
| (hbar/2) (-λ) |

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → 
Row 1: (0 - λ) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,1). So normalized, it would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which is the |+x> state.

Similarly for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0 → 
Row 1: (0 + λ) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), which when normalized is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)), the |-x> state.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me first normalize |alpha>.

Let me write |alpha> = c ( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ), where c is the normalization constant.

Wait, actually, the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that expression, so perhaps the state is already normalized. Or maybe not. Let's compute the norm.

Compute the norm squared of (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The inner product would be (1+i)(1-i)* + (2 -i)(2 +i)*.

Wait, no: wait, |a|^2 = a a^*, so for the state a|up> + b|down>, the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

|b|^2 = (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +1 =5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So |alpha> must be multiplied by 1/sqrt(7) to make it normalized. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring in each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, compute the inner products < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >, then square their magnitudes.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7).

Multiplying these out:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> ) + (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

But <up|down> and <down|up> are zero because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So this simplifies to:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*0 ) + (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

So each term becomes:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Adding (1+i) and (2 -i):

1+2 =3, i -i =0 → 3.

So numerator becomes (1/sqrt(2)) *3 → 3/(sqrt(2)).

So total is [3/(sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(7) = 3 / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait: Let me double-check.

Wait, the calculation is (1+i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), and then (2 -i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but in the expression above, both terms are in the same bracket because of the sum. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, the first term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i), and the second term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i). So when you add them together, it's (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(2) → (3) / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's right. So < +x | alpha > is (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is the square of the magnitude.

So |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, let's compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7).

Expanding this:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> ) 
    - (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Again, <up|down> and <down|up> are zero. So:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 ) ) 
    - (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Which simplifies to:

= [ (1+i) / sqrt(2) - (2 -i) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7).

Combine the terms:

= [ (1+i - 2 + i ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7).

Simplify numerator: (1-2) + (i +i) → (-1 + 2i).

So numerator: (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait: the probability for |-x> is | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 → (1+4)/14=5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which checks out.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) for |+x> and 5/14 (~0.357) for |-x>.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because I'm seeing that the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which add up to 1.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which have probabilities close to these.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

0.64 is ~9/14 ≈0.6428, 0.36 is ~5.04/14. Hmm, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

Wait, but let me check the other parts.

The average value, which is the expectation value of A. The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and the expectation value of σ_x for a state |psi> is <sigma_x> = <psi| sigma_x |psi>.

We can compute it directly.

Alternatively, using the eigenvalues and probabilities.

The expectation value of A is sum ( eigenvalue * probability ).

So eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14.

So expectation value = (hbar/2)(9/14) + (-hbar/2)(5/14) ) = (9-5)/(2*14) hbar = (4)/(28) hbar = (2/14) hbar= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at option A: average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is the first option.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, wait another approach: The expectation value can be calculated as < A > = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Because A is (hbar/2) σ_x, then <A> = (hbar/2) < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

We can compute <sigma_x> for |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is (1+i |up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Sigma_x is the Pauli x matrix, which in the z basis is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So <alpha | sigma_x | alpha > is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * sigma_x * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

= (1-i)(2 -i)/7 + (2+i)(1+i)/7.

Compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i + (-1) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i²
= 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So < sigma_x > = 2/7.

So < A > = (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what we got earlier.

So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, with average hbar/7.

But wait, let me check option D: 0.61 and 0.29. That adds up to 0.9, which can't be right. So option A must be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: option D's average is 2 hbar / sqrt(7). Let me see: 2/sqrt(7) is about 0.7559. hbar times that is around 0.7559 hbar.

But our calculation says average is 1/7 hbar, which is about 0.1429 hbar.

So option A's average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the correct option should be A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and finding the average value of \( A \) for a given quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \). The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) is defined by a matrix with elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and eigenstates:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are calculated by projecting \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The projection coefficients are:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right) \), compute:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right).
\]
Expanding:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i, \quad \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1}{7} (1 - 3i + 1 + 3i) = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
