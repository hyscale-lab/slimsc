Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, and I need to determine the chemical formula from the options provided.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines) groups. Since the options here are all oxygen-containing, maybe O-H is more likely here.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower. What functional groups could that be? Maybe conjugated carbonyl groups or an aromatic ring with substitution. Or perhaps it's an ester, amide, or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic C=C stretch. Let me think—carbonyls are around 1700, and conjugated ones (like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone) might be a bit lower, like 1680 or so. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with C=C at around 1600-1650. Wait, but I also have the NMR info which says there are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are on a CH2=CH group, so that suggests a double bond. So the 1650 peak is probably the C=C stretch, maybe in an aromatic ring or an alkene.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. That could be an alkene or an aromatic ring. If it's an aromatic ring, protons would typically be around 7 ppm, but vinyl (like CH2=CH-) would be lower, maybe around 5 ppm or so, depending. I'm not super sure about the exact chemical shifts, but the presence of vinyl H's suggests a double bond.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a common fragment. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas and see what they can break into.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, m/z 45. Let's see. What is 45? 45 could be a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Let's see:

- If the formula is C3H7O, what's the molecular weight? C=12, H=1, O=16. 3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. No, that's 59. So 59 is higher. Or maybe it's C2H5O2? Let's see: 2*12=24 +5=5, 2*16=32. 24+5=29 +32=61. No, that's 61. Not 45.

Wait, maybe not an oxygen-containing fragment. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2CH2O) something, but not sure. Alternatively, think about common ions. Let me think about what's 45:

45 is equal to 45 amu. So, I can think of several possibilities:

- The fragment could be (CH3)2O, which is 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16 =46. Close, but not 45.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is (CH3)CO, which is 45? Let's see: CH3CO is 12+1*3 + 12 +16 = 12+3=15 +12=27 +16=43. No, that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be a (CH2)2O group? Wait, (CH2)2O is 2*(12+2) +16= 24 +4 +16=44. No, that's 44.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O2 group? Let me calculate: 12 + 2 +32 =46. No, that's 46.

Wait, perhaps 45 is a CH3COOH fragment. No, that's too big. Or maybe a CH3CHO, which is 44. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHO group. Let me compute that: C=12, H= (2 +2 +1) =5, O=16. So 12 +5 +16=33. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be a result of losing a larger group. For example, in a molecule with a benzene ring, maybe a tosyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each option and see what they can fragment into.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) =72 +12 +32= 116. So m/z 116. But the fragment is at 45, which is less than half of that. So perhaps a fragment that's losing parts.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10) +16 =72+10=82 +16=98. So a fragment of 45 could be part of this.

Option C: C6H10O2. (6*12)+10 +32=72+10=82 +32=114. So a fragment of 45 would be part of this.

Option D: C6H12O. (6*12)+12 +16=72+12=84+16=100. So 45 is a possible fragment.

But how do I connect this to the other data?

Looking back at the FTIR: the strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl. So either a ketone, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H, like in a carboxylic acid, but maybe an alcohol.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl and another functional group, like an ester, which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage. Or a ketone and an alcohol.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like an enone. For example, something like cyclohexenone, but with other substituents.

Let me think about the possible structures. For example, a di-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an alcohol. Or perhaps an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR has carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650. Could that be two different carbonyl groups? Like a ketone and an ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would show a carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

So that would fit with the NMR showing vinyl (double bond) protons.

Now, the Mass Spec: what could give a 45 fragment? Let's think about common fragments. Perhaps a CH2=CHO group (like a ketene), but that would be 45? Wait, CH2=CHO has a formula of C2H3O. Molecular weight is 2*12 +3 +16=24+3+16=43. Not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH2)2O, which is 44. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps it's a methoxy group attached to something. Methoxy is OCH3, which is 31. Not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment with a ketone and some hydrogens. Or maybe a CH3CO group (43) but not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that's 31. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group with some substituents. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, the ester could break into a fragment. The ester group is O-C-O, but I'm not exactly sure how that would fragment.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecular formula can be determined by the degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate that for each option.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's compute for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2
C=6, H=12.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one degree: could be one ring or one double bond.

But wait, the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So DoU would be at least one. But for option A, DoU is 1. So perhaps a ring and a double bond would make it two degrees, but the calculation says only one. Hmm, that suggests maybe a ring but no double bond, but the NMR contradicts that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, let's recompute. For option A: 6 C, 12 H, 2 O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one degree. So that could be one ring and no double bonds, or a double bond and no ring, or a triple bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so that suggests a double bond. So that would need a DoU of 1 from the double bond. That would imply no rings, but perhaps the rest is satisfied with other structures.

Wait, this doesn't add up. If the DoU is 1, and the compound has a double bond (which is one DoU), then the structure can't have any rings or other double bonds. But let's hold that thought.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So same as A.

But our compound has a double bond (vinyl H), so at least one DoU. So all options have at least one DoU, except perhaps not. Wait, all options have at least one DoU.

Wait, but let's think back to the IR. If the 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, that's another DoU. So the compound has a carbonyl group (DoU 1) and a double bond (DoU 1). So total DoU 2.

Which options have DoU 2? Let's see:

Option B: DoU 2.

Option C: DoU 2.

Options A and D: DoU 1.

So that suggests the correct formula is either B or C.

So, the compound must have DoU 2. So possible formulas are B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, let's consider the functional groups. The IR shows O-H (broad peak) and a carbonyl. So if it's an alcohol (O-H) and a ketone or ester (carbonyl), then the formula would need both O and another O for the carbonyl. So the formula would have two O's. So that would be option C: C6H10O2.

But let me think again. For example, if the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. So for example, cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl (DoU 1 for the ring and 1 for the carbonyl, total 2). But I'm getting confused.

Wait, the carbonyl is a DoU of 1 (the double bond). Any rings would add another. So if the compound has a ring and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. So the formula must have DoU of 2, so either B or C.

If the formula is C6H10O (B), that's 6 C, 10 H, 1 O. So possible functional groups: an alcohol and a carbonyl? But that would require two O's. Unless it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require two O's, which isn't possible if the formula is C6H10O (only one O). So that's a problem.

Wait, wait: if the formula is C6H10O (B), that's only one O. So how can the compound have both an O-H group (like an alcohol) and a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), which would require two O's? That can't happen. So that formula (B) can't have both groups.

So that leaves option C: C6H10O2. That has two O's, so it can have both an O-H group (like an alcohol) and a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester). So that makes sense.

So, the FTIR data points to an O-H and a carbonyl. Hence, two O's, so formula C.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that the carbonyl is part of an ester group, which has two O's. So, for example, an ester would require two O's. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have two O's (COOH). But in that case, the O-H would be a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which fits the IR data.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester. For example, something like methyl something ester.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons. So perhaps the structure has an ester group and a double bond, maybe conjugated.

So, the formula C6H10O2 (option C) has two O's, which could be from an ester (O and O in the ester group). Also, the DoU is 2, so that would fit with a ring and a double bond, or a double bond and another DoU.

But how about the mass spec? The fragment at 45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. So what could fragment to 45?

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me see: 45 = 12*3 + 1* (45-36=9) → 3 carbons and 9 H's? 3 carbons would be 36, 9 H's is 9, plus O? Wait, 36 +9 =45. But that would be C3H9, which doesn't have O. Hmm.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment that includes an O. Let's see: 12 + (something) + 16 =45. 12 +16=28, so 45-28=17. 17 can be C (12) and H5 (5), so 12+5=17. So the fragment would be C2H5O. Wait, wait: C2H5O would be 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45? No, that's 24+5 is 29 +16 is 45. Yes! So a fragment with formula C2H5O.

So, what structures would break into a C2H5O group? Maybe an ester group, where the oxygen is part of the fragment. For example, in an ester, like R-O-CO-R', the ester could break into R-O- and CO-R' groups. Alternatively, perhaps during fragmentation, a part of the molecule breaks off as C2H5O.

Alternatively, the molecule might have a ketone and an ester group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: what if the parent ion is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114. When it fragments, it loses a part and forms a fragment at 45. So 114 -45 =69. 69 is another possible fragment. But I'm not sure what that would correspond to.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Hmm.

Another approach: think about the m/z 45. 45 could correspond to a CH2CH2O group (but that's 44). Or perhaps a CH3CH2O group, which is 45 (12*2 +5 +16=24 +5=29 +16=45). No, wait: CH2CH2O would imply (CH2CH2O): 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one oxygen. Wait, CH2CH2O is actually (CH2CH2O) but that's not a real functional group. Or perhaps CH3CH2O- is an ethoxy group, which is 45. So a fragment with an ethoxy group would have m/z 45.

So, if the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, the molecular ion could break into the ethoxy fragment. So for example, if the compound is ethyl something ester, like ethyl propionate or something. But in that case, the molecular formula would have more carbons than 6. Hmm.

Wait, our formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: if the ester group is O-CO-O, but in reality, esters are R-O-CO-R'.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. That would have the formula C7H10O2, which is more than our given options. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula again. C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. Let me see: 114. The possible fragments could be 45 and 69. 45 is C2H5O, as we thought earlier. 69 is 69 amu, which could be C3H7O2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses a larger fragment. For example, losing something like C4H8O2, which would leave a smaller fragment. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's a retro-aldol reaction or something else during fragmentation. Alternatively, the molecule could have a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group, and when it breaks, it loses a two-carbon fragment.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures based on the given data.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl), and another at 1650 (possibly a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring). The NMR has vinyl H's, so a double bond. The Mass Spec has a fragment at 45.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the possible structure could be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like cyclohexene with an ester group. Or maybe a substituted benzene with an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 cm^-1 peak could be an ester carbonyl. Esters typically have carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So if the compound is an ester, then the O-H would come from somewhere else, maybe an alcohol group elsewhere in the molecule.

But wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So in an ester, the O-H could be from an alcohol group, but esters themselves don't have O-H. So, if the compound is an ester and has an alcohol group, that would require two O's, which fits with option C (C6H10O2).

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would also require two O's.

So, the formula is likely C6H10O2.

Now, the mass spec: could a fragment of 45 be a result of losing a larger group from the molecule?

Suppose the molecule is something like phenyl propionate. Wait, phenyl proprionate would have the formula C9H10O2, which is more than our options. So not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with a methyl ester.

Wait, another angle: what if the fragment at 45 is a ketene? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a formate ester. No, that would be OCHO-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O.

Possible structures: could be an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate. Let's calculate the formula: cyclohexene is 6 carbons, the ester group adds O2, and the methyl adds another C. Wait, but that would be 7 C's, which is more than our option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. Let's see: cyclopentene (5 C), ester group (O2), and another substituent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group attached. Benzene is 6 C. If the ester is attached as a substituent, then the structure would be benzene ring + an ester group (O2). But that would be C6H5-O-CO-R, but that would require more than 6 C's.

Alternatively, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with an ester substituent. But again, the exact structure isn't clear.

But perhaps I don't need to know the exact structure. The key points are:

- Two O's (from the IR and the formula)
- Double bond (from NMR)
- Fragment at 45 (which seems to fit with an ethoxy group, which would require O in the fragment)

So, putting it all together: the IR suggests O-H and a carbonyl (two O's). The NMR has a double bond. The Mass Spec has a fragment at 45, which likely comes from an ethoxy group. So the compound must have an ethoxy group?

Wait, but if the formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is C2H5O (45), that suggests the molecule has an ethyl group attached with an O.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester where one part is ethyl. For example, ethyl something ester. But then the molecular formula would have to adjust.

Wait, let me think about the ester formula. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, if the ester is ethyl (R=ethyl, C2H5), then the other part (R') would have to be C4H5O. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the ester is methyl (R=CH3), then R' would have to be C5H9O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't an ester but a ketone with an O-H group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula and see which options have a degree of unsaturation that allows for a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So, that could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

So, for example, a benzene ring (which has three double bonds, but that's three DoU, which would require a higher DoU than 2. So, that's not possible. So, perhaps the structure isn't a benzene ring.

Alternatively, a cyclohexene ring (which is one ring, one double bond—so that's two DoU). Then, another carbonyl group (another DoU, making three). Wait, that's three, but our DoU is only two. So that can't be.

Wait, no, let me recalculate: the cyclohexene ring has a ring (DoU 1) and a double bond (DoU 1) — that's two DoU. Adding a carbonyl (another double bond) would make three DoU, but our formula only allows two. So that's a problem.

Hmm, maybe the structure isn't a ring but has two double bonds. For example, a diene and a carbonyl.

So, for option C, DoU 2. So, two double bonds (two DoU) and no rings.

So, for example, a molecule with a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. That would fit the IR data (two carbonyl peaks? Or maybe the 1650 is the conjugated double bond). But the presence of vinyl H's suggests a double bond, which would fit.

But how does this tie into the mass spec?

Another point: the IR's 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl (like an enone). So, a structure like CH2=CH-CO-O-R or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. But if it's not a benzene ring (due to the DoU constraint), perhaps a conjugated diene.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think differently.

The mass fragment at 45 suggests the presence of an ethoxy group or a similar fragment. So, perhaps the compound is an ester with an ethyl group.

Wait, for example, if the compound is ethyl something ester. Then, the ester group would be O-CO-O-Ethyl. So, the ethyl group would contribute to the fragment.

But the molecular formula is C6H10O2. So, if the ester is ethyl, then the R group of the ester would be C4H7O. Wait, ethyl is C2H5, so the other part would be R' where R'-COOEt is the ester. But the formula of the compound is C6H10O2. So, R'COOEt would be (R'COO)C2H5.

So, the R'COO would contribute 6-2=4 carbons. So R' is a 3-carbon group.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should move on.

So, the IR shows O-H and a carbonyl. The NMR shows a double bond. The Mass Spec has a fragment at 45.

Putting it all together, the most likely formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Data:
1. **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
2. **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid.
3. **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Likely corresponds to a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic C=C stretch.

### 1H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a CH₂=CH group) indicate the presence of a double bond.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45**: This suggests a fragment with the molecular formula **C₂H₅O** (45 amu). This could correspond to an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each option:
- **A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).
- **B (C₆H₁₀O)**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
- **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
- **D (C₆H₁₂O)**: DoU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).

The presence of a double bond (from the NMR data) and a carbonyl group (from the IR data) requires at least 2 degrees of unsaturation. This eliminates options **A** and **D**, leaving **B** and **C**.

### Functional Groups and Formula:
- The IR data indicates the presence of both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. This requires **two oxygen atoms**, which rules out option **B** (C₆H₁₀O, which has only one oxygen atom).
- Option **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)** satisfies all the data:
  - It has two oxygen atoms, consistent with the O-H and carbonyl groups.
  - The degrees of unsaturation (2) match the double bond and carbonyl group.
  - The Mass Spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 can be explained by the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).

### Conclusion:
The chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

ANSWER: C
