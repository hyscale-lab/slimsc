Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about exoplanets and their orbital periods using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves a little, and that causes the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each with a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The first planet causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some equation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

I remember the formula K = (v) = (28.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_earth) * (P/(year))^(−1/3) * (M_* + M_p / M_earth)^(−2/3) )

But since the stars are the same mass as the Sun and the planets are similar to Neptune, and assuming they're not too massive compared to the star (so M_* >> M_p), the denominator becomes roughly the star's mass to the 2/3 power. But since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, that term is the same for both. Also, the planet masses are similar, so M_p sin i would be the same for both, assuming the inclination i is similar (which it probably is since we detected the planets).

So if M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, then the only varying factors are the period and the semi-major axis. Wait, but in the formula, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_* sin i) * (something about the period and orbital distance).

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:
K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:
K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But both stars have the same mass, and the planets' masses are similar, so M_p is the same, and sin i is similar (assuming both are edge-on, which they probably are for detection). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because the rest of the terms are same.

Wait, no, let me see. Let me rearrange the formula. Since K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So if K is larger, then P is smaller. Because if K increases, (1/P)^(1/3) increases, so P must decrease. So planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5 milliangstroms), so its period is shorter? Or wait, no. Because the question is how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K. So the period is inversely proportional to K^(3). Because K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, let me think. Let me write the relation again. K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Since K1 and K2 are both observed, and M_p and M_* are same for both, then K1/K2 = (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let's think again. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant (since M_p and M_* are same for both).

Then, K1/K2 = (C/P1^(1/3)) / (C/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, to find P2/P1, we can cube both sides. So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, no, let me rearrange this correctly.

From K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3), we can write K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3), where k is the same constant for both.

So, K1 / K2 = [ (k / P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (k / P2^(1/3) ) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for P2/P1:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, wait. If (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but K2 is larger than K1, so K1/K2 is less than 1. So P2 will be less than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So if P2 is shorter than P1, then P2/P1 will be less than 1. So the ratio is less than 1, so options A or D.

Given that K2 is larger than K1, so K1/K2 is 5 /7 ≈ 0.714.

So (5/7)^3 = (approx 0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (0.364) → so P2 is 0.364 times the period of P1. Thus, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, which means the period is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning it's about 0.36 times, so the period is shorter.

Wait, but the question is "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's asking P2 / P1. If P2 is smaller, then the ratio is less than 1.

So the calculation gives (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So the answer is about 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get the formula wrong. Because sometimes the RV method depends on the cube of the period. Because the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, right? So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1.

Alternatively, using the formula:

K = [ (2πG) / (c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since e is zero for circular orbits, it's even simpler.

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K doubles, P^(1/3) halves, so P is 1/8th.

In this case, K2 is (7/5) times K1. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

So P2^(1/3) = (5/7) P1^(1/3)

Cube both sides: P2 = (5/7)^3 P1 = 125/343 P1 ≈ 0.364 P1

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we can relate the periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \approx 0.714 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (0.714)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is:

**Answer: A**
