Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a weak acid-strong base titration. The pH at different points will depend on the reaction between them.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (volume1 × concentration1) / (volume1 + volume2). That would be (20 × 0.05) / 40 = 1 / 40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted solution is 0.0125 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L × 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Then you dilute to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so I made a mistake earlier. The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M, not 0.0125. Hmm, okay, that's an important step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

The question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol.

At this point, let's calculate the pH. Since 25% of the acid has been neutralized, there's 75% of the acetic acid left, and 25% has been converted to acetate ions.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.

So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 ×10^-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, close to 4.735).

Now, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.735 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.258, which rounds to about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) in solution. The solution now contains this conjugate base, which will hydrolyze in water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

The moles of acetate ion at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the equivalence point volume (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], so Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approx 3.288e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's calculate that:

log(3.288) ≈ 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. Then pH is 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516, which is about 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the first option.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait! Wait a second. Oh, no, wait. Wait, when we dilute the solution, adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acid, the initial concentration is 0.025 M. Then, when titrated, the equivalence point occurs after adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, making the total volume 50 cm³.

But wait, the acetate concentration is 0.001 mol in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M. So Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me re-calculate the Kb approach.

Wait, Kb = 5.405e-10. So for the reaction, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The approximation is that x is small compared to 0.02. So x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. So [OH-] is 3.29e-6, pOH is -log(3.29e-6) → let's compute that accurately:

log(3.29) is about 0.516. So log(3.29e-6) is 5.516, so pOH is 5.516. pH is 14 - 5.516 = 8.484, which is approximately 8.48. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, but my calculation got 8.48. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe I should be more precise with the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact quadratic equation would be better. Let me set up the equation:

Let x be [OH^-].

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So approximation is valid. So x ≈ sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6.

pH would be 14 - (pOH of 5.484) → 8.516, which is about 8.52, so the earlier calculation holds.

So the equivalence pH is approximately 8.52.

Now, looking back to the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → matches our results.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → no.

Option C: 4.73; 7.00 → no.

Wait, but what about the 25% titration? Did I get that right?

At 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So yes, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025, and the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001.

So after reaction, moles of HA are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of A- are 0.00025.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) → pKa is 4.735 → pH = 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.258, which is approximately 4.26. So option A's first pH is correct.

So, according to this, the correct answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but let me double-check the equivalence point calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, but the solution volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol divided by 0.05 L is indeed 0.02 M.

Wait, another thought: when you calculate the pH at the equivalence point, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer anymore, but rather a solution of the sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic, as I concluded.

So I think the calculations hold. Therefore, the answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume has been reached. The equivalence point occurs when all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH required for equivalence are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed for equivalence is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of this volume (2.5 cm³) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.258 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ions} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ions in water produces \(\text{OH}^-\). The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \([\text{A}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
