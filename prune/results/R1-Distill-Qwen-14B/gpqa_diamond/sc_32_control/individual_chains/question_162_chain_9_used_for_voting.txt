Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about some of the concepts here, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2D metric, right? Because it's involving dx and dy only. So the space we're dealing with is 2-dimensional. 

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that's a term from hyperbolic geometry. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly a pseudosphere's area would be in this context.

Let me think about what a pseudosphere is. I think it's an infinite surface in hyperbolic space, kind of like a horn shape. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So in the context of general relativity, it's a 2-dimensional manifold with a specific metric.

But wait, the metric here is given in terms of x and y. So perhaps this is a coordinate system on a 2D space. The metric's form looks a bit like something I've seen before. Let me write it down: ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I notice that the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). So 4 is like a radius squared, 2 squared. So maybe this metric is defined for points where x² + y² < 4. Because if x² + y² equals 4, the denominator becomes zero, which would make ds² singular. So the space is only defined inside the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but pseudosphere is a different kind of surface. Am I mixing up the concepts here? Or is this metric representing a pseudosphere in some way?

Alternatively, maybe this is a metric in 2D that's conformally flat, since it's written as a function times (dx² + dy²). The function here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

In 2D, the area element in such a metric would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, integrated over the coordinates. Wait, but the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. Since it's conformally flat, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. 

So let's compute that. The metric tensor g has components:
g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_yy = same as g_xx
g_xy = 0, and g_yx=0.

So determinant is g_xx * g_yy = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, no, the area element for a 2D metric is sqrt(det g) dx dy, right? So sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))² ) where r² is x²+y².

So sqrt((32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2) = 32/(4 - r²). 

So the area element dA is 32/(4 - r²) dx dy. Now, perhaps it's easier to switch to polar coordinates, since x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So substituting, dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Now, the total area would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2 (since the denominator becomes zero at r=2). So:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The integral over θ is straightforward: 2π.

So Area = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr] / (4 - r²) = ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 (-du/2)] / u.

Hmm, 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u.

The integral of du/u is ln |u|. So:

32 * (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, wait, let me write it out:

Integral = 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the expression becomes:

32*(-1/2)* ( -∞ - ln4 ) → 32*(1/2)*( ∞ + ln4 )

Wait, that can't be right. Because ∫ from 0 to 2 would change the limits. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the substitution is u=4 - r², so when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral I did is correct. Let's compute it:

The integral becomes 32*(-1/2) [ (ln 0) - ln4 ) ]

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So:

32*(-1/2) * ( (-infty) - ln4 )

This becomes 32*(1/2) * (infty + ln4 )

Which is (32/2) * infty → 16 * infinity = infinity.

So the integral diverges. That means the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, but I'm not sure if this metric is actually representing a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Alternatively, maybe the metric isn't representing a sphere or pseudosphere but a different kind of surface. Or perhaps the metric describes a space with finite area.

Wait, but the calculation led to an infinite area. Looking at the options, option D is +infinite.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

The area element in polar coordinates is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The integral over θ is 2π.

So the radial integral is ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me try integrating without substitution. Let me write it as:

∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²).

Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) ] / u = (32 * (-1/2)) ∫ du/u = (-16) ∫ du/u.

Which is (-16) ln|u| + C.

Evaluating from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2):

So [ (-16) ln(0) ) ] - [ (-16) ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so:

-16*(-infinity) - ( -16*ln4 )

Which is positive infinity plus a finite term, so the integral diverges to infinity.

So yes, the area is infinite. So the answer is D.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the space is only defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a circular region of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), which is interpreted as the total area of the space described by this metric.

To compute the area, the area element in 2D is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which gives \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} du}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{u}\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is infinite.

The correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
