Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that plx (in parsecs) is approximately 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's like, how many stars you'd expect to find when you look at a range of parallaxes. I think this ties into the concept of volume in space because as you move further out, the volume increases, and so does the number of stars, but maybe not in a straightforward way.

Wait, wait. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. So, the number density of stars is constant throughout the space. That means the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

Oh right, when you consider a spherical shell at a certain distance from us, the volume of that shell depends on the radius. The volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance), and dr is the thickness of the shell. So, for a given volume element, the number of stars would be proportional to this volume.

But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d. So, if I have a small range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, I can relate that to a range in distance. Let me see, since d = 1/plx, a small change in plx (dplx) would correspond to a small change in distance.

Let me think about how the distance changes with plx. If d = 1/plx, then the differential distance dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. So, dd = (d(plx))/d d) * dplx. Wait, actually, wait. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = (d/d plx)(1/plx) ) = -1/(plx^2) dplx. Oh, right, so the change in distance is inversely related to the square of the parallax times the change in parallax.

But I'm interested in the number of stars in a small range of plx. So, for a given plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd. Since the number of stars is density times volume, and the density is uniform, let's say n (number per volume). So, number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But I need to express this in terms of plx. So, substituting d = 1/plx, and dd in terms of dplx. Let's see:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Wait, the negative sign indicates direction, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe we can ignore it. So:

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) → n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that would give N proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's the number of stars per unit dplx. Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the substitution.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx. Let's think in terms of parallax. The volume element in terms of parallax would involve the derivative between distance and parallax.

Because the volume element in terms of plx would relate to how much distance changes with plx. So, for a given plx, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in distance.

So, the volume element is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the number of stars in that range is number density (n) times the volume. So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) * dplx. But the question is asking about how the number changes with plx. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would suggest the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx means closer stars, but as you go closer, the volume shell (for a given plx range) is smaller. Wait, no, because plx is 1/d. So, higher plx (smaller d) would mean the stars are closer, so a unit change in plx higher would correspond to a small distance, but the volume element is 4π d² dd. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about when plx is small. Small plx means large d. So, that's distant stars. The volume element for a small change in plx (dplx) would be larger because the volume of the shell increases with d², but the change in d (dd) is inversely proportional to plx squared.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. The number should be proportional to the volume between those two distances.

The distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. The next distance is d + dd, where dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx. So the volume element is 4π (d^2) dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx, we get:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Which simplifies to:

Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx) → but since we're considering positive dplx, perhaps the negative is just for the direction, so the magnitude is 4π / plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * 4π d^2 dd → n * 4π (1/plx^2) ( 1/(plx^2) dplx ). So, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

So, if I'm looking at the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx), it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean as plx increases (which is, the star is closer, since plx = 1/d), the number of stars per unit plx would drop off as 1/plx^4. But wait, if plx increases a lot, like when plx is 1, then 1/plx^4 is 1, but when plx is 0.5, 1/(0.5)^4 is 16. So, for smaller plx (larger distance), the number of stars per unit plx increases. That makes sense because the volume elements are larger, so more stars would be found in a given plx range when looking at larger distances.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, the number per unit plx is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. If the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4, then as plx increases (so d decreases), the number per unit plx drops. Which makes sense because the closer stars lie in a smaller range of plx, so each unit of plx would contain fewer stars.

Wait, but wait, another approach. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness in distance (dd). So, if we express dd in terms of dplx, then we can write the number per unit plx.

But I think my earlier conclusion was correct, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a given range of parallax \( d\text{plx} \), the corresponding range of distance \( dd \) is related by \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume and the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( d\text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means that as parallax increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases more steeply.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
