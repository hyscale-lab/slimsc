Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and spectroscopy.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break it down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. When dibrominated adamantane is treated with a base, I think it's an elimination reaction. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would probably lose two equivalents of HBr upon dehydrohalogenation. So maybe it's forming an allene or a diene?

Wait, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2) undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But here it's 1,3-dibromo. So elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3, making a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's a 1,3-elimination, forming a triple bond. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, with each carbon connected to three others. So the 1 and 3 positions are probably not adjacent. Oh wait, maybe they're on opposite sides. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a diene?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination would form a triple bond. Because sometimes, dehydrohalogenation of 1,3-dihalides can form an alkyne. Wait, but with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, you usually form a double bond. But if the two Br are on non-adjacent carbons, maybe elimination leads to a triple bond or a conjugated diene.

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage of carbons. The 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent positions in such a way that eliminating two Br atoms would form a triple bond.

Wait, no, wait. Let's imagine the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings connected in a chair-like structure. So, each carbon is part of three rings. The 1 and 3 positions might be two carbons that are two apart in some ring. But when Br is on each, KOH (a strong base) would abstract a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur, leading to a diene.

But wait, let's think about the product. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows an absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests that product 1 is a ketone or an ester or something with a carbonyl group. Wait, but KOH is a base and not oxidizing. How does that happen?

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with KOH, more likely elimination. Wait, but if it's elimination, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Hmm. Another possibility is that elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but then perhaps additional oxidation occurs. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because elimination forms double bonds, not carbonyls.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement or some kind of keto-enol tautomerism? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably two equivalent protons, maybe a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a set of equivalent or similar protons, perhaps from a cyclohexane ring or similar. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, considering the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹, which aligns with a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹). So product 1 is a ketone. So how are we getting a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Oh wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination typically forms alkenes or alkynes, not ketones. Unless there's some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial compound is treated with KOH in a substitution-elimination reaction. So perhaps the two Br atoms are eliminated as Br⁻, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but given the structure, maybe it's more than a single elimination.

Wait, but how does that form a ketone? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that usually involves amines. Not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with a strong base, but under KOH, it's more elimination. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes double elimination (two dehydrohalogenation steps), perhaps forming an allene or a diene. But then, how does it form a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. But enols are more acidic than ketones, which would require a base to deprotonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to elimination of Br⁻ and formation of a conjugated base. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product structure, given the NMR and IR.

The product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's high up, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. Let's say that's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Then the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a cyclohexane ring, like in adamantane, which has a lot of equivalent protons. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH₂ group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl as well.

So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like 1,3-diketone, but in adamantane. Wait, but how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound undergoes an elimination to form a new carbonyl group. Oh! If we have two vicinal bromides, perhaps a double elimination would produce a carbonyl. Wait, but that doesn't fit because elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls.

Wait, another thought: Maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution. If KOH is present, perhaps the Br is replaced by OH groups. Then, under basic conditions, could two OH groups form a carbonyl? That seems unlikely without oxidation.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what's product 1. Considering the IR at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. The NMR shows a peak around 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a sharp singlet. That could be a methylene group next to a carbonyl, perhaps in a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: Adamantane has a very rigid structure. So when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, treating with KOH might cause elimination of HBr twice, forming a bridge with a double bond. But again, how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms a conjugated diene, and then under the influence of KOH, which might have some oxidizing properties. But I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent. Wait, but maybe the structure of adamantane allows for some kind of keto-enol tautomerism after elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, so 1,3-diketone adamantane. But how? Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not seeing the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If both Br groups are replaced by OH, but that would form a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe it's a peroxide formation? No, KOH doesn't typically form peroxides.

Another possibility: Maybe the KOH acts as a base, causing a rearrangement. For instance, if a hydride is shifted, leading to carbonyl formation.

Wait, perhaps when the two Br atoms are eliminated, a conjugated diene is formed, but somehow under basic conditions, an enol is formed, which tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, which would explain the IR. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the formation of a carbonyl via two elimination steps. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination of two HBr molecules, perhaps forms a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not very stable, so maybe they form a carbonyl.

Wait, if it's a bridgehead, perhaps the structure is such that the two adjacent carbons (originally with Br) lose H and Br to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the two elimination steps lead to the formation of a triple bond, but that wouldn't produce a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the next step and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid catalyst. So, heating a ketone with a Lewis acid catalyst might lead to some kind of ring-opening or condensation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe not. Wait, maybe product 1 is treated in a way to form an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen condensation or some kind of aldol condensation. But without another carbonyl compound, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide, but product 1 is a ketone, not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves the base-catalyzed dehydration of a 1,2-diol (pinacol) to form a ketone. But product 1 is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is treated with a Lewis acid to form an enol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a aldol addition.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ketone, and heating with Al isopropoxide might induce a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) facilitates the formation of an enol, which then rearranges. Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 could be the result of a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a diene and a dienophile, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide in a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring. I don't think product 1 has an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, Al isopropoxide could be involved in the formation of a more complex cyclic structure, perhaps a ring expansion.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So perhaps product3 is a dialdehyde or diketone.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded protons are usually near electronegative atoms or in an environment with lower electron density, like near carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product3, the most deshielded H would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's an aldehyde proton (though those are usually around 9-10 ppm), but product 3's NMR doesn't have such a peak mentioned.

Wait, but the problem states that the solvent is deuterated, and we should exclude exchanged protons. So maybe the most deshielded H is in a carbonyl-adjacent position, like a CH₂ near a ketone.

But wait, after ozonolysis, product3 would have carbonyl groups. So let's think about the structure.

Let me try to outline the possible structures step by step.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product1 with KOH. Product1 is a ketone.

Assuming that product1 is a ketone, perhaps having two carbonyl groups. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms. If each elimination forms a carbonyl, perhaps product1 is a diketone.

Wait, another approach: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps two adjacent C-Br bonds undergo elimination. Each elimination removes a Br and an adjacent H, forming a double bond. But with two Brs, maybe two eliminations happen, leading to a conjugated diene.

But if that's the case, product1 would be a diene, but the IR doesn't support that. Unless the diene is part of a ring where conjugation leads to a carbonyl, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br⁻ and formation of a double bond. If this happens twice, perhaps we get a diene. But then, product1 would be a diene, which would show C=C stretching in the IR, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, conflicting info. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, there's a possibility that the first reaction forms a carbonyl via elimination and some kind of keto-enol tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution, but that would form a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the NMR of product1. The 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet) suggests a deshielded CH₂ group, possibly adjacent to an electronegative group like O. But if product1 is a ketone, that adjacent CH₂ could be part of a cyclohexane ring next to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product1 is 1-adamantanone. Let's think: 1-adamantanone would have a ketone group at one position, and the rest of the structure being adamantane.

So 1-adamantanone would have the carbonyl at position 1. Then, what would the NMR look like? The CH₂ next to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.5 ppm or so. Wait, but in product1, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's not 1-adamantanone. Maybe it's a diketone, like 1,3-diketone. Let's imagine a structure where two carbonyls are at positions 1 and 3 in the adamantane structure. Then, the H's adjacent to these would be deshielded.

Wait, but how would the NMR look? The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for two H. Maybe those are the H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so the carbons adjacent to the ketone would each have two H's. Wait, no, because adamantane is a diamondoid, each CH group is part of three rings.

Hmm, perhaps the CH₂ group at 4.79 is part of a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is about where an OCH₂ group would appear. For example, in an ether or ester. But product1's IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an ester. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile, so ester formation seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, and the 4.79 ppm is due to some other group, like an isolated CH₂ near a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product1 is a bicyclic ketone with a bridge, leading to a CH₂ group that's deshielded. For example, in some bridged bicyclic compounds, the bridgehead protons can be deshielded and appear around 2-3 ppm. But 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to an epoxide ring, but then the IR should show a peak around 1200 cm⁻¹ for the C-O-C stretch. But the IR given is 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let's try moving forward.

Assuming product1 is a ketone, product2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid and is often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but without an aromatic ring, that's not applicable. Alternatively, it could be used in the formation of enol ethers or other enolates.

Wait, perhaps product1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an enol. Enols can undergo various reactions, such as Michael additions or aldol condensations.

Wait, but product2 is then ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product2 must have a double bond.

So perhaps product2 is an alkene. How?

Wait, perhaps product1 is a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an enone (a conjugated dienone), which would have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

But wait, product2 is formed by heating product1 with Al isopropoxide. So maybe product2 is a diene or an enone.

Alternatively, perhaps product1 is a ketone, and product2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would cleave.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks the bond and forms carbonyl groups. For example, an alkene R1CH₂CH₂R2 would become R1CHO and R2CHO upon ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with Zn in H₂O), but in this case, the workup is with dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant. Wait, actually, ozonolysis with dimethyl sulfide as a workup typically cleaves the ozonides into carbonyl groups without further oxidation. So if product2 has a double bond, product3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So the structure of product3 would depend on where the double bonds were in product2.

Now, going back. Product1 is a ketone. When product1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a dehydration reaction to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). Enones have conjugated double bonds between the carbonyl and another carbon. Ozonolysis of an enone would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

But wait, if product2 is an enone, ozonolysis would break the double bond, and product3 would have two additional carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the structure. Suppose product1 is a ketone with some substituents. Product2 would then form an enone, and product3 would have two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps product2 is a diene, and ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on this. Let me think of the possible answer.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product3.

In the NMR, the most deshielded would likely be a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's assume product3 has a carbonyl group, and the proton is adjacent to it.

The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons. For example, a proton next to a CH₂ group would couple with those two, but if those are split into a triplet, etc.

Wait, but let's think of a possible structure. Suppose product3 has a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. But that's a diester or diketone. Alternatively, if product3 is a dialdehyde, with O=CH–CH₂–CHO, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe product3 is a diketone with a chain. Suppose the structure is (O=C)-(CH₂)n-C=O. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be the CH₂ groups.

In that case, each CH₂ group would have neighboring Hs. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group next to two other CH₂ groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another approach: The coupling pattern arises from neighboring protons. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl, so it's a CH₂ group attached to carbonyl. If that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, which is in turn next to another CH₂, each coupling with each other.

But perhaps it's a geminal coupling or vicinal.

Wait, actually, in such a case, the central CH₂ group would be coupled with two different sets of protons. For example, if the structure is:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O

Then, the middle CH₂ would have two neighboring CH₂ groups on either side. Each of those CH₂ groups has two Hs. So the middle H would couple with each of the neighboring groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that would be a triplet for each coupling, so the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the adjacent groups are each split into a triplet, the overall splitting might be more complex.

Wait, but perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group that's next to two different CH₂ groups. So each H on that CH₂ couples with two Hs from each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if each adjacent group has two Hs, then each coupling would lead to a triplet. If there are two different coupling constants (from each adjacent group), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the two adjacent groups are equivalent, the splitting might be a quartet (each coupling with two Hs, leading to n+1 =3, so triplet), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. If the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then each CH₂ is next to another CH₂. The central CH₂ would be between two CH₂ groups. So each H on the central CH₂ is next to two Hs on each adjacent CH₂.

But wait, in that case, each H on the central CH₂ would have coupling with the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. So each H would be a doublet of doublets, because each coupling (left and right) would split the peak.

Wait, no. Let's say the central CH₂ is CH₂A. It's next to CH₂B on the left and CH₂C on the right. Each CH₂ has two Hs. So each H in CH₂A would couple with each H in CH₂B (two Hs) and each H in CH₂C (another two Hs). But wait, if CH₂A is in between B and C, each H in A would see four Hs in total (two from B and two from C). But that's not possible because each H in A is only coupled to adjacent Hs.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For vicinal coupling (J coupling between adjacent carbons), each H in CH₂A would couple with the Hs in CH₂B and CH₂C. But in reality, each H in A is coupled with each H in B and each H in C. But for a CH₂ group, the two Hs are equivalent, so the splitting would be determined by the number of neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a simpler case. If a CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each H in the first CH₂ will couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So each H in the first CH₂ would be a triplet (n = 2, so n+1 =3). So the splitting would be a triplet.

But if the CH₂ is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups (like CH₂A between CH₂B and CH₂C), then each H in CH₂A would couple with two Hs from B and two from C. But since B and C are different environments (different coupling constants), each H in A would be a doublet of doublets, or perhaps a triplet of triplets if each coupling is with two Hs.

Wait, but in reality, if each adjacent CH₂ has two Hs, and if the coupling constants are different, each H in A would split into (2+1)*(2+1)=9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of a scenario where the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group that is next to a CH group. Or perhaps, the CH₂ is next to a CH that has two neighboring Hs.

Wait, another approach: In product3, after ozonolysis, the structure could be a diketone with a chain. For example, O=C-R-CH₂-C=O. If R is a CH₂ group, then the CH₂ in the middle would have two neighboring CH₂ groups on either side. Each of those would lead to splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The middle CH₂ would have CH₂ groups on both sides. Each H in that middle CH₂ would be coupled with the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. But each coupling would have a different J value, leading to a more complex splitting.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering that the options are limited, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets (Option B).

Alternatively, let's think about the position of the most deshielded H. It would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so it's a CH₂ group. If that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, which is next to another CH₂ group, then the central CH₂ would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH, perhaps the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

But honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Based on the options, I think the most plausible answer is a triplet of triplets (Option B).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH, leading to a product (product 1) with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The singlet at 4.79 ppm suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely a carbonyl. The other peaks correspond to protons in a rigid adamantane framework.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely a ketone, possibly 1-adamantanone or a related diketone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This likely induces a rearrangement or elimination, forming product 2.  
   - Given the subsequent ozonolysis step, product 2 likely contains a double bond, as ozonolysis specifically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring protons.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group and is part of a CH₂ group. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each with two protons.  
   - Each hydrogen in the central CH₂ group couples with the two protons on each adjacent CH₂ group. Since the coupling constants from the two adjacent groups are different, the splitting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

**Answer: B**
