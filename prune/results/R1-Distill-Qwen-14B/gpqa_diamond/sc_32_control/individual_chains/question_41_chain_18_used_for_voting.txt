Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's read the question again. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure about how the movement of the medium affects the speed of light inside it. I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n (since c is given as 1 here).

But the glass is moving. So does that change the speed as observed in the lab? I'm trying to recall if there's a formula that combines the medium's velocity and the light's velocity within it. Oh wait, I think this might relate to the concept of relative velocity, but light's speed is tricky because it's a constant in all inertial frames according to Einstein's theory.

Wait, but the glass is a material medium, not an inertial frame of reference for the light itself. So maybe I should think about how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of the light.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the addition of velocities from special relativity, but I'm not sure if that applies here since the medium is moving and the light is within the medium.

Wait, let me think differently. If the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, and the light inside the glass is moving at speed v_light = 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion, then the observer would see the light's speed as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass, right? But wait, that's probably only correct if the velocities are much smaller than c, but in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Oh, but wait, the speed of light in a medium isn't necessarily c, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed might approach c.

Wait, but the speed of light in a moving medium is a bit of a paradox because in different frames, the speed of light is still c. Oh wait, but wait, that's in vacuum. When the medium is moving, the light's speed within the medium is different. So, maybe the answer is more straightforward.

Wait, the problem says the light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction.

In the frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. But from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the speed of the light?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the velocity transformation between frames. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Then, the speed of the light in the glass (as observed in the lab) would be the speed of the light in the glass's frame plus the speed of the glass, but considering relativity of velocities.

Wait, no, velocity addition in special relativity isn't as simple as adding. The formula for adding velocities is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is u = (1/n), since it's moving through the glass at that speed. But wait, no, because the speed of light in the glass is 1/n (since c=1), but the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the light's speed should still be c, but that's only in a vacuum. Wait, no, the problem is about light in the glass, which is a medium. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the light's speed in the glass is 1/n, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at (1/n + v), but that can't be right because if v is significant, the speed might exceed c, which isn't possible.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, but when the medium is moving, does the observed speed add up? Maybe not, because the speed of light in the medium is independent of the medium's motion.

Wait, perhaps the answer is simply 1/n, but let me check the options. Option B is 1, but that's only if the glass were a vacuum, which it's not. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, perhaps the observer in the lab would see the light moving at v_light = (v_glass + v_medium) ?

No, that's not quite right. Let me think about frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u = 1/n. So using the Lorentz velocity transformation, the velocity in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v_glass) / (1 + (u * v_glass)/c²). Wait, but since c is 1, the equation becomes u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v).

So substituting u = 1/n, we get u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ) = ( (1 + n*v) ) / (n + v ) * (1/n) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me write that again. Using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v_glass) / (1 + (u * v_glass)/c² )

But since c=1, it's:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v )

Here, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So,

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: 1 + n*v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n*v)/(n + v) * (1) [because (1/n) + v multiplied by n gives 1 + n*v, as I did.]

Wait, so u' is (1 + n v) / (n + v). But wait, that's the same as option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, is that the case? But wait, let's think about units. If n is the refractive index, which is unitless, and v is in units of velocity (like same as c=1, which is dimensionless as well). So (1 + n v) has the same units as (n v), which would be (unitless * velocity unit) but since n is unitless, and v is a fraction of c, perhaps the units are consistent.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula gives u' as (u + v) / (1 + uv), which for small velocities (v <<1 and u <<1), approximates to u + v, but in reality, it's different.

So according to this, the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab would be (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Looking back at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches this.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial assumption was that the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n. But is that correct? Because in the glass's frame, the speed of light is indeed 1/n. But when the glass is moving, the lab frame sees a different velocity.

So using the velocity addition, the correct formula is (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v ) = (1 + n v) / (n + v). Which is option A.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the refractive index affects the velocity. For example, when a medium is moving, the refractive index might change. But the problem states that the glass's index of refraction is n, so perhaps that's a given, and we don't have to consider any changes due to motion.

So, I think the correct answer is option A. But I'm a little unsure because I might have made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in the lab frame, the light's speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me plug in some numbers to see if it makes sense. Suppose the glass is stationary (v=0), then the speed should be 1/n. Plugging v=0 into option A, we get (1 +0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which is correct.

Another test: if v is very small compared to 1, then the denominator (n + v) is approximately n, and the numerator is 1 +n v. So option A becomes (1 +n v)/n = 1/n + v, which makes sense as a linear approximation. So that seems correct.

Another test: if n=1 (vacuum), the speed should be c=1. Plugging n=1, v= any value, option A becomes (1 + v)/(1 +v) =1, which is correct. So that fits.

So all the test cases seem to confirm that option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light beam propagates through the glass with a refractive index \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (in the glass's frame):**  
   In the frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in a vacuum).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**  
   To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:  
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]  
   Simplifying by multiplying numerator and denominator by \( n \):  
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

3. **Verification with Special Cases:**  
   - If \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the given formula.  
   - If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light is \( 1 \), which is consistent with the formula.  
   - For small \( v \) (where \( v \ll 1 \)), the formula approximates to \( \frac{1}{n} + v \), which aligns with a linear velocity addition.

4. **Matching the Options:**  
   The derived formula \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \) matches **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
