Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think this through. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium in a 1:1 ratio. So when they form a complex, the EDTA is in a deprotonated form that can bind the metal. The stability constant, K, represents how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so the metal is more tightly bound.

Wait, the formula for the stability constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means the concentration of the complex is equal to the sum of the free calcium ions and the EDTA ions, but actually, in this case, since all the calcium is complexed (because K is so large), the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, does that mean that all the calcium and EDTA are in the form of the complex? Because at stoichiometric proportions, I think that the complex is formed, and the free ions are negligible.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. So maybe the complex dissociates a bit, so there's some free Ca²+ and EDTA ions. But since K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That would mean that the concentration of free Ca²+ is very low.

So let's think in terms of the K expression. K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Since the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is so large, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the initial concentrations. Suppose I have a solution where Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Then, the total concentration of calcium would be the sum of free Ca²+ and the Ca in the complex. Similarly for EDTA. But since the complex is formed, and K is large, the free Ca²+ and free EDTA would be very small.

But since the problem is about the concentration of calcium ions, which includes both the free Ca²+ and those bound in the complex. Wait, no, the question specifically asks for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So that would include the free Ca²+ plus those in the complex. Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the total calcium would be 0.02 M, because each complex has one Ca²+ ion. So [Ca²+]total = [Ca²+]free + [Ca-EDTA complex] * 1 (since it's 1:1). But wait, no, because the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ is x, so total Ca is x + 0.02? That doesn't make sense because when the complex forms, the Ca is part of the complex. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify: The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total calcium concentration (free + complexed) is 0.02 M. Because each complex has one Ca²+ ion. So, [Ca²+]total = [Ca²+]free + [Ca-EDTA complex] = x + 0.02? No, that can't be right because the complex is 0.02 M, which is the concentration of the complex, so the Ca in the complex is 0.02 M. So the free Ca²+ plus the complexed Ca equals 0.02 M? Or wait, no, the complex is the total Ca. Hmm.

Wait, wait a second. The 0.02 M is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that implies that the total calcium concentration is 0.02 M. So the sum of free Ca²+ and the complexed Ca is 0.02 M. But in reality, when the complex is formed, the free Ca²+ is very low because K is so large. So [Ca²+] ≈ x, and the complex is 0.02 M, so x is much smaller than 0.02. So the total [Ca²+] is x + 0.02 ≈ 0.02 M.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The solution also has some free Ca²+ and some free EDTA^4- ions. So, the K expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since K is 5e10, which is very large, the denominator must be very small, so [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] must be small compared to [Ca-EDTA].

But what's the relationship between [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-]?

Wait, when EDTA forms complexes, it's usually in a 1:1 ratio. So the initial situation is that you have Ca-EDTA at 0.02 M. Let me assume that the solution also contains some excess EDTA, but no, wait, the problem states that it's a stoichiometric solution. So the moles of Ca and EDTA are equal. So maybe all the Ca is complexed, and all the EDTA is complexed, but that can't be, because the complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution is made by dissolving Ca-EDTA, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

But with K = 5e10, which is a large K, meaning the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both low.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, then the initial assumption is that the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both approximately sqrt(K/[Ca-EDTA])?

Wait, because K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Assuming that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, because in the dissociation, each releases one of each ion.

So K = [Ca-EDTA]/(x^2) => x^2 = [Ca-EDTA]/K.

So x = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA]/K )

Wait, but [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, so x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10 )

Calculating that: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, wait 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, so [Ca²+] would be 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. Because in this case, I'm assuming that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and that the complex concentration is 0.02 M. So the K expression becomes 0.02/(x^2) =5e10, so x^2=0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13. So x=sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7.

Yes, that seems right. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates minimally due to the large stability constant, the concentrations of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions are assumed to be equal, denoted as \(x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
