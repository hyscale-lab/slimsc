Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Right, when a molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, what momentum should that photon have to move the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for rotation and vibration would be the ground state. So the molecule is in its ground state, and it absorbs a photon that causes it to transition to the next state. But what's the next state? Because in rotation and vibration, the energy states are quantized.

Wait, the problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So it's the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this refers to vibration, rotation, or both. Oh, the model is the rotation-vibration model, so the energy levels account for both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is sometimes called the rotation-vibration model, where the bond can stretch a bit, so the rotational energy levels are considered along with the vibrational ones. So the energy levels are given by a combination of vibrational and rotational energies.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be written as E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. For the fundamental state, E_vibrational is at its lowest (v=0) and E_rotational is also at the lowest (J=0). So the next state would either involve increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational quantum number, or both.

Wait, but the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So maybe it's a transition where the molecule goes to the next possible state with the least energy increase. Which would imply moving from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and their spacing is smaller than the vibrational spacing. So the energy required for a rotational transition is usually lower than for a vibrational transition. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length can change, so the rotational energy might be affected by vibration.

Wait, but the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, w=4e14 rad/s. So maybe the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's a vibrational transition or a rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first excited vibrational state, v=1, with J=0. Or maybe J=1 and v=0. Which of these has a lower energy difference?

Wait, the energy of a vibrational transition is given by ΔE_vibrational = (v' + 1/2) h w - (v + 1/2) h w. For the fundamental state, v=0, so ΔE_vib = (1/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) = h w. So the photon would have energy h w.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rotational = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by h/(8π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, no, wait. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I), but I have to think in terms of the proper formula.

Wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I as B = h/(8π² c I). Wait, no, perhaps I should just use the formula E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. But more accurately, B is h/(8π² I c), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. So first, I need to calculate the reduced mass μ.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the total mass is 22 amu. The reduced mass μ is (Mx My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert the reduced mass into kilograms because momentum is in SI units. Oh, wait, but the photon's momentum is involved, which relates to its energy. Hmm, but maybe I can find the energy difference first.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy E by E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon needed for the transition, I can find p.

So the energy difference between the initial state and the next state will determine the photon's energy. So the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Which of these transitions requires less energy? Let me calculate both.

First, the vibrational transition: ΔE_vibrational = h w. Given w =4e14 rad/s, so ΔE_vib = h w.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

Alternatively, the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy for J=0 is E_0 = 0, and for J=1, it's E_1 = B *1*(1+1) = 2B.

So the energy difference is 2B. What's B? B is the rotational constant, which is given by B = h/(8 π² I c). Wait, I might be mixing up the rotational energy expression.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). Because E_J = ( ħ² J (J+1) ) / (2 I ), and ħ = h/(2π), so E_J = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to calculate the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) but maybe I should compute the energy difference in joules.

So I need to compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r². But r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. μ is in kg.

Wait, the reduced mass μ is (Mx My)/(Mx + My) in amu. But 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is E = (h²/(8 π² I)) * [1*(1+1) - 0] = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So let's compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46 ≈ 8 *9.87 *1.208e-46 ≈ 8 * 11.923e-46 ≈ 9.538e-45.

So E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (9.538e-45) * 2. Let's do the division: 4.39e-67 / 9.538e-45 ≈ 4.39 /9.538 * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J. Multiply by 2 gives 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but that's for the rotational transition. The vibrational transition energy is about 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy (9.2e-23 J is less than 2.65e-19 J). So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that causes a rotational transition because it's lower in energy. But wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state with the least energy increase.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The energy difference for going from J=0 to J=1 is lower than from v=0 to v=1, so the photon required for the rotational transition would be of lower energy.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. So which transition is allowed? Are both allowed? Or is the molecule in a state where it can only undergo certain transitions?

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rules for rotational transitions are ΔJ = ±1. But for the vibration, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the selection rules are similar, but the energy differences are more complex because of the coupling between rotation and vibration. Hmm, but maybe the problem is simplified and considers transitions only in one mode at a time.

But regardless, the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy difference is the smallest, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy would be E = ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J (from previous calculation).

Wait, but the calculation I did for E_rot might be incorrect. Let me double-check.

Let me recalculate E_rot.

E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * [J (J+1) - J' (J'+1)] where J' is the initial state, J'' is the final state.

In this case, J' =0, J''=1. So E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * (2 - 0) = 2 * (h²/(8 π² I)).

So let's compute that.

Compute h²/(8 π² I):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * (1.208e-46 kg·m²) ≈ 8 *9.8696 *1.208e-46 ≈ 8 * 11.923e-46 ≈ 9.538e-45.

So h²/(8 π² I) = 4.39e-67 / 9.538e-45 ≈ 4.39 /9.538 * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by 2: 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, how does this compare to the vibrational transition? The vibrational ΔE is much higher, as we saw: 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the photon's momentum is determined by the rotational transition.

So the photon's momentum p is given by E = p c, since photons have energy E = pc. So p = E/c.

E is 9.2e-23 J.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is 3.07e-31 N·s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options are all larger than that. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I confused the rotational energy levels. Another approach: perhaps the question is about a transition from the ground state to a state with the next highest energy, which could be a vibrational transition. But the energy required for that is higher, but maybe that's the correct approach.

Wait, but the question says, what photon momentum should cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.

But I'm getting a p around 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. But the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Wait, that's correct. So E_rot = (h^2/(8 π² I c)) * 2? Wait, no, earlier I think I might have messed up, perhaps I should use the rotational energy formula correctly.

Wait, the formula for E_J is (h^2 / (8 π² I)) * J (J+1) / (2), or perhaps it's E_J = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

Wait, let me check the exact formula for rotational energy levels.

In quantum mechanics, the rotational energy levels are given by:

E_J = ( ħ² J (J +1) ) / (2 I )

where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/(2π)).

So substituting ħ = h/(2π), we get:

E_J = ( (h²/(4 π²) ) J (J+1) ) / (2 I )

Which simplifies to E_J = h² J (J+1) / (8 π² I )

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = E_1 - E_0 = (h² / (8 π² I )) (2 - 0) = 2 h²/(8 π² I ) = h²/(4 π² I )

Wait, so E_rot = h²/(4 π² I )

Wait, earlier I had E_rot = 2 * (h²/(8 π² I )), which would be h²/(4 π² I ), same as this.

So yes, that's correct.

So E_rot = h²/(4 π² I )

Let me compute h²/(4 π² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

4 π² I = 4 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46 ≈ 4 *9.8696 *1.208e-46 ≈ 4 * 11.923e-46 ≈ 47.692e-46 ≈ 4.7692e-45.

So h²/(4 π² I ) = 4.39e-67 / 4.7692e-45 ≈ (4.39 /4.7692) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 *1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So the same as before, 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. So the momentum p = E / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm, my calculation gives ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in selecting the transition. Maybe the correct transition isn't the rotational one but a vibrational one.

If the photon causes a vibrational transition, then the energy ΔE is h w.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns. But that's about a sixth of my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both rotational and vibrational energies change. But that would require a photon with energy equal to the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, which would be higher than either. So that's unlikely since the problem says the next state with the lowest energy increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be a vibrational one, despite the higher energy, but that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition would require less energy. So why are the options not matching my calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy but only vibrational. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the question might be about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first rotational state (J=1). In that case, the energy difference would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions.

Wait, no, because the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=0, J=1, or v=1, J=0, whichever has the smaller energy difference.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the correct photon energy is the one for the rotational transition, which would give p ≈3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

So I must be doing something wrong. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used the reduced mass in a different way. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / 22 amu = 40 /22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μ r² =3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Then, E_rot = h²/(4 π² I ) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 pi² *1.208e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

Denominator:4 pi² *1.208e-46 =4 *9.8696 *1.208e-46≈4 *11.92e-46≈47.68e-46 =4.768e-45.

4.39e-67 /4.768e-45 = approx 9.2e-23 J. So correct.

p =9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) =3.066e-31 kg·m/s =3.066e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the model used in the problem is different. Maybe it's the rigid rotor model where I is fixed, and the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = h/(8 pi² I c). Wait, but that would give B in cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers and then find the energy.

Wait, B in cm^-1 is given by B = h/(8 pi² I c), where c is the speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, let's compute B.

c=3e8 m/s =3e10 cm/s.

I =1.208e-46 kg·m². Let's convert I to g·cm². 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m =100 cm.

I = 1.208e-46 kg·m² = 1.208e-46 * 1000 g * (100 cm)^2 = 1.208e-46 * 1000 * 10^4 g·cm² =1.208e-46 * 1e8 =1.208e-38 g·cm².

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, B is given by h/(8 pi² I c), with c in cm/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 J·s.

But J is kg·m²/s². So h is 6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

So I in kg·m² is 1.208e-46 kg·m².

So B = h/(8 pi² I c) = (6.626e-34) / (8 * pi² * 1.208e-46 *3e10 )

Compute denominator:8 * pi² ≈ 79.577, 79.577 * 1.208e-46 ≈9.617e-45, multiplied by 3e10 gives 9.617e-45 *3e10=2.885e-34.

So B ≈6.626e-34 / 2.885e-34 ≈2.3. So B≈2.3 cm^-1.

Wait, B is 2.3 cm^-1. So the rotational energy for J=1 is E_1 = B*1*(1+1) =4.6 cm^-1. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, the energy difference for the rotational transition is 4.6 cm^-1, but to convert that to joules, since 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J/cm. So 4.6 cm^-1 * 1.986e-23 J/cm ≈9.13e-23 J. Which matches the earlier calculation. So same result.

So p=9.13e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.04e-31 Ns. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the vibrational transition. Let's see what that would be.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c= 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg·m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of 8.83e-28. Hmm, but why? Did I miss a factor of 2?

Wait, perhaps the vibrational transition requires a photon with energy equal to the difference between v=0 and v=1, which is (3/2 h w - 1/2 h w )= h w. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the rotational transition but I made a mistake in the moment of inertia or somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but in the calculation, I used 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of w (angular frequency of vibration), but I'm not sure how that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled as a harmonic oscillator where the energy spacing is h w, and the photon's energy is h w. So the momentum p= h w / c.

Wait, with w=4e14 rad/s, p=h w/(c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Close to option D, which is 1.4e-28. But again, not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotational and vibrational changes happen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the vibrational transition in terms of the moment of inertia, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), which would be a vibrational transition. Then the photon's energy would be h w, and the momentum is p = h w /c.

Which gives the same 8.83e-28 Ns, which is close to option D, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute p again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c.

c=3e8 m/s.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.835e-28 kg·m/s =8.835e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of 8.8e-28. So perhaps the correct calculation is a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the vibrational transition but the rotational transition, but the given options don't match that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the answer in terms of the vibrational transition, but I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to a state with J=1 and v=0. So rotational transition.

Which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns. But no option is that close.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy. Let me recalculate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the moment of inertia I = (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2) * r², which is correct, but perhaps I should consider it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia in u·Å². Because sometimes in these problems, people use atomic mass units and angstroms.

Let me try that.

1 u = 1 amu.

r =2 Å.

I= μ r² = (20 *2)/(20+2) u * (2 Å)^2.

Wait, but when using these units, you have to convert them into kg·m².

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute I in terms of u·Å², and then convert to kg·m².

1 u =1.6605e-27 kg.

1 Å =1e-10 m.

So I= μ r² = (40/22) u * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that:

(40/22) * (4e-20 m²) * 1.6605e-27 kg/u.

Wait, wait, no: I is μ r².

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 u.

r=2 Å=2e-10 m.

So μ r² = (40/22 u) * (2e-10 m)^2.

But u is 1.6605e-27 kg, so:

μ r² = (40/22) *1.6605e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute:

40/22 ≈1.81818.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.02e-27 kg.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.208e-46 kg·m². Which is what I had before.

So no error there.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum of the photon in a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the vibrational transition energy, but I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34.

w=4e14.

E =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. But the options do not include this. The closest is option D:1.4e-28, option A:1.9e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated as p = h / (λ), and λ = c /f, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is considered as E = (1/2) h w, but that wouldn't make sense for a photon.

Wait, maybe in the problem, the energy is calculated as (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w. So that's correct. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2? No, because that would require a higher energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum p = h / (λ), and λ is determined from the energy E = h f = h c / λ.

But in that case, E = h w, so λ = h w / E? No, E = h w = h c / λ → λ = h c / (h w) )= c/w.

So p = h/(λ) = h w / c. Which is the same as before. So same result.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the options don't have the right value. But perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the transition.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a vibrational state, but the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1, which is a rotational transition. But the photon's momentum in that case is 3e-31 Ns, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer options are expecting the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, which is ~8.8e-28, but the options don't have that. The closest is option D:1.4e-28. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational photon's momentum.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E / c =2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s →8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28 → about 1/5 of my result.

Option B:2.3e-27 → about 26 times larger.

Option C:1.1e-27 → about 12.5 times larger.

Option D:1.4e-28 → about 6.3 times smaller.

So none match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon.

Wait, perhaps the vibrational energy difference is ½ h w? No, because the ground state is v=0, so the first excited state is v=1, and the energy difference is (v+1/2) h w - (v+1/2) h w →h w.

No, that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the molecule goes from J=0 to J=2, which would require a higher energy, but that's unlikely since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=1 and v=0 to v=1 simultaneously. But that would require more energy than either transition alone, so it's not the minimal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in atomic mass units but not converting units correctly. Let me try.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia I is being calculated in atomic mass units and angstroms, but not converted to SI units. Let me try that.

I = μ r².

μ = 40/22 u ≈1.818 u.

r=2 Å.

So I =1.818 u * (2 Å)^2 =1.818 u *4 Å² =7.272 u·Å².

Then, 1 u·Å² = (1.6605e-27 kg) * (1e-10 m)^2 =1.6605e-47 kg·m².

So I =7.272 *1.6605e-47 = approx 1.208e-46 kg·m². Same as before. So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is modeling the molecule as a rigid rotor and considers only rotational transitions, but I'm not seeing where the discrepancy is.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the possible mistake in the problem statement. Oh wait, the problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So the next state would be the one with the least energy, which is the rotational transition. But the calculation for that gives a p that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy levels. Let me double-check.

E_J = (h² / (8 π² I )) * J (J+1).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant B in terms of the moment of inertia. B = h/(8 π² I c) where c is the speed of light.

Wait, no, B is the rotational constant in terms of energy, but the standard formula is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹. How is B calculated?

Yes, B = h/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, let me compute B in cm⁻¹.

c=3e10 cm/s.

I=1.208e-46 kg·m² =1.208e-46 kg * (100 cm)^2 =1.208e-46 *1e4 kg·cm² =1.208e-42 kg·cm².

Wait, no, perhaps better to convert I into g·cm².

1 kg =1000 g, 1 m=100 cm.

I=1.208e-46 kg·m² =1.208e-46 *1000 g * (100 cm)^2 =1.208e-46 *1e8 g·cm² =1.208e-38 g·cm².

Then, B = h/(8 π² I c).

h=6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

I=1.208e-38 g·cm² =1.208e-41 kg·cm².

Wait, perhaps I should compute I in kg·cm².

Wait, 1 m=100 cm, so 1 m²=1e4 cm².

So I=1.208e-46 kg·m² =1.208e-46 *1e4 kg·cm² =1.208e-42 kg·cm².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 pi² *1.208e-42 *3e10 )

Compute denominator:8 pi² ≈79.577, 79.577 *1.208e-42 ≈9.617e-41, multiplied by 3e10 gives 2.885e-30.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.885e-30 ≈2.3e-4 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that can't be right. 2.3e-4 cm⁻¹ is 0.0023 cm⁻¹, which is a very small rotational constant. So E_J = B J (J+1) = 0.0023 cm⁻¹ * J (J+1). For J=1, E=0.0046 cm⁻¹.

Convert that to joules: 1 cm⁻¹ =1.986e-23 J. So E=0.0046 *1.986e-23 ≈9.13e-26 J.

Wait, wait, that's different from the previous calculation of 9.2e-23 J. Wait, that's a factor of 100 difference. What did I do wrong?

Ah, I think I messed up the unit conversion again. Because when I calculated I in kg·cm², I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's do it again carefully.

I=1.208e-46 kg·m².

1 m² =10000 cm².

So 1 m² =1e4 cm².

So I=1.208e-46 kg·m² =1.208e-46 *1e4 kg·cm² =1.208e-42 kg·cm².

Then, B = h/(8 pi² I c).

h=6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

I=1.208e-42 kg·cm² =1.208e-42 *1e-2 kg·m² =1.208e-44 kg·m². No, wait, cm² to m² is 1e-4. So 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm² =1e-4 m².

So I=1.208e-42 kg·cm² =1.208e-42 *1e-4 kg·m² =1.208e-46 kg·m². Which is correct.

Wait, no. I think I did it right the first time. So I =1.208e-46 kg·m².

So B = (6.626e-34 kg·m²/s) / (8 pi² *1.208e-46 kg·m² *3e10 cm/s).

Wait, but c is in cm/s, which is 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, 8 pi² ≈78.96.

So denominator:78.96 *1.208e-46 *3e10 =78.96 *3e10 *1.208e-46.

Compute 78.96 *3 =236.88.

236.88e10 *1.208e-46 →236.88 *1.208 = approx 286.1 →286.1e(10-46) =2.861e-35.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.861e-35 →approx 23.1 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that's different. So B=23.1 cm⁻¹.

So E_J = B J (J+1) → for J=1, E=23.1 *2=46.2 cm⁻¹.

Convert to joules: 46.2 cm⁻¹ *1.986e-23 J/cm⁻¹ =9.13e-22 J.

So the energy difference is 9.13e-22 J.

Then, the photon's momentum p =E/c=9.13e-22 /3e8≈3.04e-30 kg·m/s=3.04e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is correct, and the rotational energy is 46.2 cm⁻¹, which is about 9e-22 J. So p=3e-30 Ns.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would be E=23.1 *6=138.6 cm⁻¹ → 2.71e-21 J → p=9.03e-23 Ns.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

The problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either v=1, J=0 or J=0, v=0, J=1. The energy required for the rotational transition is much less than the vibrational one, so the photon should correspond to the rotational transition.

But the calculated p for the rotational transition is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but another aspect. Or perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=1 and v=1, which would require even more energy, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in a different way. Let me compute the rotational energy using the vibrational frequency given. But I'm not sure how that connects.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(2π c) * sqrt( (v+1)(v+2) - v(v+1) ), but that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which in the non-rigid rotor model would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But I'm not sure about the exact form of the energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the state where both J and v are excited, but that's probably not the case.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The correct transition is the rotational one, giving p≈3e-31 Ns, but the options don't have this. Alternatively, the correct approach is the vibrational transition, giving p≈8.8e-28 Ns, which is closest to option D:1.4e-28 but not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, perhaps the vibrational energy is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w. So that's correct. So the photon's energy is h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. So p=2.65e-19/3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in meters, but in the moment of inertia I used it correctly. Yes, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the reduced mass. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. μ= (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.818 amu. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = E_photon / c, where E_photon = (h^2)/(8 π² I) → which would be the rotational energy.

Wait, E_rot = h²/(8 π² I) *2 → for J=1.

So p = E_rot / c = (h²/(8 π² I * c)) *2.

Compute h²/(8 π² I *c) → (6.626e-34)^2/(8 *9.8696 *1.208e-46 *3e8).

Compute denominator:8 *9.8696=78.9568. 78.9568 *1.208e-46 =9.538e-45. 9.538e-45 *3e8=2.861e-36.

h²=4.39e-67.

So 4.39e-67 /2.861e-36≈1.535e-31.

Multiply by 2:3.07e-31 kg·m/s=3.07e-31 Ns.

Again, not matching any option.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require p=8.8e-28 Ns. But the option closest is D:1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of that. I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the vibrational photon's momentum.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c =2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s=8.83e-28 kg·m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

So the closest option is A:1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to a state with J=2, which would require more energy, but that would make the photon's momentum even larger, which is not matching any option except B.

But I'm not sure. I think I've spent too much time on this and have to make a choice based on the available options.

Looking back, the rotational transition gives a much smaller p than any option, so the correct approach must be the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns. None of the options match, but the closest is option D:1.4e-28, which is about 6.3 times smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem refers to the transition from J=0 to J=1 with v=1, but that would be a combination of both transitions. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the moment of inertia as (Mx + My) * r². But that's incorrect because the correct formula is μ r².

Wait, perhaps someone made a mistake in the question and the correct option is not provided. But I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h / (lambda), and lambda is calculated using the vibrational frequency. So lambda = c / (v), where v is the frequency.

Wait, but v = w/(2 pi). Because w is angular frequency.

So v =4e14 rad/s / (2 pi) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

Then, lambda = c / v =3e8 m/s /6.366e13 Hz ≈4.71e-6 m=4710 angstroms.

p = h / lambda =6.626e-34 J·s /4.71e-6 m ≈1.405e-28 kg·m/s=1.405e-28 Ns.

Ah! Now, this matches option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me re-examine.

Yes, when a photon is absorbed, its wavelength is lambda = c / f, where f is the frequency. The frequency is v = w/(2 pi) =4e14/(2 pi) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So lambda ≈4.71e-6 m.

p = h / lambda =6.626e-34 /4.71e-6 ≈1.405e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

So that's the correct approach. I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the frequency correctly. The photon's momentum is given by p = h / lambda = h f / c = (h w/(2 pi)) / c.

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

w=4e14 rad/s.

f= w/(2 pi) =4e14 /6.283≈6.366e13 Hz.

lambda = c/f =3e8 /6.366e13 ≈4.71e-6 m.

p= h/lambda =6.626e-34 /4.71e-6=1.405e-28 kg·m/s.

So the correct answer is option D:1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Molar masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency of vibration**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Step 1: Reduced Mass
The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
\[
I = \mu r^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Rotational Energy Transition
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \cdot J (J+1)
\]
For the transition \( J=0 \to J=1 \), the energy difference is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \cdot (2 - 0) = \frac{2 h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
\]
Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{2 (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.208 \times 10^{-46})}
\]
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]
The corresponding photon momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
\]
This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, so the rotational transition is not the correct choice.

### Step 4: Vibrational Energy Transition
The vibrational energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]
The corresponding photon momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]
This value is also not directly listed among the options.

### Step 5: Revisiting the Vibrational Transition
The angular frequency \( \omega \) is related to the frequency \( f \) by:
\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2 \pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
\]
The wavelength \( \lambda \) is:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{6.366 \times 10^{13}} \approx 4.71 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]
The photon momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.71 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]
This matches **Option D: \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is based on the vibrational transition, where the photon momentum is calculated using the wavelength derived from the frequency of vibration. The rotational transition is ruled out due to its much smaller momentum, which does not match any of the provided options.

**Answer: D**
