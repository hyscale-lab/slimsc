Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, right? The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. 

The problem says that photometric observations would show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into our line of sight. But this setup can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. The star isn't covered by spots in this hypothetical, so the exoplanet's effect would be just the normal transit method.

So I need to find R_pl divided by R_star, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius, such that the dip in brightness is the same as caused by the spots.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't the same as a planet transit, because the spots are cooler and when they rotate into view, the total brightness decreases. But when the spots are on the far side, the brightness increases again, but I think the net effect is a dip when spots are facing us.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the star's brightness would be lower when spots are visible because they are cooler. So the variation would cause a dip in the light curve when spots are present in the hemisphere facing us. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view, causing the brightness to dip periodically.

But the problem says that the brightness variation from the spots can resemble an exoplanet's transit. So the question is, how big a planet would cause a dip in brightness of the same amplitude as the spots do.

So I need to model both scenarios and find the planet radius that gives the same delta F (brightness change).

But wait, the star's brightness without spots is being compared to the situation where a planet transits it, causing a dip. So I should calculate the fractional change in flux due to the spots and equate that to the fractional change due to a planet transit.

Wait, but the star's spots are spread over a hemisphere. Let me think: The star has a radius R, so its surface area is 4πR². The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. One hemisphere is 2πR², so the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² area.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) ) = σTeff^4 R² * (4πR² / 4π) ? Wait, no. Wait, the flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

But the flux we receive (apparent brightness) is F = L / (4π d²), but when calculating the fractional change, maybe d cancels out. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the total flux from the star and then the change when spots are present.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux from the star when the spots are present and compare it to the flux when the spots are not present. Then, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and the flux decreases, which causes a dip. The amplitude of this dip would be the difference between the normal flux and the spotted flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spots are fully visible, so the flux is at its lowest.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so only one hemisphere has spots. So as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. The flux from the star would then have a certain dip, which is the same as the dip caused by a planet blocking some light.

Wait, but the star is emitting flux based on its temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the total flux from the star decreases.

So the change in flux would be the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Let me think about the flux without spots: F0 = σ T^4 * (4π R²) / (4π) ) = σ T^4 R². Wait, no. Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says the power (luminosity) L = 4π R² σ T^4. The flux at distance d is F = L/(4π d²) = (σ R² T^4) / d². But for the purpose of relative changes, maybe the distance d will cancel out.

But when the spots are present, a fraction of the star's surface emits less flux. The spots cover 20% of a hemisphere, so the area covered is A_spots = 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4 π R².

The spots have a temperature T_spots = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are in view is F_spotted = (flux from unspotted areas) + (flux from spots).

Flux from unspotted areas: The area of the unspotted part of the hemisphere is (hemisphere area) - A_spots = 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R². But wait, the star's total surface is 4π R², but only half (2π R²) is the hemisphere we're considering. So the unspotted part of that hemisphere is 2π R² * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 π R².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spots are in view.

The flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere is (1.6 π R²) * σ T^4. The flux from the spots is (0.4 π R²) * σ (T-1000)^4.

Wait, no, wait. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are on the near side is:

F = (Area of unspotted region) * σ T^4 + (Area of spotted region) * σ (T-1000)^4.

The area of the unspotted region is 2π R² * 0.8 (since 20% is spotted), so 1.6 π R².

The spotted area is 0.4 π R².

So F_spotted = 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

The normal flux without any spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4, because the entire surface is emitting at 6000 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's total surface is 4 π R². But in the scenario with spots, only one hemisphere (2 π R²) is spotted. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux comes from the spotted hemisphere and the far hemisphere (unspotted). So the total flux is:

F_spotted = [ (2 π R² - A_spots) * σ (6000)^4 ] + [ A_spots * σ (5000)^4 ] + [ (2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ].

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently.

The star's total surface is 4 π R². When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2 π R², with 20% (0.2) of that being spots. So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest (1.6 π R²) is unspotted.

So the flux from the near side is (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The flux from the far side, which is also 2 π R², is all at 6000 K, so 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So total flux when spots are visible is:

F_spotted = [1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ] + [2 π R² σ (6000)^4 ]

= (1.6 + 2) π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

The normal flux (without spots) is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the difference is:

ΔF = F0 - F_spotted.

F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = 3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

ΔF = (4 - 3.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) .

Wait, no. Wait, F_spotted is F0 minus the spots' contribution? Or no. Because F_spotted is when spots are visible, so the flux is less than F0. So the dip ΔF is F0 - F_spotted.

So:

ΔF = F0 - F_spotted = [4 π R² σ (6000)^4] - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (4 -3.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

Wait, no. Wait:

No, because F_spotted is (unspotted near side) + (spotted near side) + (far side). So, F_spotted = [1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 ] + [2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 ]

= (1.6 + 2) π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So F0 is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the dip is F0 - F_spotted = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4 - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (4 -3.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4).

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ].

Wait, wait. Let me compute that:

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14).

But F0 is 4 π R² σ (6e3)^4 = 4 π R² σ (1.296e15) = 4 * π R² σ * 1.296e15.

Wait, but the dip is (0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14)).

Expressed as a fraction of F0, which is 4 π R² σ (1.296e15):

ΔF/F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14)] / [4 π R² σ (1.296e15)] 

Simplify:

= (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

0.4 /4 = 0.1.

6.71e14 / 1.296e15 = 6.71 / 129.6 ≈ 0.05176.

So 0.1 * 0.05176 ≈ 0.005176.

So ΔF/F0 ≈ 0.005176, or about 0.5176% dip.

Wait, that's a very small dip. So the fractional change in brightness is about 0.5%.

Now, the exoplanet transit would cause a dip equal to (R_planet/R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2 (since only the disk matters). So the fractional change is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits, the area blocked is π R_p^2, so the dip is (π R_p^2) / (π R_star^2) ) = (R_p/R_star)^2.

So the fractional change is (R_p/R_star)^2 = delta F.

Wait, but in the case of the spot, the dip is ~0.5176% as a fraction. So the planet's dip would need to match that. So (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.005176.

Taking the square root: R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.005176) ≈ 0.07196, which is approximately 0.072.

Looking at the options, option B is ~0.07, and option C is ~0.11.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the step where I calculated 6000^4 minus 5000^4. Let me double-check.

6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Yes, that's correct.

So 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divided by (4 * 1.296e15) )= 5.184e15.

So 2.684e14 / 5.184e15 = 0.05176.

Multiply by 0.4, wait no, in the previous step, the dip is 0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14).

Wait, no, I think I did that correctly before. Because the dip is 0.4 π R² σ (6.71e14), and F0 is 4 π R² σ (1.296e15). So when I take the ratio, the π R² σ terms cancel out.

So 0.4 * 6.71e14 / [4 * 1.296e15 ] = (0.4 * 6.71) / (4 * 1296 ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15) )= (0.4 * 6.71) / (4 * 1.296 * 10) ) because 1e14 / 1e15 = 0.1.

So 0.4 * 6.71 = 2.684.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296 * 10 = 51.84.

So 2.684 / 51.84 ≈ 0.0517.

So delta F over F0 is 0.0517, or about 5.17%. Wait, wait, no, earlier calculation said 0.5176% but now I'm getting 5.17%. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Let me re-express: 

ΔF = 0.4 * π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

F0 =4 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So ΔF / F0 is (0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 * 6000^4 )

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) *1e12 ] / (4 * 6^4 *1e12 )

= (0.4 (1296 - 625 )) / (4 * 1296 )

= (0.4 * 671) / (5184 )

= 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.0517.

So ~5.17% dip. Oh, I see, I must have miscalculated earlier. So the fractional dip is about 5.17%.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the initial approach I thought the dip was 0.5%, but now it's 5%, which is a big difference. I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the flux when the spots are present.

Wait, the star is emitting normally, but when the spots are on the near side, the flux from that hemisphere is a mix of spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, the star's surface is 4 π R². When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2 π R², of which 20% is spots. So the unspotted part is 1.6 π R², and the spotted part is 0.4 π R².

So the flux from the near side (spotted hemisphere) is (1.6 π R²) * σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T-1000)^4.

The far side is 2 π R², all at T, so 2 π R² σ T^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is:

F_spotted = (1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T-1000)^4 ) + (2 π R² σ T^4 )

= 3.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T-1000)^4.

The total flux without spots is F0 =4 π R² σ T^4.

So the dip ΔF is F0 - F_spotted = (4 -3.6) π R² σ T^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (T-1000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ T^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (T-1000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ [ T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ].

So ΔF / F0 = [0.4 (T^4 - (T-1000)^4) ] / (4 T^4 )

= [ 0.4 ( (6000^4 -5000^4 )) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14, so 6000^4 -5000^4=6.71e14.

So ΔF/F0 = (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

= (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 )

= 2.684 / 5184 ≈ 0.00517.

That's 0.517%, which is about 0.5% dip.

Wait, now I'm getting back to the initial 0.5% figure. So what's correct here?

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the calculation of F_spotted. Let me re-express F_spotted.

F_spotted = (unspotted near area) * sigma T^4 + (spotted near area)*sigma (T-1000)^4 + (far area) sigma T^4.

The near area is 2 pi R^2, of which 20% is spotted. So unspotted near area is 0.8*2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2. Spotted near area is 0.2 *2 pi R^2=0.4 pi R^2.

Far area is 2 pi R^2.

So F_spotted = (1.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4 ) + (0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4 ) + (2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 )

So, F_spotted = (1.6 + 2) pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4.

= 3.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4.

F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So ΔF = F0 - F_spotted = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 - [3.6 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4 ]

= (4-3.6) pi R^2 sigma T^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (T-1000)^4.

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma [ T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ].

So ΔF / F0 = [0.4 (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] / (4 T^4 )

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 * 6.71e14 ) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

= (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 )

= approx 0.00517 or 0.517% dip.

So that's the dip the star's brightness undergoes when the spots are in view.

Now, the exoplanet would cause a dip equal to (R_p / R_star )^2.

So we set (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.00517.

Taking square root: R_p/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.00517 ) ≈ 0.0719, which is approximately 0.072.

Looking at the options, option B is ~0.07.

So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and equate it to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is partially covered by dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total flux from the star without spots is:
     \[
     F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4) + (2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4)
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 3.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4
     \]

3. **Fractional Flux Change**:
   - The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_0}
     \]
     Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left(3.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4\right)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4\right)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Canceling terms:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4\right)}{4 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}, \, T_{\text{spots}}^4 = 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \)
   - \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14} \)
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{4 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{2.684 \times 10^{14}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.00517 \, \text{(or ~0.517\%)}.
     \]

5. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The fractional flux change caused by a planet transit is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta F}{F_0}} = \sqrt{0.00517} \approx 0.0719.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.072 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
