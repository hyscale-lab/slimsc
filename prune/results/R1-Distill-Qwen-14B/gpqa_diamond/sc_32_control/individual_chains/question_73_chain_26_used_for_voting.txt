Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, first, I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So subtracting them: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But wait, we can't just take that as the relative speed. Dividing by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (1 - 0.3c²/c² )= 1-0.3=0.7. So v_rel would be (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. Oh, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c: their gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. No. Wait, gamma is (1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))). So for v=0.6c: sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma=1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = gamma * m_total * c². Wait, the mass is 2m. So E1=1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 * mc² * 2? Wait, no. Wait, 2m multiplied by 1.25 gives 2.5 m. So E1=2.5 mc².

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, it's gamma_1 * (2m) c². Gamma_1 is 1.25. So E1=1.25 *2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, that's not right. Because 2m multiplied by 1.25 is 2.5m, but the energy is then 2.5m c². Oh right, because E=gamma * m c^2. So, for 2m object, E is gamma * 2m c². So yes, E1=1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Now for the second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma_2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approximately 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 = 3.4641, so E2≈3.4641 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc² approximately. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and D says E=5 mc². So C's energy is 5.96, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the calculations correctly. Let me recalculate E1 and E2.

First astronaut:
v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36.
Gamma_1 = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.
E1 = gamma_1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut:
v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25.
Gamma_2 = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1.154700538.
E2 = gamma_2 *3m c² = (1.154700538)*3 ≈3.464101615 mc².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈5.9641 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So for the energy part, the correct option is C, which has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the total energy of the system." In relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic, but in the options, the E seems to be just the sum of the energies. So that's correct.

So putting it together: the relative speed is ~0.14c, and the total energy is ~5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5 m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641 m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 m c^2 + 3.4641 m c^2 \approx 5.9641 m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96 m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96 m c^2\)**.
