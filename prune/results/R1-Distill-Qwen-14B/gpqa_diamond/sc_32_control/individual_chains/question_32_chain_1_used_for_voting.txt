Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The options are A to D, each with different GeV values.

First, I need to figure out the mass of the nucleus X. Lithium with 3 neutrons... Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ⁶Li.

The next step is to find the rest mass of this nucleus. I remember that the rest mass energy of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. But wait, considering binding energy and all, I might need to look up the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it using the sum of protons and neutrons' masses.

Wait, I think the rest mass of a nucleus is calculated by taking the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But without exact data, maybe I should just use the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the proton mass as a standard.

Wait, let me think. Lithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Similarly, neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let me calculate the total mass.

Each proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², so 3 protons would be 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. Each neutron is about 939.565 MeV, so 3 neutrons would be 3 * 939.565 = let's see, 3*939 is 2817, and 3*0.565 is 1.695, so total 2818.695 MeV. Adding protons and neutrons: 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. But that's the sum of individual nucleon masses. The actual mass of the nucleus is less because of binding energy. Oh wait, but wait, the mass of the nucleus is the sum minus the mass defect, which is the binding energy. So the actual rest mass would be lower than the sum of individual nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Lithium-6. Let me recall that the atomic mass of ⁶Li is approximately 6.013225 u. Wait, yes, I remember that from some tables. 1 u (atomic mass unit) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that to energy units.

So ⁶Li's mass is 6.013225 u. Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u to get the rest mass energy in MeV. Let's compute that:

6.013225 * 931.5 = ?

Let me calculate: 6 * 931.5 = 5589, 0.013225 *931.5 ≈ 12.323. So total is approximately 5589 +12.323 = 5601.323 MeV. Wait, but wait, wait, that's using the mass in atomic mass units. But in reality, when considering a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of protons and neutrons because of the binding energy. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of the protons, neutrons, and electrons, minus the binding energy. But wait, the electrons may not contribute much. Hmm.

Wait, wait a second. For a nucleus, the mass is actually given by the mass of the atom minus the electrons' mass. But for a neutral atom, each Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. So perhaps I should calculate the atomic mass of ⁶Li and then subtract the mass of the electrons to get the nuclear mass.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to look up the exact rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of the ⁶Li nucleus in terms of u and then convert to GeV.

Another approach: the rest mass energy M of the nucleus is the mass of the nucleus times c squared. So I'll get M in GeV.

So let's proceed with the exact value. The exact mass of ⁶Li is 6.013225 u. Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.013225 u = 6.013225 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 *931.5 = 5589. 0.013225 *931.5≈12.323. So 5589 +12.323=5601.323 MeV. Which is approximately 5.601323 GeV.

Wait, that's the rest mass energy. So M = 5.601323 GeV/c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.013225 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.013225 *931.5 = let me compute that more accurately.

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.013225 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.003225 *931.5=approx 3.001 MeV.

So adding those: 9.315 +3.001=12.316 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.316 =5601.316 MeV, which is 5.601316 GeV.

So M = 5.601316 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, the rest mass is M=5.6013 GeV/c². Ok.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c, so beta (β) is 0.96, and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

Wait, wait, wait: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28= approx 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * M c². But since M is already in GeV/c², and c² is (3e8 m/s)^2, but when multiplied by MeV or GeV, perhaps the units work out. Wait, actually, E = gamma * M c². But M is in GeV/c², so when you multiply by c², the c² cancels out, leaving GeV. So E = gamma * M.

Ah, correct. So E = gamma * M.

So M is 5.601316 GeV, gamma is about 3.5714.

So E = 5.601316 * 3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

5 * 3.5714=17.857.

0.601316 *3.5714: Hmm, 0.6 *3.5714=2.1428, 0.001316*3.5714≈0.00468.

So total is 17.857 +2.1428 =20.0 approx, plus 0.00468, about 20.00468 GeV.

Wait, that would be approximately 20.0047 GeV. Hmm.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

Beta is 0.96, beta squared is (0.96)^2= 0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28= exactly 3.5714285714.

So gamma=3.57142857.

So E=5.601316 GeV *3.57142857 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 5.601316 *3.57142857.

Compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.001316 *3.57142857≈ 0.00468.

Adding: 17.85714285 + 2.14285714 =20.0, plus 0.00468 is 20.00468 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.0047 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps my calculation of the rest mass is incorrect. Let me double-check.

The mass of ⁶Li is 6.013225 u. 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013225 u is 6.013225 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

6.013225 *931.5:

=6 *931.5 =5589.

0.013225 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.003225 *931.5: let's compute 0.003 *931.5=2.7945, 0.000225*931.5=0.209. So total is 2.7945 +0.209=3.0035.

So 0.013225 *931.5=9.315 +3.0035=12.3185 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.3185=5601.3185 MeV → 5.6013185 GeV.

So M is 5.6013185 GeV/c².

So E = gamma * M =3.57142857 *5.6013185.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.6013185.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6013185.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0013185= approx 0.004683.

So 2.14285714 +0.004683=2.14754.

So adding to 17.85714285, total is 19.99998 ≈20.0 GeV.

Wait, so why is there an option C at 20.132 GeV? Did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that each nucleon has a mass of approximately 938 MeV? Let me try that approach.

Wait, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², neutron about 939.565 MeV/c².

So sum for 3 protons is 3 *938=2814 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total sum is 2814 +2818.695=5632.695 MeV.

But the actual mass of the nucleus is less than this due to binding energy. The mass defect is (sum of individual masses) - (mass of nucleus). So the total binding energy is about 32.695 MeV (5632.695 -5601.3185=31.3765 MeV?), but wait, that's a positive number, which doesn't make sense because binding energy should be subtracted.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly. The sum of individual masses is 5632.695 MeV, and the actual nucleus is 5601.3185 MeV, so the mass deficit is 5632.695 -5601.3185=31.3765 MeV. So the binding energy is 31.3765 MeV, which is correct.

But how does that affect the rest mass? The rest mass of the nucleus is 5601.3185 MeV, which is correct.

So E = gamma * M =3.57142857 *5.6013185 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should perform this multiplication more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6013185.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6013185= ?

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.0013185 *3.57142857= approximately 0.00468.

So, 0.6013185 *3.57142857≈2.14285714 +0.00468=2.14753714.

Now, adding 17.85714285 +2.14753714=20.00467999 GeV.

So approximately 20.0047 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation gives about 20.0047 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Maybe the ⁶Li nucleus has a different mass. Let me check the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of ⁶Li. Let me look it up: the exact isotope mass of ⁶Li is 6.013225 u, right? So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Beta is 0.96.

So 1-beta² =1 - (0.96)^2=1-0.9216=0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely. 0.0784 is 784/10000, square root is 28/100 =0.28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the atomic mass instead of the nuclear mass. So the problem is about a nucleus, so perhaps the mass is the mass of the nucleus, which is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Wait, because the nucleus doesn't include electrons, right? So for a neutral Li atom, there are three electrons, each with mass about 0.511 MeV/c². So the nuclear mass would be the atomic mass minus 3 * 0.511 MeV.

So let's recalculate. The atomic mass of ⁶Li is 6.013225 u.

So the nuclear mass is atomic mass minus 3 * electron mass.

Electron mass is 0.00054858 u per electron. So 3 electrons: 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass M =6.013225 u -0.00164574 u=6.01157926 u.

Now, convert that to GeV: 6.01157926 u *931.5 MeV/u= ?

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01157926 *931.5= let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00157926 *931.5≈1.472 MeV.

So total is 9.315 +1.472=10.787 MeV.

Adding to 5589, we get 5599.787 MeV, which is 5.599787 GeV.

So, M=5.599787 GeV/c².

Then, E=gamma * M =3.57142857 *5.599787.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.599787= ?

Let me compute 0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.099787 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.099787*3.5714= approx 0.357 MeV.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.599787 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.599787 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.099787 *3.57142857: Let's compute 0.09 *3.57142857≈0.32142857, 0.009787 *3.57142857≈approx 0.035.

So total is approximately 0.3214 +0.035=0.3564.

So 0.599787 *3.57142857 ≈1.785714285 +0.3564=2.142114285.

So E ≈17.85714285 + 2.142114285=20.0 GeV.

Wait, this brings me back to around 20.0 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think: perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is different. For example, perhaps the actual nuclear mass is calculated using the precise binding energy.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the nucleus can be calculated using the formula:

M = Z * m_p + (A - Z) * m_n - B/c²,

where Z is the atomic number, A is the mass number, m_p is the proton mass, m_n the neutron mass, and B the binding energy.

But without knowing the exact binding energy, perhaps I can find M more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus, which I found as 5.599787 GeV/c², without considering the electrons. Now, with that, E=gamma * M =3.57142857 *5.599787.

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

3.57142857 *5.599787.

Break it down into 3 *5.599787 =16.799361.

0.57142857 *5.599787≈?

0.5 *5.599787=2.7998935.

0.07142857 *5.599787≈approx 0.4014.

So 2.7998935 +0.4014≈3.2012935.

So total E=16.799361 +3.2012935≈20.0006545 GeV.

So about 20.00065 GeV.

But the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps the correct approach expects me to use the molar mass without considering the electrons. Hence, giving about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial mass calculation. Because 6.013225 u is the atomic mass, which includes electrons. So the nuclear mass is 6.013225 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, the mass of one electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass is 6.013225 -0.00164574 =6.01157926 u.

So 6.01157926 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 ×931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01157926 ×931.5= 10.787 MeV.

So total is 5589 +10.787=5599.787 MeV, which is 5.599787 GeV.

So E=gamma *M =3.57142857 *5.599787 ≈20.0 GeV.

But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma.

Beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more accurate sqrt.

Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

0.0784 is between 0.28^2=0.0784, exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Therefore, gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the atomic mass of ⁶Li which is 6.013225 u. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is calculated differently.

Wait, another thought: the exact rest mass of ⁶Li is 5.6013 GeV/c², not considering electrons. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the values.

Wait, let me think again. If the atomic mass is 6.013225 u, which includes 3 electrons, then the nuclear mass is 6.013225 u - 3 * electron mass (0.00054858 u).

So 6.013225 -3*(0.00054858) = 6.013225 -0.00164574=6.01157926 u.

So converting that to GeV: 6.01157926 *931.5 MeV/u = 6.01157926 *0.9315 GeV.

Wait, no, 931.5 MeV/u is 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.01157926 u *0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute that.

6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.01157926 *0.9315≈0.01079.

So total is 5.589 +0.01079=5.6 GeV.

Wait, that's 5.6 GeV. So M=5.6 GeV/c².

Then E=gamma *M =3.57142857 *5.6.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

Total is 17.85714285 +2.14285714=20.0 GeV.

Hmm, exactly 20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me compute 6.01157926 u *931.5 MeV/u more accurately.

6.01157926 *931.5 = ?

Calculating 6 *931.5=5589.

0.01157926 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00157926 *931.5=approx 1.472 MeV.

So 9.315 +1.472=10.787 MeV.

So total is 5589 +10.787=5599.787 MeV=5.599787 GeV.

So M=5.599787 GeV/c².

Then E=gamma * M=3.57142857 *5.599787.

Let me compute 5.599787 ×3.57142857.

Let me do this step by step:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.599787= ?

Hmm, 3.57142857 ×0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.099787= approx 0.3564.

So total 1.785714285 +0.3564≈2.1421.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1421 ≈20.0 GeV.

But again, the options don't have exactly 20 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as using the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without subtracting the binding energy. Let me try that.

So sum of protons and neutrons:

3 protons: 3*938=2814 MeV.

3 neutrons:3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total sum:2814 +2818.695=5632.695 MeV=5.632695 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=5.632695 *3.57142857.

Compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.632695 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.5714=2.14285.

0.032695 *3.5714= approx 0.1167.

So 2.14285 +0.1167=2.25955.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.25955≈20.11669 GeV.

That's approximately 20.1167 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Ah, so perhaps the problem assumes that the mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy. That would make the rest mass M=5.632695 GeV/c².

Then E=gamma * M=3.57142857 *5.632695.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.632695.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.032695=approx 0.1167.

So total for 0.632695 is 2.14285714 +0.1167=2.25955.

So E=17.85714285 +2.25955=20.11669 GeV.

Rounding to four decimal places, 20.1167 GeV. The options include option C)20.132 GeV, which is close. The slight discrepancy may be due to more precise values for the masses of protons and neutrons.

But why would the problem take the sum of the individual protons and neutrons? Because, in reality, the nucleus has a mass less than the sum, but perhaps the question expects us to ignore the binding energy for simplicity.

So in that case, the correct energy would be around 20.1167 GeV, which would round to approximately 20.117 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem calculates gamma differently. Let me recheck gamma.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

So if I use the sum approach, M=5.632695 GeV.

E=5.632695 * 3.57142857 ≈20.1167 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1167 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Perhaps due to more precise values of the proton and neutron masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

The proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass is approximately 939.565 MeV/c².

So for 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total sum:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV →5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=5.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.1195.

So 2.14285714 +0.1195=2.26236.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.26236=20.1195 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1195 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering the nucleus's actual binding energy. In that case, the correct answer would be approximately 20.1195 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV, but not exactly matching.

But looking back at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used the atomic mass of ⁶Li, but the problem refers to a nucleus, so perhaps the actual mass is indeed 5.6013 GeV, not considering the electrons. Let me recompute E with M=5.6013 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6013=?

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6013=?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0013=approx 0.00464285.

So 2.14285714 +0.00464285=2.1475.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1475=20.00464285 GeV.

Hmm, around 20.0046 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is C)20.132 GeV, but I'm missing something.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula with the total rest mass including electrons. Wait, but the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, not electrons. So that's not likely.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me sum up:

If the problem expects the rest mass of the nucleus to be the sum of individual protons and neutrons, then E≈20.1195 GeV. Closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

If the problem uses the actual rest mass (atomic mass minus electrons), then E≈20.0 GeV, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass number without considering the electrons. So M=6.013225 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.6013 GeV, leading to E=20.0047 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the nuclear mass as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact values.

Let me compute the rest mass of ⁶Li as 5.6013 GeV.

E=gamma*M=3.57142857 *5.6013.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6013=?

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.0013=0.00464285.

Total 2.14285714 +0.00464285=2.1475.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1475=19.99994285 GeV.

Approximately 20 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)21.419 GeV? No, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think: the question is about the energy of the collider. The collider accelerates the nucleus, so the energy is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or wait, no—particles in accelerators are typically accelerated to high speeds, and their energy is given as the relativistic energy, which includes gamma * m c². So I think I was correct to compute E=gamma * M.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy rather than the total energy. No, the question says "energy of the RHIC", which is the total energy, including rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy. Then, kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * M c².

So for our case, K= (3.57142857 -1)*5.599787 GeV=2.57142857 *5.599787 ≈14.399 GeV. But that's not any of the options either.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look for another approach. Perhaps I should calculate the exact value using precise gamma and M.

M=5.599787 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

E=5.599787 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach:

5.599787 ×3.57142857.

Multiplying 5.599787 by 3.57142857.

5.599787 ×3 =16.799361.

5.599787 ×0.57142857= ?

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.599787 ×4/7 ≈ (5.599787 ×4)=22.399148 /7≈3.199878.

So total E=16.799361 +3.199878≈19.999239 GeV.

Approximately 20.0 GeV.

Hmm. So based on this, the correct energy is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. For example, beta is 0.98c or something else. Wait, no, the question says 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus X is not Lithium-6 but something else. Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So X is ⁶Li.

Hmm. I'm not sure why my calculation isn't matching any of the options. Maybe I should try to compute with more precise gamma and M.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

M=5.599787 GeV.

E=5.599787 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.599787 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.599787 =16.799361.

0.57142857 *5.599787.

Compute 0.5 *5.599787=2.7998935.

0.07142857 *5.599787.

0.07 *5.599787=0.39198509.

0.00142857 *5.599787≈0.007999.

So 0.07142857 *5.599787≈0.39198509 +0.007999≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.599787≈2.7998935 +0.400=3.1998935.

So E=16.799361 +3.1998935=19.9992545 GeV.

So approximately 20.0 GeV.

Given that, I'm not seeing any option matching exactly. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses without binding energy. Let me compute again with M=5.632695 GeV.

E=5.632695 *3.57142857=?

5.632695 *3=16.898085.

5.632695 *0.57142857.

0.5 *5.632695=2.8163475.

0.07142857 *5.632695≈0.404.

So 2.8163475 +0.404=3.2203475.

E=16.898085 +3.2203475=20.1184 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1184 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy, leading to option C.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value of the binding energy. But without knowing the exact value, it's hard to proceed.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but based on the correct physical approach, the answer should be approximately 20 GeV, which isn't an option. However, considering possible approximations in the problem statement, the correct choice would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (defined as \( ^6\text{Li} \)) is \( 0.96c \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the nucleus**: \( ^6\text{Li} \) has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass number \( A = 6 \).

2. **Rest mass energy of \( ^6\text{Li} \)**:
   - The atomic mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is approximately \( 6.013225 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).
   - The mass of 3 electrons is subtracted to obtain the nuclear mass:  
     \[
     M_{\text{nuclear}} = 6.013225 \, u - 3 \times 0.00054858 \, u = 6.01157926 \, u.
     \]
   - Converting to GeV:  
     \[
     M_{\text{nuclear}} = 6.01157926 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5.599787 \, \text{GeV}/c^2.
     \]

3. **Relativistic energy calculation**:
   - The speed is \( \beta = 0.96 \), so \( \beta^2 = 0.9216 \).
   - The Lorentz factor is:  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857.
     \]
   - The total energy is:  
     \[
     E = \gamma M_{\text{nuclear}} = 3.57142857 \times 5.599787 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]
   - Breaking this calculation into parts:
     \[
     3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285, \quad 3.57142857 \times 0.599787 \approx 2.1421.
     \]
     Adding these gives:  
     \[
     E \approx 17.85714285 + 2.1421 = 20.0 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

4. **Consideration of alternative approaches**:
   - If the problem assumes the rest mass is the sum of individual nucleon masses (ignoring binding energy), the total mass would be:  
     \[
     M_{\text{sum}} = 3 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} + 3 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}/c^2.
     \]
   - Recomputing \( E \) with \( M_{\text{sum}} \):  
     \[
     E = 3.57142857 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1195 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]
   - This is closer to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)).

5. **Final analysis**:
   - Using the nuclear mass \( M_{\text{nuclear}} = 5.599787 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), the total energy is approximately \( 20.0 \, \text{GeV} \), but this value is not among the options.
   - If the problem assumes the sum of nucleon masses (ignoring binding energy), the energy is approximately \( 20.1195 \, \text{GeV} \), which aligns closely with option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Given the options and the possibility that the problem ignores binding energy, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
