Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitudes, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means their apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16. Because brighter stars have smaller magnitudes. So a star would be observable by both if its apparent V magnitude is <=16, because that would satisfy both (since 16 is less than 17). Wait but wait, ESPRESSO's limit is brighter than 17, meaning apparent mag <=17. HIRES can handle up to 16. So a star must have apparent magnitude <=16 to be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag. So that means, their magnitude is less than 17, because higher magnitude means fainter. So ESPRESSO's limit is apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16.

So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be observed by both.

So I need to find which stars have apparent V mag ≤16.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distances, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Others have apparent magnitudes given. Let's go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10, so log10(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 + 0=15.5. So apparent mag 15.5. Which is ≤16. So ESPRESSO can see it (15.5<17) and HIRES can see it (15.5<16). So Star1 can be detected by both.

Wait no, wait. Wait, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So apparent mag must be <=16. So Star1's m is 15.5, which is below 16. So yes, both can detect.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's above 16. So HIRES can't observe it. HIRES requires m ≤16. So Star2 is not observable by HIRES, but is it for ESPRESSO? ESPRESSO's limit is m ≤17. So Star2 has m=16.5, which is between 16 and 17. So ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. Wait, no. Wait, Star3's parameters are given as apparent V mag of 15.5? Or is that the absolute magnitude?

Wait, the description says: Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. So the apparent V mag is 15.5. But wait, that's not considering extinction. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects the apparent magnitude. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V, where A_V is the extinction in V band.

The note says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86 mag.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would have been 15.5, but because of extinction, the observed m is higher (since extinction makes stars appear fainter). So the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36 mag. So the observed apparent V mag is 17.36.

So Star3's observed m is 17.36. Which is above both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits. Because ESPRESSO can take up to 17 mag, but wait, 17.36 is above 17. So ESPRESSO can't see it. HIRES can't see it either because it's way beyond their limit.

So Star3 is not detectable by either.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Let me make sure. The apparent magnitude given in Star3's data is the intrinsic or observed? Because sometimes, when E(B-V) is given, the observed magnitude is calculated from the intrinsic.

Wait, the question says: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So I think the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, but that would be incorrect. Because E(B-V) is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. Hmm, perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed one, but then extinction would make it even fainter. Or wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude (i.e., before extinction). I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me re-read. Star3's description: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the apparent V magnitude is the observed (which includes extinction) or the intrinsic (without extinction)?

In astronomy, when you observe a star, the apparent magnitude you measure includes any extinction. So if you know the extinction, you can correct it. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, and the E(B-V) tells us about the extinction, which can be used to calculate the intrinsic magnitude.

Wait, but the question says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag' and then provides E(B-V). So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, and then the extinction is given. So to get the intrinsic m, you subtract the extinction (but in terms of magnitude, it's additive because extinction makes stars appear fainter).

Wait, no, because extinction (absorption and scattering) makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher (more positive) than the intrinsic. So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if the apparent magnitude given is the observed m, and A_V is calculated as 3.1*E(B-V), then the intrinsic m would be m_observed - A_V. But wait, no, because the observed m is higher due to extinction. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, let me think. If a star emits with m=0, but due to extinction, it's observed as m=1. So the observed is higher. So the formula is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

So, if Star3's observed m is 15.5, then the intrinsic (without extinction) is 15.5 - 3.1*0.6 = 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, what's the point of that? Because when deciding if the star can be observed, we need the observed magnitude, as that's what the instruments see.

So Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.86=17.36? No, wait that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star's light is dimmed by extinction, which increases the apparent magnitude (makes it larger). The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

If the star had no extinction, its apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic. But because of extinction, it's m_intrinsic + A_V. So the observed magnitude is larger than the intrinsic.

So in Star3's case, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. But that's the apparent magnitude after considering extinction. Because the E(B-V) is given. So if you know the extinction, you can compute the intrinsic magnitude. But for this problem, perhaps the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the extinction is given. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the extinction is 0.6 (E(B-V)), then the star's actual brightness without extinction would be fainter?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall. Extinction (A_V) is the amount that the star's apparent magnitude increases due to dust. So the observed m is higher by A_V. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m, and extinction A_V, then the observed m_obs = m + A_V.

So in Star3, the problem says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, that would already be the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So if E(B-V) is 0.6, then A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, why is this relevant? Because the spectrographs' limits are based on the observed apparent magnitude. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, and it's at 15 pc. So for the spectrographs, it's the observed m that matters because that's what the instrument detects.

So, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it because 15.5 is less than 17 (ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (HIRES). Wait no, wait. HIRES can only detect up to 16. So 15.5 is less than 16, so yes. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is within both limits. So both can detect it.

Wait, but earlier I thought the given 15.5 was the intrinsic, and the observed is higher. But the question says Star3 has apparent V magnitude 15.5. So I think that's the observed, which includes extinction. So yes, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is below both 17 and 16. So both can detect it.

But wait, does the extinction affect the apparent magnitude as observed by the instrument? Because the given apparent magnitude already includes extinction. So perhaps Star3's observed m is 15.5, so both can see it. Hmm, but that would make it possible. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the extinction must be added. But that's not clear from the question.

In the problem statement, Star3's parameters are: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 mag. So if the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, then A_V is 1.86, which would make the intrinsic m = 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not directly relevant here because the spectrographs observe the star's light as it is; that is, the observed apparent magnitude. So if the observed m is 15.5, then both can detect it. But wait, no, because Star3's parameters are:

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's clarify. Let me think about how apparent magnitude is affected by extinction.

The star emits light with an intrinsic apparent magnitude, m0. But when this light travels through interstellar medium, some is absorbed (extincted), making the star appear dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is m = m0 + A_V.

So if the star's actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, and A_V is the extinction in V band, then the observed m is higher.

In the case of Star3, the problem says it has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. But does that include extinction? Or is that the intrinsic apparent magnitude? Because the E(B-V) is given, which is the color excess due to extinction.

Hmm, the problem says Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6, which is the color excess. So the observed color is (B-V)obs = (B-V)intrinsic + E(B-V).

But the question is about apparent V magnitude. So if the star's distance and absolute magnitude are given, then the apparent magnitude would be m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

But wait, Star3's description says it has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction. Because the distance is 15 pc, and M is absolute V magnitude. Wait, wait no, Star3's description doesn't give M. Wait, let me check.

Wait no, Star3's description says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag and located at 15 pc.

So Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given. So wait, maybe I should compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude, then add the extinction to get the observed apparent magnitude, which is what the instrument measures.

Wait, no. Absolute magnitude is M. The apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = M +5 log10(d/10). Then, the observed m is m0 + A_V.

So let's compute Star3's m0: M is not given. Wait, wait, does Star3 have an absolute magnitude given? Let me check the question.

Wait in the list of stars:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, that's right. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5. But that's the observed, or the intrinsic without extinction? Because the star's distance is 15 pc, but without knowing M, it's hard to calculate m0. Alternatively, perhaps the Star3's apparent magnitude is the observed, so the extinction is E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V is 1.86, making the intrinsic m0 = 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But why would that matter? Because the spectrographs observe the apparent magnitude. So if the star's observed m is 15.5, then that's what matters.

Wait, but in that case, Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits. So it can be detected by both. But wait, that would mean Star3 is detectable. But earlier I thought that the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction adds to it, making the observed m higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the extinction in the apparent magnitude, but that's not the case. Because the problem says to consider the color excess and compute the absorption.

Wait, perhaps I should treat the apparent magnitude as the intrinsic (without extinction) and then add A_V to get the observed m.

So for Star3:

Given: apparent V mag (intrinsic) =15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, which is the observed. Because in the problem description, it's written as "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed, not the intrinsic. So in that case, the extinction doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because extinction would change the apparent magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction adds to it. So the observed m is 15.5 + A_V.

But that would make the observed m higher.

So let me compute.

For Star3:

E(B-V) =0.6, so A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

Assume the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction). So the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So the observed m is 17.36, which is above both 17 (ESPRESSO) and 16 (HIRES) limits. So neither can detect Star3.

So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is too faint for both.

So Star3 is not detectable by either.

Star4: RA =85 deg, DEC =-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So first, compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude m0 = M +5 log10(d/10).

M=15.5, d=10 pc.

log10(10/10)=0. So m0=15.5.

Then, the observed m = m0 + A_V.

A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Which is higher than 16.74. So for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 16.74 is acceptable. But HIRES can only go up to 16. So 16.74>16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude: m0= M +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m0≈15.0.

No extinction given, so observed m=15.0.

Which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both spectrographs can detect it.

So now, let's recap which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=17.36 → neither.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → both detect.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says Star1 and Star4.

But according to this, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, let me recheck Star1 and Star5.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction? Because Star1's description says absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. No E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m=15.5, which is within both limits.

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction. So both detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4. No, because Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is above HIRES' limit.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Star3's m is 17.36, too faint for both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2's m is 16.5 which is above HIRES' limit.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES.

So the only two stars observable by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, none of them say that. Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, none of the options has Star1 and Star5. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Which options have which stars:

Option A: 4 and 5

Option B: 3 and5

Option C:2 and3

Option D:1 and4

Wait, according to my earlier analysis, Star1 and Star5 are detectable by both. So the correct answer would have both. But none of the options match that.

What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let's reevaluate each star.

Rechecking Star3:

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So you can't detect it with either.

Star5: absolute mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. m0=15.0. No extinction.

So, Star5's m=15.0.

Star1: m=15.5.

So, both can be detected by both.

So the two stars are 1 and5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Star4's observed m is 16.74. So for HIRES, which only goes up to 16, it can't detect Star4.

So why isn't an option with Star1 and Star5 available? Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, distance=5 pc.

m0 = M +5 log10(5/10)= 16.5 +5*(log10(0.5)).

log10(0.5) is approximately -0.3010.

So 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m0=16.5 -1.505 =14.995, about 15.0.

Yes, that's correct. So m0=15.0. No extinction, so m=15.0.

So both can detect it.

So with that, the correct answer would be Star1 and Star5.

But none of the options say that. So maybe I made a mistake in considering the apparent magnitude of Star3.

Wait, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is already the observed, and the E(B-V) is given. So the m observed is 15.5, so both can detect it.

Wait, but Star3's description says apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So if that's the observed, then both can detect.

So the options:

Which stars are detectable by both? Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0).

Wait, Star3's m is 15.5, so it's detected by both.

So which options have these stars?

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is 16.74, no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both detectable by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5, only ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 is 16.74, no.

So option B would include Star3 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). Both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's observed m is 15.5, but that would be the case if the given m is already observed. But if the given m is the intrinsic, then observed m is 15.5+1.86=17.36, which is beyond both.

So this depends on whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

The problem states: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So if the apparent magnitude is the observed (which includes extinction), then m=15.5. Both can detect.

Alternatively, if the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), then observed m=15.5 +1.86=17.36. Neither can detect.

So which is the case?

In astronomy, when a star's apparent magnitude is given, it is the observed magnitude, which includes any extinction. So the extinction is given (E(B-V)) to allow correcting the observed magnitude to the intrinsic.

Therefore, in the problem, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed. So m_observed=15.5. So both can detect it.

So, according to this, Star3 can be detected by both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0).

Wait, but then Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both limits. So:

Which stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options don't have all three. The options are pairs.

Looking back:

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4's m=16.74 → no for HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5: both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2's m=16.5 → no for HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star4's m=16.74 → no.

So option B (Star3 and Star5) would be a possible pair.

But wait, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both limits.

So according to this, option B would be correct.

But earlier I thought that Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5 (observed), so it's detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So which options include two of these?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not.

So the answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m is 17.36, but that was under the assumption that the given m is intrinsic, which may not be the case. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the brightness limits of the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. A star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- **Absolute V magnitude**: \( M = 15.5 \)  
- **Distance**: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
- **Apparent V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
  \]  
- **Extinction**: Not provided, so \( m_{\text{observed}} = m = 15.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**  
- **Apparent V magnitude**: \( m = 16.5 \)  
- **Extinction**: Not provided, so \( m_{\text{observed}} = m = 16.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**  
- **Apparent V magnitude**: \( m = 15.5 \)  
- **Extinction**: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
- **Observed V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 > 17 \), so Star3 is not detectable by either spectrograph.

#### **Star4**  
- **Absolute V magnitude**: \( M = 15.5 \)  
- **Distance**: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
- **Intrinsic apparent V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
  \]  
- **Extinction**: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
- **Observed V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star5**  
- **Absolute V magnitude**: \( M = 16.5 \)  
- **Distance**: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)  
- **Apparent V magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
  \]  
- **Extinction**: Not provided, so \( m_{\text{observed}} = m = 15.0 \).  
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)). However, none of the provided options include both Star1 and Star5. Among the given options, **Star3 and Star5** are the closest match, but Star3's observed magnitude (\( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 \)) exceeds the limits for both spectrographs. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the correct answer based on the analysis.

ANSWER: B
