Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about titration, specifically involving acetic acid. Hmm. I've studied a bit about titrations and pH calculations, but I'm not entirely confident. Let's think this through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values. 

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction produces acetate ions and water. The pH will depend on where we are in the titration curve.

Let me break this down into parts. 

Part 1: Calculating the concentration after dilution.
The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will decrease because we've increased the volume. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1+V2). Wait, no, wait. M1 is the initial concentration, V1 is the initial volume, and after adding V2 volume of water, the new concentration M2 is (M1 * V1) / (V1 + V2).

Plugging in the numbers: M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / (20 + 20) = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water makes the total volume 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Part 2: Titration with NaOH.
So the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. We're titrating the 0.025 M acetic acid. 

First, let's find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: we have 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So volume needed at equivalence point is (moles NaOH)/(concentration NaOH) = (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, that's 10 cm³ of NaOH needed to reach equivalence. Because at equivalence, the moles of NaOH (a strong base) equal the moles of acetic acid (a weak acid).

Now, the question asks about 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration—does that mean 25% of the equivalence volume is used? Because sometimes, people refer to the percentage of the volume added relative to the equivalence point. So if the equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So in the titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the percentage of the reaction, meaning 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Let me think. Either way, let's proceed.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. If the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³ added. So the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume at 25% is 40 cm³ (original diluted acid) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH added) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

But wait, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing acetate ions.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has 0.00075 mol of acetic acid and 0.00025 mol of acetate. 

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is log inverse of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73.

Wait, let me compute that precisely. 

Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = 4.73 approximately. Because log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa is about 4.73.

Now, [A-] is 0.00025 mol divided by 0.0425 L, and [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425.

Calculating [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = (0.25e-3) / (4.25e-2) )= (0.25 /4.25) * (1e-3 /1e-2) )= (0.0588) * 0.1 = 0.00588 M.

Wait, wait, let me do it correctly:

0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = (0.00025 / 0.0425) M = (25e-5 /42.5e-3)= (25e-5)/(42.5e-3) )= (25/4250) )= 0.005882 M.

Similarly, [HA] = 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647)= approximately 0.333.

Because 0.005882 is about 1/17, and 0.017647 is about 1/56.56. Wait, wait, let me compute the exact value.

Wait 0.005882 / 0.017647 = (0.00025 /0.0425) / (0.00075 /0.0425) )= 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3 ≈0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈-0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.73 -0.477 ≈4.253. So around 4.25.

Looking at the options, the first part of the answer should be about 4.26. So the first value in the options is A) 4.26 and D)4.57. So let's see what the options are.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B)3.17;6.73
C)4.73;7.00
D)4.57;6.92

So at 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26, which matches option A and D. Hmm, wait, option D's first value is 4.57. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dilution. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M. So that's correct.

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³). So moles of NaOH is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

So initial moles of acid is 0.001, and moles reacted with NaOH is 0.00025. So remaining acid: 0.00075, acetate formed: 0.00025.

Total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

So [A-] is 0.00025 /0.0425 = 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.333.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈4.73 -0.477=4.253, around 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. So maybe that's correct.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will contain the acetate ion in solution, which is a conjugate base of a weak acid. So the solution will be basic, and we need to calculate the pH of this solution.

The volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L. 

Moles of acetate ions: 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

So Kb is small, so the hydrolysis is minimal, but the solution will be slightly basic.

To find the pH, set up the expression for Kb.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 -x). Since Kb is small, x will be much less than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 M. pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98.

pH=14 -4.98≈9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.04e-5 is 1.04 x10^-5.

Log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH=5 -0.017=4.983. pH=14-4.983=9.017, about 9.02.

Looking at the options, none of them have a value around 9.02. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more exact calculation without the approximation.

Let me compute x^2 = Kb * (0.02 -x).

But since Kb is very small, the x will be very small, so the approximation should hold, but let me check.

x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02 )=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So 0.02 -1.04e-5 is approximately 0.01999, which is very close to 0.02, so the approximation is valid.

So pH is around 9.02. But none of the options have this. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, option A's second value is 8.52, D's is 6.92. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Did I calculate Kb correctly?

Ka =1.85e-5, so Kb= Kw/Ka= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 0.05 L (50 cm³), so concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me re-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence point is not using the Kb correctly. Because when all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution contains the acetate ion, which is a weak base. So the pH calculation is correct.

But according to the options, none of the options have pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe the mistake is that the equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base is above 7, but perhaps the calculation is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + (1/2) + log (sqrt( (Kw)/(Ka * C) )) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the pH can be found using the hydrolysis of acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

We can let x be [OH^-], so:

x^2 = Kb * C (acetate) → x = sqrt(Kb * C)

C is 0.02 M.

So x = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.98, pH=9.02.

Hmm. No option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial concentration is not 0.02 M. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, at equivalence point, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³. So 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should account for activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point is not when all the acid is neutralized, but maybe I messed up the calculations. Wait, no, equivalence is when moles of OH- equal moles of acid. So 0.001 mol acid, 0.001 mol OH- needed, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Correct.

Wait, perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, the solution is not just acetate but a buffer? No, no, at equivalence, all the acid is converted to acetate.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka=1.85e-5. Kb= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So in that case, the pH would be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is not asking for the equivalence point pH but something else. Wait, what about using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula for pH is:

pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa - log C )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute [OH^-] more accurately.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part of the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect. Let me recheck.

Wait, the original solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water → total 40 cm³. So new concentration is (20 *0.05)/(40)=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume being added, but perhaps the initial solution is titrated without dilution. Wait, no, the problem says we diluted first.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the initial solution is 40 cm³, and during titration, 25% of the required NaOH is added. Let me re-examine this.

Wait, the total volume of the diluted solution is 40 cm³. So when we add 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence, which is 2.5 cm³, the total solution volume becomes 42.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation. Let's re-calculate the buffer pH.

Moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

So [HA] =0.00075 /0.0425 =0.017647 M.

[A-] =0.00025 /0.0425 =0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882/0.017647 = 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253. So pH=4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So if the first part is correct, then the first value is 4.26, which is option A or none of the others.

But then the equivalence point pH is 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence point considers the hydrolysis of acetate as:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

The expression is Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) = x²/(0.02) → x= sqrt(Kb *0.02)=sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. Let me think. None of the options have this. But wait, the options only have D as 6.92. That's much lower. So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I considered the solution at equivalence point as 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps it's not. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, so moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Volume is 40 +10=50 cm³, 0.05 L. So 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

So I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not neutralized completely, but perhaps I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, another possibility: I used the wrong Ka value. Let me check the problem again. The problem states Ka is 1.85e-5. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but that's unlikely for this problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps at the equivalence point, the solution is not just the acetate ion but also includes some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the initial dilution differently.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and upon dilution with 20 cm³ of water, it's 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, let's think about the equivalence point again. Maybe I should use the formula for a weak base's solution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation without approximation.

So, the equation is Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So, same result as before. So pH=9.02.

Hmm. But none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → first value correct, but second is 8.52, which is lower than my 9.02.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → both lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about the equivalence point again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution's pH at equivalence is calculated using the formula for the salt of a weak acid and strong base, which is pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa - log C). Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated as:

At equivalence, the solution is CH3COO^- in water. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = 0.5 (pKa + pKw + log C )

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the pH of a solution of a weak base can be calculated using the formula:

OH^- = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which is what I did earlier. So if Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02, then OH^- = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution is not 0.02 M acetate. Let me recheck the moles and volume.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M *0.01 L=0.001 mol. Moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. So they neutralize completely to form 0.001 mol of acetate.

Volume is 40+10=50 cm³=0.05 L. So 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. All my calculations point to pH around 9.02, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in an earlier step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation incorrectly. Let me think again about the 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of the titration is 25% of the equivalence volume. So the volume added is 2.5 cm³. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol.

So the moles of acetic acid left are 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH= pKa + log(1/3)=4.73 -0.477=4.25.

That's correct.

So the first value is 4.25, which matches option A's first value (4.26). But the equivalence point is 9.02, which is not an option. So perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using Kb incorrectly. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

Another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence point is not just the acetate ion but also considering the autoionization of water. But that's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me solve this exactly.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ]/(2)

Compute discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 = (2.92e-19)+(4.324e-11) = approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2≈ 3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, wait! That's different. So pH is 8.52? Because pOH is 5.48, pH=14-5.48=8.52.

That matches option A's second value of 8.52.

But why did the approximation give a different result? Because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation isn't valid.

Wait, in the initial approximation, x was 1.04e-5, which is 0.0104 mM. 0.02 M is 20 mM. So x is about 0.05% of 0.02, which is negligible. So why does the exact solution give a higher x?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the quadratic solution.

The equation is:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

= (2.920e-19) + (4.324e-11) = approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -b + sqrt(D) ]/(2a) = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, that's correct! So why did the initial approximation give a pH of 9.02? Because the approximation x<<0.02 holds, but in reality, the x is 3.288e-6, which is about 0.0164% of 0.02. So the approximation is valid. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Because when I assumed x<<0.02, I said x=1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5 M. But when solving the quadratic, I got x=3.288e-6, which is smaller than 1.04e-5. So that can't be right.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the quadratic solution. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the discriminant.

Wait, (5.405e-10)^2 is (5.405)^2 x (1e-10)^2 → 29.20 x 1e-20 =2.920e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D= 2.920e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.324e-11).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11) =6.576e-6.

So x=[ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) →6.576e-6 is 0.000006576, and 5.405e-10 is 0.0000000005405.

So 6.576e-6 -5.405e-10= approximately 6.5755e-6.

Divide by 2: 3.28775e-6.

So x=3.28775e-6 M.

So [OH-]=3.28775e-6.

pOH= -log(3.28775e-6)=5.48.

pH=14-5.48=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is 8.52. Which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got a pH of 9.02, but the exact calculation gives pH=8.52. So why the big difference? Because the approximation was not valid? Or did I make a mistake in the initial approximation.

Wait, let me see: the initial approximation gave x=1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5 M. But the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6 M, which is much smaller. So the approximation wasn't valid, and the exact solution must be used. So why did the approximation give a higher x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Because when I approximated Kb= x²/(0.02), x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=1.04e-5. But if the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of that, then perhaps the assumption x<<0.02 is not valid.

Wait, but 3.288e-6 is about 0.0164% of 0.02, which is negligible. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Wait a second, I think I messed up the Kb. Because I've been using Kb=5.405e-10, but wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute the exact x again.

Equation: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b + sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a)

Where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So, D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = 2.920e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

So putting it all together: at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

But wait, looking back, the initial buffer calculation gave pH=4.25, which rounds to 4.26. So option A's first value is 4.26, second is 8.52.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume is used. The equivalence point volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Equivalence point volume} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic solution for \( x \), the pH at the equivalence point is recalculated to be **8.52**.
