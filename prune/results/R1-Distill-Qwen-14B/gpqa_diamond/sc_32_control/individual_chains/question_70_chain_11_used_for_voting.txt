Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions involving different compounds, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, like how symmetric they are. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what E is.

Let me start by looking at the reactions described.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red product. I'm thinking maybe it's a transition metal compound. For example, I remember that copper(II) compounds are often blue or green, but maybe another metal. Wait, bright red could be something like MnO2? No, MnO2 is black. Oh, wait—could it be an oxide or a sulfide? Or maybe a nitride? Wait, another thought—perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur. Oh, wait, what about the reaction of a metal with a gas to form a compound. If gas B is oxygen, then maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of other possibilities. Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine gas? Because some metals react with Cl2 to form colored compounds. For example, FeCl3 is yellow, but I'm not sure if that's red.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product C is a metal sulfide? Or perhaps a nitride? Or maybe it's a different type of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is sulfur vapor, producing a metal sulfide. But then, the product being red... Hmm.

Alternatively, could this be a reaction involving transition metals and their compounds? Let me think. Oh! Maybe C is a compound like Cu2O, which is a brick red color. So if A is copper, and B is oxygen, then 8 equivalents of B (oxygen) reacting with A (copper) to form Cu2O. Wait, but how does the stoichiometry work? Let's see, for 2 moles of Cu, you need 1 mole of O2, so if A is 2 equivalents, and B is 1 equivalent, but in the problem, 8 equivalents of B are used. That might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think of another angle.

The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, extremely hazardous could mean something like a nerve agent, but more likely in a chemistry context, perhaps something like a highly toxic gas or a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene? Or perhaps chlorine gas? No, because D is a gas, so E is a product of another gas reaction.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen gas, then perhaps they're reacting to form a halide. Or maybe D is a different gas, like carbon dioxide or something else.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is treated with water, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak.

Wait, this reaction. If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide, but that's not two acids. Unless C is a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water might produce something else. Wait, no, if C is a metal oxide, then with water it would form a metal hydroxide, but if it's a non-metal oxide, like SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4, a strong acid. So in that case, perhaps reaction C + H2O gives A (maybe the metal) and the acids. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if C is the oxide, and A is the metal, then the oxide plus water would form the hydroxide, not the metal. Unless it's a different type of oxide.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a red-brown gas. But wait, the problem says C is a bright red product, so nitrgen dioxide is red-brown, so maybe that's not. Or maybe it's another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So if, for example, C is a sulfite, maybe, but then reacting with water might not produce two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate? No, because carbonates reacting with water are already in water. Maybe C is a sulfide, but then sulfides reacting with water could produce H2S (a weak acid) and maybe another acid.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of a metal that when oxidized gives a bright red compound, and when that compound reacts with water, it produces the metal and two acids.

Wait, maybe C is MnO2. MnO2 is a dark brown solid. No, that's not bright red. Hmm.

Another thought: What about the reaction of a metal with sulfur vapor? For example, copper reacting with sulfur to form Cu2S, which is black. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, what about the reaction of iron with sulfur? Iron(III) sulfide is black, I think. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate? No, nitrates are usually colorless or white. Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Let me consider the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, F could be HCl (strong), G could be H2SO3 (weak), but that would require C to be something like SOCl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, and upon hydrolysis produces H2SO3 (weak) and another acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacting with water forms an acid and a base, but since A is a solid, maybe the oxide is basic, so A is the metal hydroxide. But then, the problem says that the acid F is strong and G is weak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving a metal and a non-metal. Let me think of compounds that when reacted with water give two different acids.

Oh! Wait, maybe C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that's not reacting to form two acids upon hydration. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like (NH4)2Cr2O7, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction where C is a metal oxide and something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that would produce the metal hydroxide and CO2, but CO2 isn't an acid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the third reaction. Let me see the other reactions again.

The second reaction: C reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio to produce E. So C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H, a solvent.

So, H is a solvent. Solvents could be things like water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But since B is a gas, perhaps it's something like H2O or another common solvent.

Wait, D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. D and B are gases.

So, B is a gas, D is a gas, and when they react, they form a solvent. Let's think about possible reactions between gases to form solvents.

For example, H2O is a solvent, but it's formed by reacting H2 and O2 (if B is H2 and D is O2, then H2O is the product. So B is H2 gas, D is O2 gas. Or, alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, but D and B each are gases, reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Another possibility: perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O, but that would form H as something else. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, could D be H2O and B be something else?

Wait, another thought: Perhaps H is NH3, which is a solvent. To make NH3 from gases, B and D would have to react in a 1:1 ratio. For example, if B is N2 and D is H2, then 1 N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), but that's made from CO2 and H2 in certain conditions. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of what E is. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is something like Cl2 or HCN. But wait, HCN is a gas, but maybe in a solution. But E would have to come from D, which is a gas, so perhaps D is a gas that when reacted with C forms E.

Wait, another approach: If C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen gas, then C + D might form a halide. But how would that fit with other reactions.

Wait, let me try to make a table of possible reactions.

Assuming:

Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s, bright red)
Reaction 2: C(s) + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)
Reaction 3: C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent)

So, what could each of these be?

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A (solid), F (strong acid), G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is an anhydride that upon hydration produces two acids.

Wait, remember that when some salts are treated with water, they can produce acids. For example, some metal nitrides reacting with water produce NH3 and metal hydroxides. But in this case, it's producing two acids, so perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or some other compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, some metal sulfides react with water to produce H2S gas (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But then, in that case, only one acid (H2S) would form, not two. So that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, then reacting with water doesn't produce any acid. Unless it's a superposition with another acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but I can't think of a reaction where that would produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. If C is CaSO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids, unless it's a more complex compound.

Another possibility: Perhaps C is a mixed oxide, like Fe3O4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the products. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, what pairs of acids are known? For example, HCl and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). Or HNO3 and H2SO4. Wait, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon hydration yields a strong acid and another acid. For example, suppose C is something like (NH4)HSO4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? For example, sarin gas (but that's a pesticide), or something like phosgene (which is a toxic gas, O=CCl2). Phosgene is a toxic gas, but how would it form?

Alternatively, HCN is highly toxic, but how would that form?

Wait, if E is Cl2, but chlorine is hazardous but maybe not extremely so. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound.

Wait, let me think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E.

Suppose that C is a metal oxide, and D is a chloride gas (Cl2). Then C + Cl2 could form a chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, and D is Cl2. Then, upon reaction, they might form HCl and S or something else.

Wait, another thought: if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), how would that form? From CO2 and Cl2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, from Cl2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is HCN, which is a highly toxic gas. How would that form?

Wait, if D is Cl2 and B is O2, perhaps. But not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should go back to reaction 4: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

So, D + B → H (solvent). H is a solvent, so it could be water, ethanol, etc. But since D and B are gases, perhaps H is a liquid solvent formed by their reaction.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So D is H2 and B is O2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So in this case, D is H2, B is O2, H is H2O.

Wait, but looking back at reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C (bright red). So the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C.

What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? Hmm. Let me think of metals that react with oxygen. For example, copper reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black. Iron forms FeO (wustite, black), Fe3O4 (black), or FeO, which is black or red. Wait, FeO is actually black, but Fe3O4 is also black. Wait, another possibility: lead oxide is red. Lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, is a red-brown solid. Alternatively, maybe the product is a different oxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is A being a metal that forms a red oxide. For example, MnO2 is a dark brown solid, but maybe it's a different manganese oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a chromium oxide. Chromium(III) oxide is green, chromium(VI) oxide is orange.

Wait, another thought: if A is FeS, but reacting with O2 would form FeO and SO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Lead(IV) oxide, PbO2, is dark brown, but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a metal reacting with O2 to form a red oxide. For example, maybe A is silver reacting with O2 to form Ag2O, which is a dark brown solid. No, that's not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, what about vanadium pentoxide? It's an orange solid. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product C, when reacted with D (which is H2) and gas D (H2) in reaction 2, produces E. So reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E.

And E is extremely hazardous.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide and H2 is reacting with it, perhaps it's a reduction reaction. For example, if C is CuO and H2 is the reducing agent, then CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But in that case, E would be Cu and H2O, but E is supposed to be a product from this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal hydride or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a different compound. For example, maybe C is Fe3O4, and upon reaction with H2, it reduces to Fe and water. But then E would be Fe and H2O, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but E is a product, so perhaps it's a new compound formed. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a different oxide or a metal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of reaction 3 again. C reacts with H2O to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with H2O would form a metal hydroxide and possibly release an acid. Wait, but that would require the metal oxide to be acidic, which is not typical. Most metal oxides are basic.

Wait, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid. But wait, only H2SO4 is formed. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what about if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3? Reacting with water wouldn't change because it's already in a solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids, it produces CO2 and hydroxide ions. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but in the reaction, it would produce a weak acid if it hydrolyzes further. Wait, no, AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3↑. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that would produce a weak base (calcium hydroxide is basic), but no acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible compounds for E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is something like phosgene (O=CCl2), then what would form it? Phosgene can be made by the dehydration of sodium or potassium carbonate with a chlorinating agent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which is a highly toxic gas. How would that form? If C is a metal cyanide and reacts with H2, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2 and C is CO, then CO + Cl2 under certain conditions could form phosgene, but that might require a catalyst.

Wait, let me try to think of E as phosgene. Then, D would be Cl2, and C would be CO. So reaction 2 is C (CO) + 2 D (Cl2) → E (phosgene, O=CCl2). That could be a possibility. But then, how does CO form in reaction 1?

Wait, reaction 1 is A + 8 B → C (CO). If B is O2, then A would be a substance that burns to produce CO. But under excess oxygen, most hydrocarbons would form CO2. So maybe A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form CO? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe A is a carbon-containing compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not O2 but another gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 4 again. If D is Cl2 and B is O2, then D + B would produce ClO2? No, Cl2 + O2 doesn't react directly. Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, then reaction 4 is H2 + O2 → H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So B is O2, D is H2.

Then, reaction 1: A(s) + 8 O2(g) → C(s, bright red).

What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? Hmm. Let me think of metals and their oxides. For example, lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is dark brown. Iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3, which is reddish. Wait, Fe2O3 is reddish, perhaps that's the bright red C. But wait, Fe2O3 is more of a reddish color, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's another oxide.

Wait, another possibility: if A is carbon, and B is O2, then burning carbon (solid) with excess O2 would form CO2, which is a gas, not a solid. But C is a solid, so that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Let me think of manganese. MnO2 is a dark brown solid. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: If C is FeO, which is a red solid. FeO is actually a black or reddish solid. Maybe that's the bright red product. Then, reaction 1 would be A (Fe) + O2 → FeO (C). So the stoichiometry is Fe + O2 → FeO. The reaction equation is 2 Fe + O2 → 2 FeO. So, for 2 moles of Fe, 1 mole of O2 is consumed. So if A is Fe, and B is O2, then 2 equivalents of B would be needed. But according to reaction 1, 8 equivalents of B are used. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is A (Fe) + O2 → Fe3O4 (magnetite, which is black). No, not red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide. For example, A is FeS, which is black. That's not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of sulfur. For example, if C is S8, but that's not a product of a reaction with a metal and a gas.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of another way.

If in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid), perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is CuS, and when it reacts with water, it might produce H2S (weak acid) and perhaps another acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Si3N4, which reacts with water to produce NH3 and silicic acid. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of E as something like HCl gas. But HCl isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts, but it's a toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, but that's a possible option.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a highly toxic gas like HCN. But how would that form?

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → HCN. That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of E as a product of C and D being a halogen. For example, if C is a compound containing a halogen, and D is another halogen, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should look for the symmetry group.

Wait, the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all symmetry groups. What do they correspond to?

C2: A molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis, no other symmetry elements. For example, H2O has C2 symmetry.

D4h: This is a dihedral group with a 4-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. For example, SF4 has D4h symmetry.

D∞h: An infinite dihedral group, like in a linear molecule with multiple atoms, such as CO2, O2, etc. O2 has D∞h symmetry.

C2v: A molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, SO2 has C2v symmetry.

So, if I can figure out what E is, I can determine its structure and thus its symmetry.

If E is O2, it's diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with a bond order of 2, so its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so its symmetry is D∞h. So option B is D4h, which is not correct for O2.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear, symmetry group D∞h. So if E is CO2, then the answer would be C, D∞h.

Wait, but earlier I thought E might be phosgene, which is O=CCl2. The structure of phosgene is linear, with a central carbon double-bonded to O and two single bonds to Cl. So, the molecular geometry is linear. So its symmetry group would be D∞h. Because it's linear, with a center of inversion and mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

Wait, no. Wait, D∞h has an infinite number of symmetry operations, but for a linear molecule, the symmetry is D∞h.

So if E is phosgene, its structure is linear, symmetry group D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. Ozone has a symmetry group D2h or C2v? Alternatively, ozone has a bent structure with a central oxygen, so it's similar to H2O in geometry. Ozone has C2v symmetry because it has a C2 axis and two mirror planes.

Wait, but O3 has a molecule with a central O with two O's on either side. So, the molecule is bent, like H2O. So, its point group would be C2v.

Hmm. So, if E is O3, its symmetry group would be C2v. Which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is O2, the symmetry is D∞h.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule with bond order 2, so yes, D∞h.

But I'm getting confused because the options include D4h, which is a lower symmetry.

Wait, another example: H2O is C2v. SO2 is C2v.

So, going back, what's E? If E is phosgene, then its structure is linear, so D∞h, which would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O2, which would make it D∞h.

Wait, but looking back, in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 D to form E. If D is H2, then C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is O2, then perhaps C is another form of oxygen, like O3. But that doesn't fit with reaction 3.

Wait, perhaps E is O2. Let me see:

If E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → O2.

Wait, that would require C to be something that releases O2 when reacted with H2. That's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous, though it's a solvent. But in reaction 2, C would have to react with H2 to form H2O. Not sure.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should figure out what E is.

Let me try to piece it all together:

- Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O, then B and D are gases that react to form water. So, possible that B is O2 and D is H2, because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So, B is O2, D is H2. So reaction 4 is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

Then, reaction 1: A(s) + 8 O2 → C (bright red solid).

So, what solid is formed when A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2? Let's consider A as a metal. The reaction would need 8 moles of O2 per mole of A.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead(IV) oxide, PbO2, but that's dark brown. Alternatively, iron(VI) oxide, which is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a carbon-based compound, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is A being a carbon, and B being O2, but that doesn't fit because carbon + O2 → CO2 or CO, which are gases, not solids.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a red oxide. For example, copper(I) oxide is Cu2O, which is a brick red solid. So, the reaction would be:

2 Cu(s) + O2(g) → 2 CuO(s). But that's only 1 mole of O2 per 2 moles of Cu. But the reaction 1 uses 8 equivalents of O2. Hmm, so 2 Cu would require 1 O2, but here it's 8 O2 per 1 A. So, maybe A is a different metal.

Wait, if A is Fe, then:

3 Fe(s) + 2 O2 → Fe3O4 (which is black, not red). So not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide with excess O2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is P (phosphorus). When P reacts with excess O2, it forms P4O10, which is a white solid. Not red.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a red oxide. For example, MnO is a pink or red solid. MnO is manganese(II) oxide. Does that fit?

Manganese(II) oxide is a dark red or black solid. The reaction of Mn with O2 would be:

2 Mn(s) + O2(g) → 2 MnO(s) (red).

In that case, reaction 1 would be 2 Mn + O2 → 2 MnO.

So, if A is Mn, B is O2, then 2 Mn + O2 → 2 MnO. So for 2 moles of A, 1 mole of B is used. But in the problem, reaction 1 uses 8 equivalents of B. So that doesn't fit because 2 A → 1 B, so 8 B would imply 16 A. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 4 Mn + 8 O2 → 4 MnO2. MnO2 is dark brown, but not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is Pb. Lead(II,IV) oxide, Pb3O4, is a red-brown solid. So, perhaps:

4 Pb(s) + 8 O2 → 2 PbO2(s) + 2 PbO(s). Hmm, but that's a combination of PbO2 and PbO, which may be dark brown. Not bright red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a non-metal, like sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3, which are gases. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me think about reaction 3.

C reacts with H2O to form A, F (strong acid), G (weak acid). So, if C is MnO, and H2O is added, perhaps it forms MnO2 and some acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and a weak acid, perhaps it's a mixed oxide. For example, a metal can form an oxide that also contains another element, leading to the production of different acids upon hydration.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, but that doesn't fit with the reaction producing two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like ZnSO3. Reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and Zn(OH)2. But then, where does the strong acid come from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but I can't see how that would produce two acids.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a mixed oxide like PbO2, which upon reaction with water produces H2O and PbO2 doesn't react with water. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. For example, Al(OH)3 reacts with water? No, that's not typical.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal peroxide. For example, NaO2 reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. But that doesn't fit with two acids.

I think I'm stuck on the first reaction. Let me try to make an assumption and see if it fits.

Assuming that A is a metal, B is O2, and C is Fe3O4 (magnetite, which is black, but maybe in some cases appears reddish). Then reaction 3 would be Fe3O4 + H2O → Fe(s) + F and G.

Wait, Fe3O4 reacts with water? No, Fe3O4 is stable in water but can react in acidic conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think of C as a compound that when reacted with H2O, releases a strong acid and a weak acid. For instance, if C is (NH4)HSO4, which is a strong acid and a weak acid, but that's more of a salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate hydroxide. For example, sodium carbonate monohydrate, NaHCO3, but that's not a metal oxide.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, but perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion based on the symmetry group.

If I can't figure out E, perhaps I should think about which symmetry group fits known extremely hazardous compounds.

Let me think: O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, the answer would be D∞h (option C). Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2, linear molecule), its symmetry is D∞h. If E is O3, its symmetry is C2v.

Wait, but O3 is a bent molecule, so its point group is C2v. So if E is O3, then the answer is D) C2v.

But how would O3 form?

Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → O3.

But that would require C to be O2, which doesn't make sense because then reaction 2 would be O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O, but E would be H2O, which isn't extremely hazardous.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClO2, which is a highly toxic gas. ClO2 is a bent molecule, so its point group is C2v. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is a linear molecule, so D∞h symmetry. But HCN is a linear molecule, so its symmetry would be D∞h.

Wait, but HCN is a linear molecule, so its point group is D∞h. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But how would HCN form?

If reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → HCN.

In that case, C would be something like CH3N (not sure), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CHCl3. Then reaction 2 would be CHCl3 + 2 Cl2 → CCl4 + HCl. But that's not producing HCN.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If I think E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is linear, then symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

Alternatively, if E is O2, symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is D∞h. So looking at the options, option C is D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red solids often suggest transition metal oxides, such as MnO or FeO. However, the exact identity of C remains unclear due to the complexity of the reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. E is likely a toxic gas or compound. Possibilities include phosgene (O=CCl₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or ozone (O₃). These compounds are known to be hazardous and fit the description.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C could be a mixed oxide or a compound that releases acids upon hydration. For example, if C is a sulfite or carbonate, it might produce H₂SO₃ (weak acid) and another acid.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent. This aligns with the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - **C₂**: A molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis, such as H₂O.
   - **D₄h**: A dihedral group with a 4-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes, such as SF₄.
   - **D∞h**: A linear molecule with an infinite dihedral group, such as CO₂ or O₂.
   - **C₂v**: A bent molecule with a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, such as SO₂ or O₃.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.
   - If E is O₂, it is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.
   - If E is O₃, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry.
   - Based on the description of E as extremely hazardous and the likelihood of it being a linear molecule like phosgene or O₂, the most plausible symmetry group is D∞h.
