Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm given that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and want to know by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to calculate the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. Luminosity of a star as a black body should relate to its radius and temperature, right?

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The law says that the luminosity L is proportional to R² * T⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, with σ being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the ratio of luminosities would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So if I can find T1 and T2, I can compute the T ratio to the fourth power and multiply by 2.25.

The problem says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. 

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1 = λ2. Then, according to Wien's law, b/T1 = b/T2 → T1 = T2. Oh, wait, that would mean both stars have the same temperature? But that can't be right because their velocities are different, and maybe their masses and radii are different. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the peak wavelength depends on temperature. If both have the same peak wavelength, then their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. Then, the luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, that term would be 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But that would suggest option A is correct. But wait, the velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that affect anything?

Wait a second. The stars are moving with radial velocities. How does that affect their observed brightness? Oh, wait, the brightness is determined by their intrinsic luminosity and any Doppler shift. Because when a star moves towards or away from us, the light is Doppler shifted. So the observed wavelength is different from the emitted wavelength. But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe that's the observed wavelength. If the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths are different, but the observed ones are the same. So I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Oh, right, because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. So the observed wavelength λ_observed is related to the emitted wavelength λ_emitted by the Doppler formula.

Wait, but in this case, the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. So let's denote λ_obs as the same for both. So for each star, λ_obs = (1 + v_r/c) * λ_emit, where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), assuming v_r is much less than c. But since the velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, let's see: c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is 0.23% of c. So the approximation might be manageable.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r/c) when v_r is small compared to c. Because when moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs would be longer (redshifted). When moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ_obs is shorter.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. Let me denote this as λ_obs. So for Star_1, which has v_r = 0, the observed λ is the same as emitted λ. So λ_emit_1 = λ_obs. For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s moving away (assuming positive if moving away, but not sure; but the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700, so Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c). Because when moving away, the wavelength is stretched, so λ_obs > λ_emit. 

Wait, I think the approximate Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away. So for Star_1, v_r=0, so λ_emit_1 = λ_obs. For Star_2, v_r=700 km/s. So λ_obs = λ_emit_2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)). Let me compute 700/(3e5). 3e5 is 300,000. 700 / 3e5 is 0.002333... So 1 + 0.002333 = approximately 1.002333.

So λ_obs = λ_emit_2 * 1.002333. But λ_obs is the same as λ_emit_1, because Star_1's λ_obs is λ_emit_1.

So λ_emit_2 = λ_obs / 1.002333 ≈ λ_emit_1 / 1.002333. Therefore, λ_emit_2 ≈ 0.997667 * λ_emit_1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the temperatures? Because T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So T = b / λ_max. So if λ_emit_1 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c), or λ_emit_2 = λ_emit_1 / (1 + v_r2/c), then T_emit_2 = (1 + v_r2/c) * T_emit_1.

Wait, no. Because λ_emit is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_emit_2 = λ_emit_1 / (1 + v_r2/c), then T_emit_2 = (1 + v_r2/c) * T_emit_1. Because if λ goes down, T goes up. Wait, let me think: λ_emit_1 = b / T1, λ_emit_2 = b / T2. So if λ_emit_2 = λ_emit_1 / (1 + v_r2/c), then (b/T2) = (b/T1) / (1 + v_r2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c). So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333 approximately.

So the temperatures are not the same as I thought earlier. So the initial assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because I didn't consider the Doppler shift. Oh, that's a crucial point! So I need to take into account the Doppler effect on the wavelengths to find the actual temperatures.

Let me re-examine the problem. The observed peak wavelengths are the same, so λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2 = λ_obs.

For Star_1: since v_r1 = 0, λ_emit_1 = λ_obs. So T1 = b / λ_emit_1.

For Star_2: λ_obs = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c). So λ_emit_2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c) → T2 = b / λ_emit_2 = b * (1 + v_r2/c) / λ_obs.

But T1 = b / λ_emit_1 = b / λ_obs.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Compute 700/(3e5) = 700/300000 = 0.002333333...

So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333. So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ 1.002333 T1.

Now, back to the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4πσ R1² T1⁴

L2 = 4πσ R2² T2⁴

So L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴).

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = 2.25.

And T2 = 1.002333 T1 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 → T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute that: 0.99767^4.

Let me compute 0.99767^2 first.

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 → approximately 0.995345.

Then square that: 0.995345^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 → 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216 → approx 0.9906916.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9906916.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906916 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.9907 → 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, but more precisely:

0.9907 = 0.99 + 0.0007.

So 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Wait, but I might have missed a step. Because (0.99767)^4 was about 0.99069. So 2.25 * 0.99069 is approximately 2.25 * 0.9907 → 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, 2.25 * 0.0007≈0.001575, so total ~2.229.

Wait, but 2.25 * 0.9907 is about 2.229. So the luminosity ratio would be approximately 2.229. Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23, which seems to match this.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because the Doppler shift calculations can be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (T1/T2)^4.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c) → (T1/T2) = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c) = 1/(1 + 0.002333333) ≈ 0.997667.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.997667^1 = 0.997667.

^2: 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me do it precisely.

0.997667 * 0.997667.

Compute (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 = 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544 → 0.99533944.

Now, square that to get ^4: 0.99533944^2.

Compute (0.99533944)^2.

= (1 - 0.00466056)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2 → 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172 → 0.99067859.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9906786.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9906786) → 2.25 * 0.9906786 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is very close to 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but why is the Doppler shift causing the luminosity to decrease? Because Star_2 is moving away, which we thought would cause its emitted wavelength to be blueshifted, but no, wait, no. Wait, the observed peak wavelength is the same. Because Star_1 is stationary, and Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is longer than its emitted. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength. Because when Star_2 moves away, its light is redshifted, but to match the observed wavelength of Star_1, its emitted wavelength must be shorter. Hence, Star_2's emitted light is at a shorter wavelength, which implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but earlier calculations found T2 ≈ 1.002333 T1. So T2 is slightly higher than T1. Since luminosity depends on T^4, that would mean that even though R is 1.5 times, the T factor would make the luminosity a bit higher. But in the ratio, L1 is 2.25 times L2 without considering the T effect, but because T2 is a bit higher, the (T1/T2)^4 factor is less than 1, which reduces L1/L2.

Wait, but wait, no. Because T2 is higher, then T1 is lower than T2. So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c). So when you take (T1/T2)^4, it's (1/(1 + v_r2/c))^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.99067. So that factor reduces L1/L2 from 2.25 to about 2.229.

So the correct ratio is approximately 2.229, which is option D (~2.23), so the correct answer is D.

Wait, but now I'm a bit confused why the Doppler shift affects the temperature. Let me think again. Since the observed peak wavelength is the same for both, but Star_2 is moving away, the actual emitted wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than what's observed. So the emitted wavelength λ_emit2 is less than λ_obs, meaning the temperature T2 is higher than T1. Because λ_emit is inversely proportional to T. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c) → higher T.

So when calculating the luminosity, which depends on T^4, a higher T would make L2 larger compared to L1, but since R is larger for Star_1, it's a balance between R² and T^4.

But in the problem, Star_1 has R =1.5 R2. So R1² is 2.25 R2². But T2 is higher than T1. So the L ratio L1/L2 would be (2.25) * (T1^4)/(T2^4). Since T2 > T1, (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, so the factor is less than 2.25. Which is why the ratio is about 2.23 instead of 2.25.

So I think option D is the right answer.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity \( L \) to radius \( R \) and temperature \( T \):  

\[
L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4
\]

The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Therefore:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), but their radial velocities differ. Using the Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r}{1 - v_r}}
\]

For Star_1 (\( v_r = 0 \)), the observed wavelength equals the emitted wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \). For Star_2 (\( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), the emitted wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r}{1 - v_r}}}
\]

Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1 + v_r}{1 - v_r} = \frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333} \approx 1.00467
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \approx \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\sqrt{1.00467}} \approx \lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot 0.997667
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}} = \frac{1}{0.997667} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

First, calculate \( \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4
\]

Using approximations:

\[
(0.997667)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad (0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Finally:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Match to Options
The closest option to \( 2.229 \) is \( \sim 2.23 \), corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D
