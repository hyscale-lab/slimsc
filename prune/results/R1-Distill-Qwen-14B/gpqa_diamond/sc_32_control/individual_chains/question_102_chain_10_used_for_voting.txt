Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to study their interaction. The question revolves around a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't observed in the mice.

Let me first process the construct details. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one transcript. The ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor ORF can be translated as a separate protein after the ligand's ORF is translated.

The stop cassettes are important. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, these stops prevent the fusion proteins from being made unless the stop is excised by Cre.

Wait, so when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes. I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. Oh, right, because Cre recognizes loxP, and another recombinase might do lox2272, but wait, I think lox2272 is a variant that's recognized by Cre but with a different recombination orientation.

So the vector is set up so that when Cre is expressed, the stops are removed. This allows the ORFs to be expressed as separate proteins. So mCherry would be after the ligand (if the stop is excised) and eGFP after the receptor.

Wait, but in the construct, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end. So the transcript starts with ligand, then an internal ribosome entry site for the receptor. So the mRNA is for ligand and receptor, each under their own promoters. No, wait, no, the same transcript. The CBA promoter is for the ligand, but how is the receptor's expression regulated? Oh, because the IRES is upstream of the receptor. IRES elements can drive the translation of the downstream ORF without the need for a separate promoter. So the same mRNA would have both ligand (with CBA promoter) and receptor (after IRES). But since it's a bicistronic construct, each part is under different regulatory elements.

Wait, but the CBA promoter would drive the expression of the ligand. The IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein from the same transcript. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be fused with mCherry because the stop is in between. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop before eGFP, so it wouldn't be expressed unless Cre excises the stop.

Wait no, the stop is between ligand and mCherry (loxP cassette). So in the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so mCherry isn't expressed as a fusion. Similarly, the receptor has a stop before eGFP (lox2272), so eGFP isn't expressed unless the stop is removed.

But when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP stops and the lox2272 stops. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

Now, the experiment involved crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So Cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, I suppose.

Wait, but the construct is in the mice, so in the offspring where the construct is present, Cre (from SOX10-Cre) would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, and receptor and eGFP as another fusion. But in the question, they don't see a green signal, which is eGFP.

So possible reasons why eGFP isn't expressed:

1. The recombination didn't happen, so the stop remains. But the mouse was homozygous for the construct, and the Cre is present. So probably, the stop should have been removed.

2. Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is in the wrong frame, or the construct is not in frame. Wait, the options. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the ORF is not in frame after the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly. But the stops are loxP and lox2272. When Cre excises them, the ORFs are left intact, so if the frame is correct, eGFP should be expressed.

Another possibility is about the expression. When you have a stop cassette, its removal allows the ORF to be translated. So if the construct isn't correctly excising, like if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, Cre might not be able to recombine, leaving the stop in place. But the mouse is homozygous and crossed with Cre, so the construct should be recombined.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so without proper internal ribosome entry, the receptor's ORF isn't translated. Wait, but in the presence of the IRES, the receptor should be expressed as a separate protein. Or perhaps the IRES isn't functional in the cells used, like primary astrocytes, but the question says the mouse is crossed, so the expression would be in the mouse's cells, which might be different.

Wait, another angle. The vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor after IRES. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be translated even if the stop is removed. Alternatively, perhaps in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed but not the receptor. Wait, no: the IRES allows the receptor to be translated without Cre, but the eGFP is behind a stop that Cre excises.

Wait, the setup in the vector: the ligand has a stop in loxP, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry. The receptor has a stop in lox2272, so without Cre, the receptor can't be expressed with eGFP. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps the receptor's expression is independent of Cre in terms of translation, but the eGFP is only expressed if Cre removes the stop.

Wait, no. The IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated without the need for a separate promoter. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the receptor's ORF is translated, but the eGFP is behind a stop. So the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. But when Cre is present, the eGFP would be expressed.

Wait, but the question says after crossing to SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show a green signal. So the Cre should have been active, excising the lox2272 stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion. So why no green?

Possibility: The eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong. So the ORF is disrupted. Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop is removed but the reading frame is not correct, eGFP won't be made. But why would that happen? Oh, because the vector's construction could have put the eGFP in the wrong frame.

Alternatively, the reason could be that the construct is not properly recombined. But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so perhaps the Cre didn't work. Or perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed.

Wait, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be active in neural crest derivatives. If the receptor and ligand are expressed in neural crest cells, then the Cre would excise the stops. But in the mouse, they're looking for eGFP expression, which isn't present. So maybe eGFP isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't working, or the eGFP is not expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the vector's design is such that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't properly excised. But the mouse was crossed with Cre, so it should have been.

Looking at the options, option B says the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct is not transported to the cell surface, then you wouldn't see green in the confocal. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the signal peptide is missing, or some other trafficking issue.

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is presumably strong. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter for its expression.

Option A says the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the transfection, the construct is present in the same cells, so autocrine signaling would be possible. But in the mouse, the expression would still be in the same cell. So not sure how this would affect the Western blot or the fluorescence.

Wait, but the question is about why there's no green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem could be in the expression of the eGFP.

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not functional. But that wouldn't prevent a fluorescent signal if the eGFP is expressed.

Alternatively, the IRES might not function in the cells, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive translation without a promoter. Hmm.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand under CBA and the receptor after IRES. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is expressed without eGFP. With Cre, both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But the question is about the mouse model that's homozygous for the construct. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre, which should induce Cre activity in neural crest cells. So the eGFP should be expressed in those cells where SOX10 is active.

But they don't see a green signal. So possible reasons:

1. The eGFP isn't being expressed because the construct wasn't recombined. Maybe the Cre isn't active, but the mice are supposed to have SOX10-Cre.

2. The eGFP is expressed but not in the right place, or the cells where it's expressed aren't imaged.

But the options don't address that. Looking back at the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if the ORF is not correctly in frame, then eGFP isn't expressed. That would mean the eGFP is not made. So in the Western blot, we wouldn't see it either. But the question says that after transfection, they tested the expression and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, but in the transfection, the construct might have been transiently expressed, whereas in the mouse, the construct is presumably integrated.

Wait, let me re-read the question. They transfected primary astrocyte culture and ran a Western blot. The total proteins gave a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working and loading is correct. But why would the Western blot show signals? Because they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the ligand and receptor are expressed, you should see bands. But the mouse model's issue is about the expression of eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the Western blot showed that the ligand and receptor were expressed, but the eGFP wasn't. So in the Western, perhaps the eGFP isn't present.

But the question says that after transfection, the Western blot was done. The user used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the construct is present. Or maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't excised.

But in the mouse, when Cre is present, the stops should be removed. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Another possibility is the expression of the Cre. If the Cre isn't active, the stops remain, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active, excising the lox sites.

So the only other possibility is that the construct isn't correctly recombined. Alternatively, the eGFP is not properly expressed.

Looking at the vector, the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop cassette. The IRES allows for the translation of the receptor. So when Cre is present, the stop is excised, and the receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the ORF is not correctly in frame. So when the stop is excised, the receptor's ORF is correct, but the eGFP is in the same reading frame.

Wait, looking at the construct: the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame, right? But if they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. So that's what option D says.

So if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then after excising the stop, the ORF would have a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't translated. Thus, no green signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But then, the Western blot after transfection would have shown whether the ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the mouse, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but the CBA promoter would drive the ligand. But the question is about eGFP not being expressed, not the ligand.

Hmm. Another angle: the vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor after IRES. The IRES allows for the receptor to be translated. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but the ligand would. But in the mouse, since the construct is present, and Cre is added, I'm not sure.

Wait, the eGFP is downstream of the receptor, so if the stop is correctly excised, the receptor-eGFP fusion should be expressed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP won't be expressed. That would fit option D.

So the most likely reason is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned downstream of an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, with stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) between the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, respectively. Cre recombinase, provided by SOX10-Cre mice, is expected to excise these stop cassettes, allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins.

Key observations include the absence of a green signal (eGFP) in the offspring after crossing the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice. The possible reasons for this outcome are analyzed as follows:

1. **Option A (ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship):**  
   A paracrine relationship implies that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cell, making this explanation unlikely.

2. **Option B (the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi):**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were trafficking improperly, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence detection. However, there is no evidence provided to suggest a trafficking defect, making this less likely.

3. **Option C (the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing):**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is driven by the IRES element, which does not require a promoter. This makes an enhancer defect an unlikely explanation.

4. **Option D (the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame):**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the removal of the stop cassette by Cre would not result in proper translation of eGFP. This would prevent eGFP expression and explain the absence of fluorescence. This is the most plausible explanation.

The absence of a green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame, preventing proper translation of eGFP.
