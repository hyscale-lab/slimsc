Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D, but I don't need to worry about them yet—I'll figure it out.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. So, all the particles have the same charge, which is 2e. I remember e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. Each particle has 2e, so that's 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

The setup is that 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So, point P is where one charge is, and the others are arranged in a sphere (I think) around it at radius 2 meters.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, they're all at the same distance from P. That probably means they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, the exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy, which depends on the distances between each pair.

Right, so I know that the electrostatic potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since it's an isolated system, we can ignore any external fields, I think.

The formula for the potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But when calculating the total potential energy of the system, we have to consider all pairs. For a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since each pair contributes once, we can compute it by considering each pair.

Wait, but in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 m from P. So, the distance between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2 m. Also, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be something else, but since they are all at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances depend on the geometry. But this might complicate things because the distance between any two of the 12 charges isn't the same.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy". Hmm. Wait, but the charges are fixed in some way—12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the positions of the 12 are fixed relative to P, but their arrangement among themselves could vary. So, perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when the mutual repulsion (since all have the same charge) is minimized. But wait, same charges repel, so to minimize the potential energy, we want them as close as possible? But they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. Oh, but perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the mutual potential is when they are arranged symmetrically so that the potential between each pair is minimized by being as close as possible. Or maybe that's not the case, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. So, the system's potential energy includes all the interactions between each pair. But perhaps the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12, and the 12 also interact with each other.

So, to compute the total potential energy, I need to compute the sum over all pairs.

Total U = U_between_13th_and_12 + U_between_pairs_among_12.

Let me think. So, the first term is the energy between the 13th charge (q13) and each of the 12 charges. Each of those 12 charges is located 2 m away from q13, so the distance r between q13 and each q_i (i=1 to 12) is 2 m. Since each has charge 2e.

So, the energy between q13 and each q_i is U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2). So U_i = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

Wait, because each charge is 2e, so (2e) times (2e) is 4e². Then divided by 2 m. So each pair contributes 2 k e².

And since there are 12 such pairs, the total for this part is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, each pair is counted once. So, when you have 13 charges, one of them is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So, for each of the 12 charges, the pair (q13, qi) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So each is U_i = (k *4 e²)/2 = 2 k e². So for 12 pairs, that's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, that's the first part. The second part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. So, the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances depend on how they're arranged. So, the mutual potential energy would be the sum over all pairs of the 12 charges of the potential energy between each pair.

But, wait, how many such pairs are there? For 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is C(12, 2) = (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

Each of these pairs is at some distance r_ij from each other. Since all are at 2 m from P, the triangle formed by P and any two charges would have sides of 2 m each. So, the distance between two charges would depend on the angle between their positions relative to P.

Wait, but the exact value of r_ij for each pair can vary depending on the arrangement. If the charges are arranged in a regular fashion, like on a sphere, perhaps the distances are the same. But that might not be the case. But in any case, the problem might assume that the 12 charges form a regular icosahedron or some regular polyhedron around P. But alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified by considering that all mutual distances are the same. Wait, but that's probably not the case, because 12 points on a sphere can't all be equidistant.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th, and not their mutual interactions. But that can't be right because the problem states the 12 are constrained at 2 m from P, but they can move among themselves, but perhaps their mutual distances are not fixed. But in that case, the mutual potential energy would be the sum of their individual pairs.

Wait, but to find the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged as far apart as possible. Wait, but same charges repel, so to minimize potential energy (which is positive for like charges), you would arrange them as far apart as possible, but in this case, they're constrained to be at 2 m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances are such that the sum of their mutual potential energies is as small as possible.

Wait a moment, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So, perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all the interactions, including the 12 charges' mutual interactions.

But to compute that, I need to know the mutual distances between each pair of the 12 charges. But without knowing their exact positions, this seems impossible. However, maybe the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy between the 13th charge and the others. Or perhaps the problem is such that the mutual energy of the 12 charges is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all the same, which would be the case if they're equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and ignores the mutual energy between the 12 charges. Let me check the options. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J, which is very small, so perhaps the mutual energy is negligible compared to the energy from the 13th charge. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th charge's interaction. Maybe that's the case.

Wait, but the problem says it's the minimum energy of the system. So, the system includes all 13 charges. So, the potential energy between each pair must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are as close as possible to each other, but constrained to be 2 meters from P. Wait, but since the charges are identical and repel each other, the minimum energy would be when they are as far apart as possible. So, perhaps arranging them as far apart as possible on the sphere, which would minimize the number of close interactions. But perhaps in this case, all 12 are equally spaced on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, so each pair is equally distant, but the distance would vary because you can't have all pairs equally spaced on a sphere of 12 points.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and only the energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge is considered.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, their positions are fixed relative to P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So, the mutual potential energy between them would vary depending on their arrangement. But the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system, so perhaps we need to find the arrangement that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So, perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the sum of all potential energies is when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible. Since the charges are positive (each 2e), their mutual potential energy is positive because U = k q1 q2 / r, and since q1 and q2 are positive, U is positive. So, to minimize the total energy, we need to arrange the charges such that the sum of all mutual U's is as small as possible. But since all mutual U's are positive, the minimum sum would be when each U is as small as possible.

Wait, but the mutual U depends on how close the charges are. If they are placed as far apart as possible, their U would be smaller. So, perhaps the minimal total mutual energy occurs when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible from each other, given their constraint of being 2 m from P.

But arranging 12 charges on a sphere to maximize the minimal distance between any two—wait, that's a problem in sphere packing. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the mutual energy can be ignored or considered in a simplified way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual energy between the 12.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the entire system. So, it must include all interactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: Each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from the 13th. The potential energy between each pair (13th and each of the 12) is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So for 12 pairs, that's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, for the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges, each pair contributes U =k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th of the 12 charges.

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, I can't compute the exact sum. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. That would make the calculation straightforward. Let me check the options again.

Wait, but the options given are on the order of 1e-26 J. Let me compute the energy from the 13th charge to the 12.

Compute 24 k e².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So, 2e would be 3.204e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2 is (3.204e-19)^2 = approx 1.026e-37 C².

So, 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2 m) ?

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought each pair between the 13th and a charge is 2 k e², but wait:

Wait, each pair is (2e) * (2e) = 4 e², divided by 2 m, multiplied by k.

So, each pair's energy is (4 e²) * k / (2) = 2 k e².

So, 12 pairs: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So, compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, e is 1.602e-19, so (2e)^2 is 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * (2.566e-38) = 1.026e-37 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 / 2 ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So, the energy per pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (k *4 e²)/2 = 2 k e².

So for 12 pairs, 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So, 24 * k * e².

Wait, wait. No, because (2e)*(2e) is 4e², so the U per pair is k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So, 12 pairs: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So, 24 * k * e², where k is 8.988e9, and e is 1.602e-19.

So, compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = approx (1.602)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

Wait, 24 *8.988e9 = let me compute 24 * 8.988.

8 *24 = 192, 0.988*24=23.712 → 192+23.712 = 215.712 → so 215.712e9.

Now multiply by e² (2.566e-38 C²):

215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Compute 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) * 1e(11-38) = (5.538) * 1e-27 ≈ 5.538e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 5.538e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about ten times higher than this. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2) → because the distance is 2 m.

Wait, no, the U for each pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 12 pairs, so 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Ah, so the calculation is correct: 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2=2.566 → 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 → 24 *8.988=24*8=192, 24*0.988=23.712 → 192+23.712=215.712 → 215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = (215.712 * 2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38.

Compute 215.712 * 2.566.

Compute 200 * 2.566 = 513.2.

15.712 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute 15 * 2.566 = 38.49, 0.712 *2.566≈1.826 → total ≈ 38.49+1.826=40.316 → total 513.2 +40.316=553.516.

So, approximately 553.516 × 1e-29 → 5.53516e-27 J.

Wait, this is about 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about ten times higher.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Oh, wait no: the energy between each pair is (k q1 q2)/r, so for each pair, it's (k * (2e) * (2e))/(2 m). So that's (k *4e²)/2 = 2 k e² per pair. So for 12 pairs, it's 24 k e².

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as fixed, but the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically, so perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron around P. But in that case, the mutual distances would all be the same. Wait, but can 12 points be arranged on a sphere such that all mutual distances are the same? I don't think so; that's only possible for certain numbers of points, like the Platonic solids. For example, a regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, but then each vertex is equidistant from its neighbors. Wait, no, actually, in an icosahedron, each vertex is the same distance from its adjacent vertices, but the distance varies for non-adjacent vertices. So mutual distances between any two vertices are not all the same.

Hmm, perhaps this is a dead end. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, which isn't possible, or perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential is negligible compared to the other term, so it's ignored. But that would imply only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the 12, which gives about 5.53e-27 J, which isn't any of the options exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, 12 charges each interact with the 13th, so 12 pairs. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the energy to be calculated as (12 * (k * (2e)^2) ) / (2 * 2m) or something like that. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Compute 24 * k * (2e)^2.

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2 is (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.269e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 10.269e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.269e-38 = 8.988e9 * 1.0269e-37 = ?

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

1.0269e-37 is 1.0269 * 1e-37.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 1.0269 ≈ 9.235.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So, 9.235e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 9.235e-28 *24 = 221.64e-28 = 2.2164e-26.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 24 * 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

(3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 = 10.269 → 10.269e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 10.269e-38 = 8.988 *10.269 = let's compute that.

8 * 10 =80, 8*0.269≈2.15, 0.988*10=9.88, 0.988*0.269≈0.266.

So 80 +2.15 +9.88 +0.266 ≈ 92.3.

So 92.3e(9-38) → 92.3e-29 = 9.23e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 9.23e-28 *24 = (9.23 *24) e-28.

9 *24=216, 0.23*24=5.52 → 216+5.52=221.52.

So 221.52e-28 → 2.2152e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.215e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (3.204e-19)^2. Let me compute it accurately.

3.204e-19 * 3.204e-19 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38.

3.204^2 = (3 + 0.204)^2 = 9 + 2*3*0.204 + (0.204)^2 = 9 + 1.224 + 0.041616 = 10.265616.

So 10.265616e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 *10.265616e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.265616e-38 = 8.988 *10.265616 = let me compute that.

8 *10=80, 8 *0.265616≈2.1249, 0.988 *10=9.88, 0.988 *0.265616≈0.2623.

So 80 +2.1249 +9.88 +0.2623 = 80+2.1249=82.1249 +9.88=92.0049 +0.2623=92.2672.

So 92.2672e(9-38) = 92.2672e-29 → 9.22672e-28.

Multiply by 24: 9.22672e-28 *24 = 221.4413e-28 → 2.2144e-26 J.

Which is approximately 2.2144e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, in the initial setup, each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So, the energy between q13 and each q_i is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4 k e²)/2 = 2 k e².

But wait, why the division by 2? Because each pair is counted once. Wait, no, if you have two charges, each pair is counted once. So, when calculating the total potential energy, each pair contributes once. So, for 12 pairs, you have 12 * (their individual U).

Wait, no, the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th. So, each of those 12 interactions is a single pair. So, for each of the 12, you compute U = k q13 qi / r, which is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = 2 k e². So total for this part is 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me recompute that.

(2e) is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So, (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 = 10.265616 → 10.265616e-38 C².

So, 24 *8.988e9 *10.265616e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.265616e-38 = 8.988 *10.265616 = 92.267 (approx) → 92.267e-29 → 9.2267e-28.

Multiply by 24: 9.2267e-28 *24 = 221.44e-28 → 2.2144e-26 J.

Hmm, so that would be approximately 2.214e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 2.822e-26, which is higher. So why is this discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Wait, no. Let me think, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge in the 12 is interacting with the 13th, but the 13th is fixed, so each interaction is a single pair, not double-counted. So, the calculation is correct.

But the result I'm getting is about 2.214e-26 J, which is not exactly any of the options. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of e². Let me recompute e squared.

Wait, e is 1.602176634e-19 C.

So, e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2 → 2.56696988e-38 C².

So, (2e)^2 is (3.204353268e-19)^2 = (3.204353268)^2 → approx 10.2656e-38.

So, 10.2656e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 *10.2656e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.2656e-38 = 8.988 * 10.2656 = 92.267e-29 → 9.2267e-28.

Multiply by 24: 9.2267e-28 *24= 221.44e-28 → 2.2144e-26 J.

So, that's about 2.214e-26 J.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B, which is 2.822e-26. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also considered. Let's see what that would look like.

Calculating the mutual potential energy between all 12 charges.

Each pair contributes U = k * (2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, how to proceed?

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equally distant from each other, which is only possible in certain configurations. For example, if all 12 are placed on a sphere in a regular icosahedron configuration, the average distance between any two points would be the same. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the 12 charges as a spherical shell with radius 2 m, and each charge is at the same distance from the center, but their mutual distances vary. But without knowing each r_ij, we can't compute the exact sum.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not possible because same charges repel, so their potential energy would be positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy from the 13th charge, and the mutual energy is zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is not considered, and only the energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is considered. In that case, the total energy would be approximately 2.214e-26 J.

But none of the options exactly match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 5.645 x 10^-26
B) 2.822 x 10^-26
C) 7.056 x 10^-27
D) 122.330

Hmm, option B is approximately twice what I computed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So, the distance between the 13th charge (q13) and each of the 12 is 2 m.

The energy for each pair (q13 and qi) is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4 e² k )/2 = 2 e² k.

For 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

So, 24 e² k.

Compute that.

e =1.602e-19 C.

e squared is 2.566e-38 C².

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e(9-38) = 22.985e-29 → 2.2985e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.2985e-28 =55.164e-28 →5.5164e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.516e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. So that's not matching.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e(9-38) = 22.985e-29 → which is 2.2985e-28.

Then, 24 * 2.2985e-28 = 24 * 2.2985e-28 =55.164e-28 → which is 5.5164e-27 J.

So, approximately 5.516e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual energy is considered as zero, which isn't correct, but perhaps the problem neglects it.

Wait, but then the calculation would give about 5.516e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 *2.566 ≈ 22.985.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So, 22.985e-29 → 2.2985e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.2985e-28 =55.164e-28 →5.5164e-27 J.

Hmm. So, about 5.516e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. Maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3) or something else, but I can't think of why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular tetrahedral configuration, which would mean that each charge is equidistant from the others, but with 12 points, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but in a way that each pair contributes a certain amount.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero when the charges are arranged in a way that they form a regular dodecahedron, which is a 12-faced polyhedron, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is considered as zero, which is not possible because same charges repel.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, which would require them to be as close as possible. But since all are at 2 m from P, perhaps they arrange themselves in a regular manner around P, like on a sphere. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is zero, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and that's all. So, the total energy would be 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2 m) → wait, no, earlier calculation.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, that gives 5.516e-27 J, which isn't an option. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exponents correctly.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Compute 2e =3.204e-19 C.

Now, the energy for each pair (q13 and qi) is U =k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4e² k)/2 = 2 e² k.

So for 12 pairs: 12 *2 e² k =24 e² k.

So, compute 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e(9-38) = (22.985) * 1e-29 =2.2985e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.2985e-28 =55.164e-28 →5.5164e-27 J.

So, that's 5.5164e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both the energy from the 13th charge and the mutual energy between the 12. So perhaps the mutual energy is 0.5 * 12 * U_avg, where U_avg is the average potential per pair. But without knowing U_avg, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th and the 12.

But then why is the result not matching any option? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check.

Wait, k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So, (2e) is 3.204e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2 is (3.204e-19)^2=10.269e-38 C².

So, 24 *8.988e9 *10.269e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.269e-38 = (8.988 *10.269) *1e-29.

8.988 *10=89.88, 8.988 *0.269≈2.409 → total ≈92.289.

So, 92.289e-29 =9.2289e-28.

Multiply by 24: 9.2289e-28 *24=221.5e-28 →2.215e-26 J.

Hmm, which is about 2.215e-26 J, which is option B:2.822e-26. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 8.988e9 *10.269e-38.

8.988e9 → 8.988 *1e9.

10.269e-38 →10.269 *1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 *10.269.

Let me compute that accurately.

8 *10=80.

8 *0.269=2.152.

0.988 *10=9.88.

0.988 *0.269=0.266.

So, 80 +2.152 +9.88 +0.266 = 80+2.152=82.152+9.88=92.032+0.266=92.298.

So, 92.298 → 92.298 *1e9 *1e-38 =92.298e-29 =9.2298e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 *9.2298e-28=221.515e-28=2.21515e-26 J.

Which is approximately 2.215e-26 J.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the 12, without considering that each pair is counted once.

Wait, no, no. Each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th once, so 12 pairs. So, the calculation is correct.

But the result I get is 2.215e-26 J, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option B:2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * 8.988e9 * (2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, no, the distance is 2 m, so each U is k*(2e)^2/(2).

Ah, wait, perhaps the problem states that each charge is at 2 m from P, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the distance is 2 m, correct.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the 13th charge is at point P, and the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are zero. But that can't be, because they are constrained at 2 m from P, so they can't be at the same point. So, their mutual distances are not zero.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. So, the energy is 24 k e².

But that gives 2.215e-26 J, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again: the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So, for each pair between the 13th charge and each of the 12, it's U = (k * 2e * 2e) / 2.

So, 12 pairs give 12 * (4e² k)/2 → 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Which is what I've been calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different constant, like Coulomb's constant with a different value. For example, sometimes k is approximated as 9e9, which would change the calculation.

Let me try using k=9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

So, compute 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, no, because (2e)^2 is 4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=10.26e-38.

So, 24 *9e9 *10.26e-38.

Compute 9e9 *10.26e-38 =9*10.26=92.34 →92.34e-29 →9.234e-28.

Multiply by 24: 9.234e-28 *24=221.616e-28=2.216e-26 J.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation points to approximately 2.215e-26 J, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P, but the mutual distances between the 12 are 2 m as well. So, all 12 charges are arranged at 2 m from P, and also each separated by 2 m from each other. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere, as the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is 6 (octahedron), I think.

But if that were the case, then each pair of the 12 charges would be 2 m apart. So, each pair would contribute U =k*(2e)^2/(2).

So, for each pair, U = (4e² k )/(2) = 2 e² k.

The number of pairs among 12 charges is C(12,2)=66.

So, mutual energy would be 66 * 2 e² k =132 e² k.

So, the total energy would be the sum of the energy between the 13th and the 12 (24 e² k) plus the mutual energy (132 e² k).

Total U = 24 +132 =156 e² k.

Compute that.

e² k = (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So, e² k=2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

Compute 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) *1e(9-38)=23.05e-29 =2.305e-28.

Multiply by 156: 2.305e-28 *156 =358.38e-28=3.5838e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 3.58e-26 J, which is not matching any option.

But perhaps the mutual distances are larger, leading to a lower mutual energy. But without knowing, this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and the mutual energy is zero, which can't be. So perhaps the answer is option B: 2.822e-26.

But according to my calculation, it's 2.215e-26, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of the energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, but using a different distance. For example, perhaps the distance is 2 meters from each other, not from P.

Wait, no, the problem states that the 12 are at 2 m from P. So, the distance between the 13th charge and each is 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from the 13th, but arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges in a specific configuration, like a point charge surrounded by others in a specific arrangement. But without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the minimum energy is zero, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by k=8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =2.566 *8.988=23.05 → 23.05e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.05e-29 *24=553.2e-29=5.532e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.53e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27. No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2).

Wait, (2e)^2=4e².

So, 24 * (4e² *k ) / (2 *2 m) → wait, no, the distance is 2 m, so denominator is 2 m.

Wait, no, each pair (13th and qi) contributes U =k*(2e)(2e)/(2 m).

So, 24 * [k*(4e²)/(2 m)].

So, 24 * [ (4e² k) / (2 *2 m) ) ].

Wait, no, 2m is 2 meters, so it's 24 * [ (4 e² k )/(2 *2) ].

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 m. So, 24 * [ (4 e² k )/(2) ] =24 *2 e² k =48 e² k.

Wait, no, no. U =k*q1*q2/r.

So, each pair contributes U =k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = (4 e² k)/(2 m) → 2 e² k/m.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 m, so r=2 m.

So, U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e) ) / 2 m = (4 e² k )/(2 m) → 2 e² k/m.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The r is 2 m, so it's (4e² k)/(2 m) → 2 e² k /m.

But wait, m is 2 meters, so it becomes 2 e² k /2 = e² k.

So, each pair contributes e² k.

So, 12 pairs → 12 e² k.

Ah, this is the mistake I made earlier! I forgot to divide by the distance properly.

So, let's correct this.

Each pair's energy is U =k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = (4 e² k)/(2 m) = 2 e² k/m.

Wait, but m is 2 m, so 2 e² k / (2 m) = e² k/m. Wait, no. Wait, 2 m is the distance, so r=2 m.

So, U = (4 e² k) / (2 m).

Wait, but 2 m is the distance, so r=2 m.

So, U = (4 e² k )/(2 m) = 2 e² k / m. But m is 2 m, so 2 e² k / (2 m) = e² k/m.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recompute.

U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) → (4 e² k )/(2 m) → 2 e² k / m.

But m is 2 meters, so it's 2 e² k / (2 m) = e² k/(m).

But m is 2 meters, so m=2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the units. Let me compute it numerically.

Compute U = (k * (2e)^2) / (2).

Because r=2 m.

So, U = (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 =10.26e-38.

So, 8.988e9 *10.26e-38 = 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2 → 4.615e-28.

Each pair contributes 4.615e-28 J.

Multiply by 12 → 12 *4.615e-28 =55.38e-28 →5.538e-27 J.

So, that's about 5.538e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27 is higher.

Wait, but 5.538e-27 is not an option, but option C is 7.056e-27.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

U per pair = (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m).

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) =3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 =10.26e-38 C².

m is 2 meters.

So, U = (8.988e9 *10.26e-38) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.26e-38 = let me compute the exponents first.

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

10.26e-38=10.26*1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients:8.988 *10.26 ≈92.25.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So, 92.25e-29 →9.225e-28.

Divide by 2 →4.6125e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 →4.6125e-28 *12=55.35e-28 →5.535e-27 J.

So, 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. It looks like the correct calculation gives approximately 5.535e-27 J, but none of the options match exactly. However, option C is 7.056e-27, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2√2 meters from P, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different distance, but the question states 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and also the mutual energy between the 12. So, the mutual energy would be calculated as the sum over all 66 pairs. But without knowing the exact distances, it's impossible to compute accurately.

However, perhaps the mutual energy is zero, which isn't possible, but perhaps the problem is designed that way. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual energy is considered as zero, making the total energy just 5.535e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but the calculation is done correctly as 5.535e-27 J, which rounds to 5.535e-27, approximately 5.54e-27 J. The closest option is C:7.056e-27, but that's 7.056e-27, which is 27.5% higher.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is about five times higher than my calculation. But I can't see why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me compute it accurately.

(2e) =3.204e-19 C.

(3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 =10.265616e-38 =1.0265616e-37 C².

So, 8.988e9 *1.0265616e-37 = 8.988e9 *1.0265616e-37.

Compute 8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

1.0265616e-37=1.0265616 *1e-37.

Multiply the coefficients:8.988 *1.0265616 ≈9.23.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-37=1e-28.

So, 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2 (because r=2 m) →4.615e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12 →55.38e-28 →5.538e-27 J.

So, again, about 5.538e-27 J.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find an error in the calculation. Therefore, I'll conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are arranged such that each is at 2 m from the 13th, but the mutual distances are much larger, making their mutual potential energy negligible. So, the total energy is approximately 5.538e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at 2 m from the 13th, but also considering that the 12 charges form a structure where each is at a distance of 2 m from the others. But that's impossible for 12 points.

In conclusion, based on my calculations, the correct energy should be approximately 5.538e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation steps, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

Compute U = (9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2) / (2 *2).

(3.204e-19)^2 =10.26e-38.

So, 9e9 *10.26e-38 =92.34e-29 →9.234e-28.

Divide by (2 *2)=4 →9.234e-28 /4 =2.3085e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12 →27.702e-28 →2.7702e-27 J.

Hmm, which is 2.77e-27 J, still not matching any option.

Wait, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is 10 times higher. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Maybe the distance is 0.2 m instead of 2 m? That would make the energy 10 times higher.

But the problem states 2 m, so that's not the case.

I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a decision. Based on the calculations, the closest option to the computed value is option C:7.056e-27. However, my calculation gives 5.53e-27 J, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26, but I can't find a mistake in my calculation to reach that value.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system, which includes the energy between the 13th charge (fixed at point P) and each of the 12 charges constrained at 2 m from P. The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is not explicitly considered due to the lack of information about their exact arrangement.

### Key Parameters:
- **Charge of each particle**: \( q = 2e = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- **Coulomb's constant**: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)
- **Distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges**: \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \)
- **Number of pairs between the 13th charge and the 12 charges**: \( 12 \)

### Energy Between the 13th Charge and Each of the 12 Charges:
The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
\[
U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
\]
For each pair between the 13th charge and one of the 12 charges:
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2 \cdot k}{2}
\]
Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{4 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9}{2}
\]
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{4 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9}{2}
\]
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{9.226 \times 10^{-28}}{2} = 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
\]

### Total Energy for 12 Pairs:
Since there are 12 such pairs:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot 4.613 \times 10^{-28}
\]
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
