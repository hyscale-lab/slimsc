Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different.

The setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when the potential energy (½kA²) is converted into kinetic energy. So, ½mv² = ½kA², which leads to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But this is for the classical case, and the question is relativistic, so I can't just take that.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's also related to total energy, which includes rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is gamma times mc², and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, how does this apply to the harmonic oscillator? The potential energy in relativity might be a bit different. Or maybe the system is still considered such that the total energy is the sum of rest energy, kinetic, and potential? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider the energy of the oscillator and set it equal to the total energy. In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (classically) is ½kA². But relativistically, perhaps the energy isn't just that. No, wait, maybe the potential is still ½kx², but when velocities are significant compared to c, the kinetic energy can't be treated classically.

Wait, but the question says it's a relativistic oscillator. So perhaps we should apply relativistic mechanics equations. So the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and the total mechanical energy (which includes potential and kinetic).

Wait no, that's not right. The rest mass energy is mc², and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is E_mech. So the total energy E_total is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but I'm not sure how that ties into the oscillator's energy.

Alternatively, maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total mechanical energy (E) is (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

At maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is at its minimum (since v=0). So at that point, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no. Wait, wait. At x = A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is just the potential energy. So E = ½kA². But the total energy is also the same as when the oscillator is at x=0, where velocity is maximum. So, at x=0, the potential is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E = (gamma -1)mc². But E is ½kA², so we can set them equal.

So,

½k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so let's write that:

½k A² = ( [1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2)] - 1 ) m c².

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for v_max.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(½)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = (½ k A²) / (m c²) + 1.

Let me write it as gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yeah, because ½k A² is E, so E = (gamma -1 ) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (E)/(mc²) = 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let’s call it a for simplicity. So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + a).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1+a)^2.

Rearranging,

v_max^2/c² = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

Hmm, let me compute 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 as:

[ (1+a)^2 - 1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a² = a(2 + a).

So,

v_max^2/c² = [a (2 + a)] / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can manipulate the equation another way.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

gamma = 1 + a, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = [ (k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ] / ( 2 m c^2 )

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write down v_max in terms of gamma.

Wait, from gamma, we have:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + a.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1+a)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+a)^2:

1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] = [ (1+a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2a + a² - 1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a (2 + a).

Denominator is (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure where this leads. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as:

(2a + a²) = a (2 + a) = a ( (a + 2) ), so,

v_max = c * sqrt[ a (a + 2) ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

= c * sqrt( a(a+2) ) / (1+a).

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express in terms of a.

Wait, let me write everything in terms of a:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ a (a + 2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this differently. Let's try to write the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: a(a + 2) = a^2 + 2a.

Denominator: (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

Hmm, maybe we can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's see:

Numerator: a^2 + 2a = a(a + 2).

Denominator: a^2 + 2a +1 = (a +1)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ a(a+2) ] / (a+1)^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt[ a(a+2) ) ] / (a + 1).

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified.

Let me compute a + 2 = (a + 1) + 1.

But not sure. Let's write the expression under the square root:

[a(a+2)] = [ (a+1 -1)(a +1 + 1) ) ] = [ (a+1)^2 -1 ].

So,

sqrt( a(a+2) ) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ).

Wait, so,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1).

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 ).

Hmm, let's see:

Wait,

sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1) = sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 ).

Wait, let me compute:

sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (a+1 - 1)(a+1 + 1) ) = sqrt( a (a + 2) ), which brings us back. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 )) --> Not sure.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) )) --> Hmm, not matching.

Option D: sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, let me think about another approach. Let's get back to the equation we had earlier.

We have,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ), so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Which is,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 )/( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Square both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m^2 c^4 )/( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m^2 c^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - 4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Let me compute the numerator:

(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 = [4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] -4 m^2 c^4.

Simplify:

= 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Factor out k A^2:

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator:

(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe we can factor numerator:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ?

Wait, no, because in the expansion, it's (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So, the numerator is 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4, which is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Wait, but the denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2. Hmm.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Wait that's 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

So,

= [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / denominator.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as:

[k A^2 (something) ] / (something else)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

But the numerator is k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing an obvious simplification here. Maybe it's easier to express in terms of a.

Let me set a = k A^2/(2 m c^2 ), as I did earlier.

So,

a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → k A^2 = 2 a m c^2.

Substituting into the expression for v^2/c^2:

v^2/c^2 = [ (2 a m c^2 ) (2 a m c^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (2 a m c^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Factor 2 m c^2 in numerator and denominator.

Numerator of the big fraction:

(2 a m c^2 ) * [ 2 m c^2 (a + 2) ].

So,

= 2 a m c^2 * 2 m c^2 (a +2) = 4 a (a +2) m² c^4.

Denominator:

(2 m c^2 (a + 1 ))^2 = 4 m² c^4 (a +1 )^2.

So, putting it together,

v^2/c^2 = [4 a (a +2) m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 (a +1 )^2 ) ].

The 4, m² c^4 terms cancel, leaving:

v^2/c^2 = [ a (a + 2) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Which brings us back to the same point as before.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (a +2) ) / (a +1 ).

Hmm, I wonder if this can be simplified further.

Let me compute a +2 as (a +1 ) +1. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of 1/ something.

Wait,

sqrt( a (a +2) ) = sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 ).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a +1)^2 -1 ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Wait, that's because sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1 ) = sqrt( 1 - [1/(a+1)^2] ).

Because,

(a+1)^2 -1 = (a+1 -1)(a+1 +1 ) = a (a +2 )

So,

sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( a (a +2) )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a(a +2) ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( [a(a+2)] ) / (a+1 )

Wait, but earlier I thought that [ a(a +2) ] = (a+1)^2 -1, which it is. So,

sqrt( [a(a+2)] ) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1 )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(a+1)^2 ] )

Hmm, that's interesting. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(a+1)^2 ] )

Let me substitute a = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

a +1 = [ k A²/(2 m c^2 ) ] + 1 = [ k A² + 2 m c² ]/( 2 m c² )

Therefore,

1/(a+1) = (2 m c² )/( k A² + 2 m c² )

So,

1/(a+1)^2 = [ (2 m c² )^2 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

= 4 m² c^4 / ( (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [ (k A² + 2 m c^2 )^2 ] )

Which we can write as,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Which simplifies to,

v_max = c * sqrt( [k^2 A^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +4 m² c^4 -4 m² c^4 ] ) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

= c * sqrt( k² A^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 ) / (k A^2 +2 m c^2 )

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

= c * ( A k sqrt( k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ) / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look back at the options to see which one fits.

Looking at the options again:

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which can be rewritten as,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/( ( (2 m c^2) +k A² )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 )

= c * sqrt(1 - [ (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]^2 )

Wait, that seems different from our expression. Let me compute what I have.

From earlier, we have,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(a +1 )^2 ] )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Wait, that's because,

sqrt(1 - x^2 ) = sqrt( (1 -x)(1+x) ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute 1 - [2 m c^2/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )]^2.

So,

1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ].

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which gives numerator:

(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2.

= (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2.

Factor out (2 m c^2 )^2:

= (2 m c^2 )^2 [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ]

Expand inside the brackets:

(1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )) -1.

= 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 )

= (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let's think about comparing with the options.

Earlier, we have,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [ (2 m c² )/(2 m c² + k A² ) ]^2 )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( ( (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c² )^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 ) (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor numerator inside the square root:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) = A k sqrt(4 m c^2 +k A^2 )

But this isn't matching any of the options.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: v_max= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² ))^2 )

Which would be,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² )) ]^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Wait, no. Let me compute the inside:

1 - [1/(1 + a )]^2 where a is (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

= [ (1 +a )^2 -1 ] / (1 +a )^2.

= [1 +2a +a² -1 ] / (1+a )^2.

= (2a +a² )/(1+a )^2.

Which is,

= a (2 +a )/(1 +a )^2.

Hmm, that's the same expression we had earlier for v_max^2/c^2.

Wait, so,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) )/(1 +a )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( (kA²/(2 m c² )) ( 2 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )) ) / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps this can be written in terms of the options.

Option A is sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m ))^2 ) )

Wait, but in our case, the denominator inside the sqrt is (1 - ... ), so not sure.

Option D: sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (kA²/(2 mc^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is,

sqrt( [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2 ), where a = kA²/(2mc^2 )

Which is,

sqrt( (2a +a² )/(1+a )^2 )

Which is,

sqrt(a(2 +a )) / (1 +a )

Which is exactly what we have for v_max/c.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a(2+a ) )/(1 +a )

Which is the same as,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ) ] ) / ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Simplify numerator inside the sqrt:

= k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) )

So,

sqrt( k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) )

= A k sqrt( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

So,

v_max = c * [ A k sqrt( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Simplify denominator:

[ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

So,

v_max = c * [ A k sqrt( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

The (2 m c^2 ) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

v_max = c * [ A k sqrt( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * [ A k / sqrt(2 m c^2 ) ] / sqrt( 2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can write the denominator as sqrt( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) ) = 2 m c^2 +k A^2.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the expression we have is the same as option D.

Wait, let me re-express option D:

Option D: v_max= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is the same as,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + a )^2 -1 ] / (1 + a )^2 ), where a = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2a +a² )/(1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

Which is exactly what we have for v_max.

So, the correct option is D. Therefore, the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and its mechanical energy, which includes both kinetic and potential energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Relations**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At maximum velocity \( v_{\text{max}} \), all energy is kinetic. Thus, we equate the total energy at \( x = A \) to the relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the above equation gives:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with the Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
