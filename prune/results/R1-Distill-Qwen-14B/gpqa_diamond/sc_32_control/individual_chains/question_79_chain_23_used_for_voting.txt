Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I think that's a type of acid catalysis. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common catalyst, like a base maybe? Or perhaps it's a phase-transfer catalyst? Or could it be involved in some kind of ring-opening reaction?

Wait, another approach: the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation? Or maybe an elimination reaction? Hmm. Let me think about the starting material and the product.

Compound X has the formula C11H12O. The options are all epoxides, it seems. Let me check the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure-wise, that would have an oxirane ring (epoxide) attached to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a vinyl benzene, so the substituent is at the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl and attached to the oxirane. The substituent's structure is like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2?

Wait, no: 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be (Ph)C=CH2 group attached to the oxygen? Wait, maybe it's (Ph)C-CH2-O-? Hmm, not sure. Let me draw this. The propenyl would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, 1-propen-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-Ph? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-, but the 1 indicates the double bond starts at C1. So, substituent would be CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, it's a group like (Ph)CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, perhaps I should think more about the structures.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the oxirane (epoxide) has substituents at positions 2 and 3. Position 2 is a methyl group, and position 3 is a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the structure would be like oxirane ring with CH2CH2 groups, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, the substituent is a styryl group attached to the epoxide. Styryl is a benzene ring attached to a vinyl group, so maybe it's something like O-CH2-C6H4-CH2, but I'm not exactly clear.

Now, the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (I think it's a base, maybe used in epoxide ring-opening reactions or some kind of elimination). But wait, the reaction is at 403 K, which is about 130°C, so perhaps it's a thermal reaction. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but this catalyst is a base, so perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. But wait, the product's NMR data suggests the product is an epoxide, because looking at the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at δ 197.7. That's a very high shift, which might correspond to an epoxide oxygen-bearing carbons. Alternatively, could it be a carbonyl or something else? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70 ppm, but I might be wrong. Wait, no, maybe that's a ketone. Wait, 197.7 is more like a carbonyl carbon. Hmm, that's confusing. So the product has a carbonyl group? Or perhaps it's an epoxide.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let's think about the NMR data given.

1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s): probably a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like O or adjacent to something deshielded. Or maybe a CH3 adjacent to an oxygen in a ring, like an epoxide.

δ 2.31 (3H, s): another methyl, maybe a substituent on a benzene ring, like a para-methyl group.

Then, the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's a bit unusual. Let me count the peaks: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 protons. Hmm, a benzene ring with substituents that give this pattern.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

We have carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 (probably CH3 groups), and several carbons in the aromatic region. Also, 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon—like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or maybe an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually lower, around 60-70. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl, but that would mean the product has a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction condition is with a base. So perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide, leading to some carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but the catalyst is a base. Hmm, perhaps the conditions are for an elimination, like creating a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form a carbonyl group. That doesn't quite make sense. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. One is at 2.28 and another at 2.31. Both are singlets, so no neighboring Hs. So perhaps they're attached to electronegative atoms, like oxygen in an epoxide or ketone.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the product has a ketone group. So, perhaps the starting material was an epoxide, and the reaction converted it into a ketone.

But wait, what's the starting material? The options are all epoxides. So, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening followed by elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are with the base. So maybe the base is deprotonating something, leading to a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack. If the solvent is nonpolar, maybe the base is deprotonating something to form an enolate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide derivative, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's look at the 1H NMR. The aromatic signals are as follows:

- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, four peaks in the aromatic region. Let's analyze their splitting. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. Let's imagine a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the integration, 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, perhaps making a di-substituted or tri-substituted benzene.

Wait, maybe the aromatic region is from a 1,2,4-substituted benzene. For example, a para-substituted group and perhaps another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent, like a vinyl group. So, for example, a para-methyl group and a meta-vinyl group? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, perhaps the doublets are part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group attached to the benzene. So for a vinyl group attached to a benzene, the protons on either end of the double bond would couple with each other and with any adjacent protons.

Wait, but in a styrene (vinyl benzene), the vinyl protons are typically around δ 5-6. But in this case, the signals are around 6.75 to 7.71, which is higher, so perhaps there's some conjugation or an electron-withdrawing group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a para-substituted styrene. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4 and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is a methyl group and another is a vinyl group. Let me think: the 2H doublets could be from the aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents para to each other, each with a proton that's split into a doublet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider the options and see which one fits the NMR data.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So this would have an epoxide group where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is attached to a styryl group. So the structure would be something like O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-O. Wait, no, more accurately, it's an epoxide with a styryl substituent. So the structure would be a three-membered ring (epoxide) attached to a styryl group.

The product after reaction would be something else, but the NMR is of the product. Wait, no, the question says the product is from the reaction of compound X. So the product is the result of X reacting with the base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide, but with a base. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, like the base abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and formation of a double bond. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the product is a diene or styrene.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl group. Hmm. So perhaps the epoxide ring opened to form a carbonyl.

So, if X is an epoxide, and upon reaction with the base, it undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl. Let me imagine that.

Epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically involves nucleophilic attack. But without a strong nucleophile, maybe it's a different mechanism. Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation or some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a position adjacent to the epoxide, making a carbonyl via elimination.

Wait, for example, imagine an epoxide where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons has a hydrogen that can be abstracted by a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, the structure would be something like:

O
||
C-O-C-R

And if R has a hydrogen adjacent to one of the carbons in the epoxide, the base could abstract that hydrogen, leading to the ring opening and the formation of a carbonyl.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group, which would match the 13C NMR peak at 197.7.

Now, looking back at the 1H NMR: the two methyl singlets around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm. These are likely to be CH3 groups attached to something electronegative, perhaps adjacent to oxygen or carbonyl groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the product is a ketone with two methyl groups attached. Let me see.

Wait, in the 13C NMR, the carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 are both singlets, so they are each attached to only one carbon (like CH3 groups).

So, perhaps the product is a substituted cyclohexanone or something similar, but more likely, it's a ketone with substituents.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl carbon, likely a ketone. So the product is a ketone with some aromatic substituents.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the starting material (X) is an epoxide, and the reaction converts it into a ketone.

Wait, but the options are all possible structures for X. So, the product is the result of X undergoing a reaction. The question is to identify X based on the product's NMR.

Wait, maybe I should think about what reaction occurs when an epoxide reacts under these conditions. Since the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong base, perhaps it's a ring-opening via an SN2 mechanism. But without a good leaving group, that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

Wait, another thought: if the epoxide ring opens to form a carbonyl, perhaps via a neighboring group participation. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a good leaving group, but in this case, maybe it's a simple epoxide with a substituent that can form a carbonyl upon ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? No, those typically require heat and specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, which involves 1,2-diols under acidic conditions, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's for carbocation shifts.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a hydrogen, the base could abstract it, leading to ring-opening and formation of a carbonyl.

So, the epoxide structure would have two adjacent CH2 groups. Let me imagine an epoxide like CH2-O-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3 or something similar. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the product's NMR, let's try to assign the signals.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has four doublets. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with some substituent. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group attached to the benzene.

But the aromatic signals sum up to 6H, which is a benzene ring, so the substituents would be at specific positions.

Wait, let me think: for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para-substituted), the protons on the ring would be equivalent, but that might not fit the NMR data here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,3-disubstituted benzene, leading to a triplet of doublets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the 13C NMR. The aromatic carbons are at 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s). So, that's a total of 8 aromatic carbons? No, wait, C11H12O has 11 carbons. Let me count:

Product's 13C NMR:

- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Total: 9 carbons. But the molecular formula is C11H12O. Hmm, perhaps I've missed some carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps the product's formula is C11H12O. So, 11 carbons. The NMR shows 9 carbons, so maybe two carbons are part of the epoxide or another group. Wait, but the product's formula isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product has a carbonyl group (197.7 ppm), two CH3 groups (21.3 and 28.4), and several aromatic carbons. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So, the product has a ketone group (197.7), two CH3 groups (maybe at different positions), and a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, maybe the product is something like 4-methylbenzophenone, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl vinyl ketone attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows two singlets for CH3 groups. Let's say one is attached to the carbonyl (COCH3), and another is a para-substituted methyl on the benzene.

So, perhaps the structure is something like (4-methylphenyl) methyl ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzalacetone or similar.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the reaction again.

The reaction is between compound X (an epoxide) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day.

Under basic conditions, an epoxide might undergo ring-opening. But in the absence of a strong nucleophile, perhaps the ring-opening is via an elimination mechanism, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, if X is an epoxide with a substituent that can form a carbonyl upon ring-opening, the product would have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is a base-induced elimination, leading to a carbonyl.

So, the structure of X (the starting material) should be such that upon ring-opening, a carbonyl is formed.

Looking at the options, which are all epoxides, perhaps the correct structure of X is such that when the epoxide opens, a carbonyl is formed.

So, for example, if X is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-adjacent carbons has a hydrogen that can be abstracted by the base, leading to ring-opening and formation of a carbonyl.

Let me imagine X's structure. Let's say X is a substituted epoxide, maybe something like a cyclohexene oxide with substituents. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a substituted styryl epoxide. So, when the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, the ring opens, and the double bond forms, creating a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at each option and see what their structures would lead to in terms of the product.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is attached to a vinyl group, which is further attached to a para-methyl benzene.

So, structure: O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? No, wait, it's styryl, which is C6H4-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is C6H4-CH=CH2. So, in option A, the epoxide is attached to a 4-methylstyryl group. That would be O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps O-C-CH2-C6H3(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached. So the structure would be O-C-CH2-C6H3(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps the styryl is CH2-Ph-CH2, but with a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe it's O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH2? I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3, but I'm not certain.

In any case, upon reaction with the base, how would this epoxide behave? If the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, the ring would open, and perhaps form a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's structure and the possible product.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl attached. So the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2? Or perhaps O-C-CH=CH-Ph?

Wait, the substituent is (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), which is (Ph)C=CH2-O-C. So the oxirane ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a double bond to a phenyl group.

So, the structure would be O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

If this epoxide reacts under basic conditions, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and forming a carbonyl.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group attached to the same carbon as the CH2 group.

So, the product would be something like O=C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

Wait, but that would form a ketone. Let me see if that matches the NMR data.

In the 1H NMR, the signals would include the two CH3 groups (if any), and the aromatic protons.

But in the product's NMR, there are two singlets for CH3 groups. So perhaps the product has two methyl groups.

Wait, in the product, if the starting material was option B, upon ring-opening, would a methyl group form? Hmm, perhaps not. Because option B's substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is (Ph)C-CH2-O-C.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a carbonyl group, and the two CH3 groups in the product come from the starting material.

Wait, the starting material's formula is C11H12O. If the product's formula is C11H12O, perhaps the reaction didn't change the number of carbons, just the structure.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps X is an epoxide that upon ring-opening forms a ketone.

Let me think about which option would give that upon ring-opening.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, the structure is an epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached.

If the epoxide is O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3, no, that's not quite right. Wait, 2-styrylepoxide would be O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3. No, maybe it's O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the product's 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. Let's say these are attached to oxygen or some other electronegative group.

So, in the product, perhaps one methyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon (COCH3) and another is a para methyl on the benzene ring.

So, the structure would be something like (4-methylphenyl)-CO-CH2-CH3. No, that would have more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the product is (4-methylphenyl)propanone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-methylacetophenone. Its structure would be (4-methylphenyl)-CO-CH3. That has a ketone group, a methyl group on the benzene, and a methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

That would fit the NMR data:

- The two singlets: one for the COCH3 (around 2.1 ppm) and one for the benzene's para methyl (around 2.3 ppm).

But wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31, which are both around 2.3 ppm. So, a COCH3 would be around 2.1-2.3 ppm, and a para methyl would be around 2.3 as well.

So, the two singlets would correspond to the COCH3 and the para methyl.

In that case, the aromatic region would have a para-substituted benzene. So, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets: one for the two protons meta to the substituent, and another for the two protons ortho to the substituent.

Wait, but the aromatic signals in the product's NMR are:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, that's four signals. Let me think. If the structure were 4-methylacetophenone, the benzene would have a substituent (COCH3) at position 4 and a methyl group at position 4 as well? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 4. Or perhaps it's a vinyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-methylbenzyl methyl ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the structure would have an epoxide ring with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Upon ring-opening, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to a carbonyl group.

If the epoxide is between carbons 2 and 3, and one of the adjacent carbons has a methyl group, opening the ring could form a carbonyl.

So, the reaction would convert the epoxide into a ketone, giving a structure like (CH3)(CO)CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a carbonyl group adjacent to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which option, when reacted, would produce a product with two methyl groups, a carbonyl, and a benzene ring with substituents that match the NMR.

Looking back, the product has a carbonyl (197.7 ppm) and two CH3 groups. Let's say one CH3 is attached to the carbonyl (COCH3) and another is attached to the benzene ring (para position).

So, the structure would be something like (4-methylphenyl)propanone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzophenone derivative with a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR shows a triplet for the aromatic protons or not? No, all are doublets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the 13C NMR doesn't show a carbonyl that low (about 190-205 for aldehydes).

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is more in line with a ketone than an aldehyde.

So, the product is likely a ketone.

Putting this all together, perhaps the starting material (X) is an epoxide that, upon ring-opening under basic conditions, forms a ketone with two methyl groups and a benzene ring.

Looking at the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure would be O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is the carbonyl carbon. The two CH3 groups are at 21.3 and 28.4.

If the product is (4-methylphenyl)propanone, the structure would be:

CO-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3 (para position).

But that would give a 13C NMR with a carbonyl around 208 ppm. Hmm, but the product's is 197.7, which is lower than expected for a ketone. Wait, maybe it's a different substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclohexanone derivative with a benzene ring attached.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of signals in the 1H NMR. The product has 6 aromatic protons, which suggests a benzene ring with substituents that don't cause splitting beyond doublets.

Wait, another idea: the product's aromatic region shows four doublets. That might indicate a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with each substituent having protons that couple with adjacent protons.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a para-substituted benzalacetone, but I'm not certain.

Let me try to think of which option would produce the given NMR data upon reaction.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. If this epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl group, perhaps the product would have a carbonyl adjacent to a benzene ring.

In that case, the structure would be something like (Ph)CH2COCH3. That would mean the product has a benzene ring, a CH2 group, a carbonyl, and a methyl group.

So, looking at the NMR data:

- 1H NMR: the two singlets (2.28 and 2.31) would correspond to the methyl group on the benzene (para) and the methyl group on the carbonyl (COCH3).

- The aromatic protons would be from the benzene ring. If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. For example, the ortho protons would be at higher δ (around 7.7 ppm), and the meta protons at lower δ (around 6.75 ppm).

So, the 1H NMR might show something like δ 7.71 (2H, d) for the ortho protons, and δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d) for the meta and para protons. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but in the product's 1H NMR, there are four signals: 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. That could correspond to a di-substituted benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 4-methylacetophenone, which has a methyl group on the benzene and a COCH3 group. But then the aromatic protons would be in a para pattern, possibly leading to two doublets integrating to 2H each.

But the product's NMR shows 6 aromatic protons, which is expected for a benzene ring (assuming no equivalent protons). So, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each integrating to 2H, and one set integrating to 2H for the ortho protons. Wait, but that would be three signals, not four.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should make a table of the possible structures and their expected NMR signals.

Let me think about option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure of X (option D): O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3 (but I'm not certain). Upon reaction, ring-opening forms a carbonyl group. The product would have a structure like O=C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3. That would be a ketone, with the benzene ring having substituents.

The 1H NMR of the product would then have:

- The two CH3 groups: one attached to the carbonyl (COCH3, around 2.1 ppm) and one attached to the benzene (para, maybe around 2.3 ppm).

- The aromatic protons would be split into doublets based on their position relative to substituents.

In this case, the benzene substituents are at positions where the ring has substituents that lead to four different sets of protons, hence four signals.

Alternatively, the product could be 4-(2-oxopropyl)styrene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the integration of the aromatic signals. The product's 1H NMR shows 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So the benzene ring has four unique protons. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that break the symmetry of the ring, leading to four distinct protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the benzene has two substituents, leading to four unique protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a 2-methyl-1-phenylethyl ketone. No, I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the product's structure is (E)-4-methyl-3-buten-2-one. Wait, but that's a straight chain, not aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzalacetone, like 3-phenyl-2-butanone. So, structure would be CH2-CO-CH2-C6H5. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is the ketone. Then, the other carbons are the CH3 groups and the benzene.

In any case, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide, which upon reaction forms a product with a ketone group, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring with substituents matching the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the 13C NMR data.

The 13C NMR of the product has a peak at 197.7, which is a ketone. So the product is a ketone.

Thus, the starting material must be an epoxide that, upon ring-opening under basic conditions, forms a ketone.

Looking back, option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which would have the structure O-C-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH3. Upon ring-opening, perhaps the adjacent CH2 group becomes a carbonyl, leading to a structure like (C6H4-CH2-CH3)COCH3.

Wait, no, that would require more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (C6H4-CH2)COCH3, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Its structure is O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

Upon ring-opening with the base, the adjacent CH2 group loses a proton, leading to a carbonyl. So the product would be O=C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

But that structure would have a carbonyl and a vinyl group. That might fit.

The 1H NMR would then have:

- The CH3 groups: but wait, in this product, are there any CH3 groups? The starting material (option B) has a propenyl group with a phenyl, so the product would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and a vinyl group.

Hmm, but the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for CH3 groups. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-C6H3(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Upon ring-opening, perhaps it forms a ketone with a methyl group on the benzene.

So the product would be (4-methylphenyl)propanone. That would give the two CH3 groups (COCH3 and benzene's CH3) and the aromatic protons.

In that case, the 1H NMR would have the two singlets for the methyl groups and the aromatic protons as four doublets.

The 13C NMR would have the carbonyl at 197.7, the two methyl carbons around 21 and 28 ppm, and the aromatic carbons as per the data.

So, perhaps option A is the correct starting material, leading to the product described.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Upon ring-opening, the product would have a ketone group, a methyl group on the epoxide, and a styryl group.

But again, I'm not certain.

After this lengthy thinking, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide, leading to a product with a ketone group and the described NMR data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day. The reaction conditions suggest a base-induced transformation, likely involving epoxide ring-opening or elimination. The product's NMR data provides critical clues about its structure.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for methyl groups, likely attached to electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen or carbonyl).
   - Aromatic region: δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d). Four signals indicate a benzene ring with substituents that break symmetry, leading to four distinct aromatic protons.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, likely from a ketone.
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons.
   - Aromatic carbons: δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s), δ 141.5 (1C, s), δ 144.1 (1C, s).

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group (vinyl benzene with a para methyl group).
- Reaction: Base-induced ring-opening could form a ketone. The product would have a carbonyl group, a methyl group on the benzene (para position), and a methyl group attached to the carbonyl.
- Fits the NMR data: Two methyl singlets (21.3 and 28.4 ppm), aromatic protons consistent with a para-substituted benzene, and a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm.

#### **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group (vinyl benzene with a propenyl chain).
- Reaction: Base-induced ring-opening could lead to a carbonyl group, but the product would lack the two distinct methyl groups observed in the NMR data.
- Does not fit the NMR data: The product would not have two singlets for methyl groups.

#### **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.
- Reaction: Base-induced ring-opening could form a ketone, but the product would likely have a different arrangement of substituents on the benzene ring, inconsistent with the NMR data.
- Does not fit the NMR data: The aromatic region and methyl signals do not align with the observed data.

#### **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene).
- Reaction: Base-induced ring-opening could form a ketone. However, the product would lack the two distinct methyl groups observed in the NMR data.
- Does not fit the NMR data: The product would not have two singlets for methyl groups.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data strongly supports a product with a ketone group, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring with substituents that match the observed splitting patterns. Among the options, **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)** is the most consistent with the NMR data, as it can undergo a base-induced ring-opening to form a ketone with the described structure.
