Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all of which are very small distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like decay length L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity in terms of the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but wait. I also recall that for a resonance, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the actual formula uses Γ in the denominator, right? So τ is inversely proportional to Γ.

Let me think. The mean lifetime τ for a particle is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. So I can compute τ using that.

But first, I need to compute β and γ for the particle. Since the particle is a meson, it's a boson, probably neutral, but that's not directly relevant here. The energy given is the production energy, which I think is the total energy of the particle. So E_X is the total energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So E = γ m c². So γ would be E / (m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, I have to be careful with the units.

Wait, I need to calculate γ. Let me jot down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So γ = E_X / (m_X c²). But wait, in units where c=1, E = γ m for a particle. So γ = E_X / m_X = 8 / 1.2. Let me compute that: 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so approximately 6.6667.

So γ is 6.6667. Now, β can be found using the relation β = sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))). Let me compute that. So 1/(γ²) is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 8 / 1.2 is exactly 6.666666... So γ is 20/3, since 20/3 is 6.666... So (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/(gamma squared) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So βc is about 0.9887c.

Wait, but more accurately, let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think, 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775. Let me compute that: 0.9887 * 0.9887. 0.98 *0.98 is 0.9604, 0.0087 *0.98 is about 0.008526, but wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator isn't possible, but given that 0.9887² is approximately 0.9775, that's correct. So β is around 0.9887. 

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in GeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s? Because ħ c is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the units.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, Γ is in GeV, so τ = ħ / Γ. Let me compute that.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. So 6.582 /0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is γ * β * c * τ. Let me plug in the numbers.

γ is 6.6667, β is 0.9887, c is approx 3e8 m/s.

So L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, multiply all the constants:

6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that. 6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322. 0.6667 *0.9887≈ 0.6589. So total approx 5.9322 +0.6589 ≈6.5911.

So 6.5911 *3e8 = 1.97733e9 m/s.

Wait, no: 6.5911 multiplied by 3e8 is 6.5911 *3=19.7733, so 19.7733e8 m/s is 1.97733e9 m/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm supposed to multiply all that by τ, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 1.97733e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.97733e9 by 2.056875e-24.

1.97733e9 *2.056875e-24 = 1.97733 *2.056875 *1e-15.

Compute 1.97733 *2.056875: Let's approximate.

1.97733 *2 = ~3.95466.

1.97733 *0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1121.

So total approx 3.95466 +0.1121=4.06676.

So L ≈4.06676e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 1.97733 *2.056875.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1.97733 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 1.97733 * 2 = 3.95466.

1.97733 * 0.056875:

0.056875 is 56875e-7.

So 1.97733 *56875e-7.

Let me compute 1.97733 *56875 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.97733 * 0.056875.

0.056875 is approximately 5687.5e-6.

So 1.97733 *0.056875 = 1.97733 × 0.056875.

Computing 1.97733 * 0.056875:

Let me compute 1.97733 × 56875 = but wait that's 56875 is 0.056875 when divided by a million.

Alternatively, let me compute 1.97733 * 0.05 = 0.0988665.

1.97733 * 0.006875 = ?

0.006875 is 6875e-6. So 1.97733 *0.006875 = approx 0.013555.

So adding 0.0988665 +0.013555 = 0.1124215.

So total is 3.95466 +0.1124215 =4.0670815.

So 4.06708e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *1e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, so my approximate calculation gives about 4.067e-15 m, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me go back. The decay width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 /0.32 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Then, velocity factor: beta is sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)). Since E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. Correct.

Then, gamma is E/(m c²) → E and m are in GeV, so in natural units (c=1), gamma is 8/1.2=6.6667.

So, decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887, product is 6.5911.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.5911 * 3e8 =1.97733e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.97733e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97733 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Calculating 1.97733 *2.056875: Let me compute this more accurately.

1.97733 × 2.056875.

Let me compute it as (2 - 0.02267) × (2 + 0.056875) → but perhaps a better way is to calculate it step by step.

Alternatively, 1.97733 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 1.97733*2=3.95466.

1.97733 *0.056875 = ?

0.056875 is 9/160. So 1.97733 *9 =17.79597, divided by 160: 17.79597 /160 = 0.111225 approx.

So 3.95466 +0.111225=4.065885.

So 4.065885e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \) is the velocity factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \) is the proper lifetime,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant.

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The speed of light \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting into the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):

\[
L = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = (6.6667)(0.9887) \approx 6.5911
\]

Then, calculate \( \gamma \beta c \):

\[
\gamma \beta c = (6.5911)(3 \times 10^8) \approx 1.97733 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = (1.97733 \times 10^9)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
