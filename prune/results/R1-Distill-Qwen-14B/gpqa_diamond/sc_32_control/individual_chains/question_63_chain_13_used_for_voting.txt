Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model, and it's in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational states. So the molecule's total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state. But how does that transition happen? Oh, right, when a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

But wait, what's the specific scenario here? The molecule is in its fundamental state. So, what's the next state? I think the next state would involve either a change in vibrational state or a rotational state. But since the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy," I'm guessing it's the first excited state, which might involve a change in vibrational quantum number, because vibrational energy is higher than rotational.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are quantized with both n (vibrational) and l (rotational) quantum numbers. The fundamental state is the lowest vibration (n=0) and the lowest rotation (l=0 or l=1?).

Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy depends on l, where l is an integer greater than or equal to 0. But the selection rules say that during a vibrational transition, rotational states can change by ±1. So if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, l=0, perhaps), absorbing a photon could cause it to go to the next state, which might be n=1 (vibrational excitation) and maybe l=1 (rotational excitation).

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state of both vibrations and rotations. So to find the energy difference between the current state (n=0, l=0) and the next state, which is the first possible higher energy state.

But what's the next state? The next possible higher energy state would be either increasing n by 1 (n=1) or l by 1 (l=1), whichever has a lower energy difference. Hmm. Or perhaps the total energy is a combination of both, so the next state would be the first excited energy level, which could involve either a change in n or l. But in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So E_vib would be (n + 1/2) ħω, and E_rot would be (l(l+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the question is about the fundamental state, meaning n=0 and l=0 perhaps. So the next state could be either n=1 and l=0, or n=0 and l=1. Which transition requires less energy? Let's compute both.

E_vib for n=1 is (1 + 1/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. E_rot for l=1 is (1*(1+1) ) ħ²/(2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Alternatively, E_vib for n=0 is (0 + ½) ħω = ½ ħω, and E_rot for l=1 is as above. So the energy difference between n=0, l=0 and n=0, l=1 would be E_rot (l=1) - E_rot (l=0) = ħ²/(2I) (since l=0 gives 0). Because E_rot(l=0) is zero.

Alternatively, the energy difference between n=0, l=0 and n=1, l=0 would be E_vib(n=1) - E_vib(n=0) = (3/2 - ½) ħω = ħω.

So which is smaller, ħω or ħ²/(I)? I need to compute both.

Wait, but in reality, vibrational energy is usually higher than rotational energy for diatomic molecules. Because the vibrational frequency ω is typically on the order of 1e13 to 1e14 rad/s, while rotational energy depends on I, which is larger for heavier atoms.

Wait, but let's compute the values. Given the data: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, bond length R=2 angstroms, ω=4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but the mass to calculate the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So first, compute μ. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Then, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, compute the energy differences.

E_vib for n=1: (3/2 - 1/2) ħω = ħω. ħ is h/(2pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So E_vib = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

E_rot(l=1) is (l(l+1) ħ²)/(2I) - 0. So (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/I. ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J²·s². Divided by I (1.2e-46 kg m²) gives ħ²/I ≈ 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.17e-23 J. So E_rot is about 9.17e-23 J.

Wait, but E_vib is about 4.2e-20 J, which is much larger than E_rot of 9e-23 J. So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is much higher. So, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the l=1 rotational state, since that requires less energy.

Wait, but wait. When does the rotational state transition happen? Because in some cases, the molecule can change rotational state while changing vibrational state. But the selection rules for vibrational transitions usually allow Δl = ±1. So if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, l=0), upon absorption of a photon, it can go to n=1, l=0 (vibrational) or n=0, l=1 (rotational) or even n=1, l=1 (both). But the question is asking for the lowest possible energy, which would be the transition that requires the least energy.

So between the two possible transitions (vibrational or rotational), the rotational requires less energy. So the photon should have energy equal to the energy difference for the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the energy levels are a combination of both, and perhaps the next state is a combination of n=0, l=1, which would be lower in energy than n=1, l=0. But I'm a bit confused because in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are separate, so the total energy is the sum of both. So the energy levels aren't necessarily ordered in a simple way, but the fundamental state is (n=0, l=0), and the next possible higher states would be either (n=1, l=0), (n=0, l=1), or (n=1, l=1). The energies of these states would determine which is the next lowest.

Wait, let's calculate the energies for each.

E(n=0, l=0) = E_vib(0) + E_rot(0) = (½ ħω) + 0 = 0.5 ħω.

E(n=1, l=0) = ( (3/2) ħω ) + 0 = 1.5 ħω.

E(n=0, l=1) = (½ ħω) + E_rot(1) = 0.5 ħω + ( (2) ħ² )/(2I) ) = 0.5 ħω + ( ħ² )/( I )

E(n=1, l=1) = (3/2 ħω) + ( (2) ħ² )/(2I) ) = 1.5 ħω + ( ħ² )/( I )

So the next state with the lowest energy would be whichever of E(n=0, l=1) and E(n=1, l=0) is lower.

Wait, but I have to compute which is smaller: 0.5 ħω + (ħ²/I) versus 1.5 ħω.

So compute E_rot(1) = ħ²/(I). Let's compute the numbers.

Earlier, I found I ≈ 1.2e-46 kg m².

ħ² is (1.05e-34 J·s)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J² s².

So E_rot(1) = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

E_vib for n=1 is 1.5 ħω: ħω is 1.05e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.2e-20 J. So 1.5 * 4.2e-20 = 6.3e-20 J.

So E(n=0, l=1) is 0.5 * ħω (which is 2.1e-20 J) + E_rot(1) (9.17e-23 J) ≈ 2.1e-20 + 0.00917e-20 ≈ approximately 2.1e-20 J.

E(n=1, l=0) is 6.3e-20 J.

So E(n=0, l=1) is much lower than E(n=1, l=0). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is n=0, l=1.

So the energy required is the difference between E(n=0, l=1) and E(n=0, l=0), which is E_rot(1) = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the next state after the fundamental state may involve only a change in the rotational state. Because if the molecule is in the (n=0, l=0) state, the next state with the lowest energy is (n=0, l=1), which requires energy E_rot(1) = 9.17e-23 J.

But then, the photon must supply that energy. So the photon's energy must be equal to E_rot(1) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm. Because photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum (since photons are massless, their energy is E=pc). So p = E / c.

So if the photon's energy is 9.17e-23 J, then p = 9.17e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.056e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, no, wait. The energy of a photon is E = h f = pc. So p = E / c.

So E_rot(1) is 9.17e-23 J.

p = 9.17e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.056e-31 kg·m/s. That's 3.056e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the moment of inertia calculation.

Let me recalculate I. μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 m². (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

Then, ħ^2 / I: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ^2 is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

So E_rot(1) = (ħ²) / (2I) ? Wait, no.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (l(l+1) ħ²) / (2I). For l=1, that's (2 * ħ²) / (2I) ) → ħ²/(I).

So E_rot(1) = ħ^2 / I → 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

So photon energy E = 9.24e-23 J. Then, p = E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 → 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but the options are way larger than that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational state is the first excited state (l=1). So the energy difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = 9.24e-23 J.

But the options are of the order 1e-27 N·s, which is 1e-27 kg·m/s. My calculation gives 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, l=0) to the next state, which is (n=1, l=0), but that would require the vibrational energy. Let me compute that.

Energy difference for vibrational transition: E = ħω.

ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

E = 1.05e-34 *4e14 = 4.2e-20 J.

Photon's momentum p = E/c = 4.2e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s → 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition would require less energy, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, if the rotational energy is 9e-23 J, which is much larger than the vibrational transition of 4.2e-20 J? Wait no, wait, 9e-23 is 9 *1e-23, and 4.2e-20 is 4200 *1e-23. So 4.2e-20 is much larger than 9e-23.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 4.2e-20 is 0.042e-18, while 9e-23 is 9e-23. So 4.2e-20 is larger than 9e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one.

Hmm, but in that case, the photon's energy would be 9.17e-23 J, so p=3e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are that small. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (l=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1), keeping l=0. That would require E = ħω = 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy of E_rot(1). Let me recompute it.

E_rot(1) = (l(l+1) ħ²) / (2I) = (2 * (1.05e-34)^2) / (2 * 1.2e-46 )

Wait, I think that's where I made a mistake. Let me recalculate E_rot(1):

E_rot = [ l(l+1) * ħ² ] / (2I )

For l=1, it's [ 2 * (1.05e-34)^2 ] / (2 * 1.2e-46 )

So the 2 in numerator and denominator cancel.

E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46.

Which is (1.1e-68) / 1.2e-46 = approx 9.17e-23 J.

So that's correct.

But that tells me that the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon should have 9.17e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c =9.17e-23 /3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg m/s → 3.06e-31 N s.

But none of the options are this small. The options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which is (n=0, l=0). Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Which state would that be?

Looking at the possible energy levels, the next state would be the one with the lowest energy above the current state. So the next state could be either (n=0, l=1) or (n=1, l=0). Whichever has lower energy.

As calculated earlier, E(n=0, l=1) is about 2.1e-20 J, while E(n=1, l=0) is 6.3e-20 J. So the next state is (n=0, l=1), which requires an energy of 9.2e-23 J.

But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 N s → which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s. E = pc → 1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

B) 2.3e-27 → E=6.9e-20 J.

C)1.1e-27 → 3.3e-20 J.

D)1.4e-28 →4.2e-20 J.

So the only way that any of these options make sense is if the photon's energy is E = ħw =4.2e-20 J, which matches option D.

But why? Because earlier calculation suggested that the next state is (n=0, l=1), which requires lower energy than (n=1, l=0). So why is the correct option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition?

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering whether the next state is (n=0, l=1) or (n=1, l=0). Wait, perhaps the model being used is only considering the rigid rotor, which doesn't include the vibration. No, the question states the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the combination of (n=0, l=1). But why would the photon's energy correspond to the rotational energy? Because according to the calculations, the energy required for the rotational transition is much lower than the vibrational.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for the next state with the lowest energy, but in reality, the vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational. So the next state would be the first vibrational excited state (n=1, l=0), which is a higher energy than (n=0, l=1), but maybe the selection rules only allow certain transitions.

Wait, but what are the selection rules for the rotation-vibration model? For vibrational transitions, the Δn = ±1, and Δl = ±1, 0. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change n by ±1, and l by 0, ±1.

So if the molecule is in (n=0, l=0), it can transition to (n=1, l=0), (n=1, l=1), or (n=0, l=1). The energies of these states would determine which is the next lowest.

Wait, but (n=0, l=1) is lower in energy than (n=1, l=0), as previously calculated. So the next state would be (n=0, l=1), which requires E_rot(1) =9.2e-23 J.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot(1). Let me recompute E_rot(1):

I = μ R². μ = (20 *2)/(22) amu = (40)/(22) ≈1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = about 3.02e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

E_rot(1) = ħ²/(2I) * l(l+1) → for l=1, 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So E_rot(1) = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p_photon= E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s →3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, which would have E_photon=4.2e-20 J, p=1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

But why is that the case? Oh wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the rotational energy levels are quantized, and for the molecule to change its rotational state, it might require a different type of transition. Or perhaps in this model, the next state is the first vibrational state, ignoring the rotational transition, but that doesn't make sense because the rotational transitions are usually much lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering vibrational transitions, which would make the choice D.

Wait, the question says non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So the total energy is the sum. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (n=0, l=1), which requires a photon of 9.2e-23 J, which is about 3e-31 kg m/s. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy in terms of w, which is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, let's compute E_rot(1) again.

E_rot = (l(l+1) ħ²) / (2I)

But perhaps I can express I in terms of R and μ. I = μ R².

So, E_rot = (2 * ħ²) / (2 μ R²) ) = ħ²/( μ R² )

So E_rot = (ħ²) / (μ R² )

Given: μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg → μ= (40/22) * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) *1.66e-27 → 3.02e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So E_rot = (1.05e-34)^2 / (3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Wait, denominator: 3.02e-27 kg * (4e-20 m²) = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.1e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈9.1e-23 J.

Again, same result.

So the photon's energy is 9.1e-23, p= 3e-31. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotation, just vibration. But the question states that it's modeled by the non-rigid rotor model, which includes rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is the (n=0, l=0), and the next state is (n=0, l=1). Thus, the energy required is E_rot =9.2e-23 J, but the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me check that.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) ) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state, which is the sum of vibrational and rotational changes.

But that complicates it further. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the energy of the first excited state of the vibration, which would be E_vib = ħω.

So the photon's energy is ħω, which is 1.05e-34 *4e14 =4.2e-20 J. p=4.2e-20 /3e8 =1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

So perhaps the question expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

But why?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (n=1), regardless of the rotational state. So the energy difference is ħω.

But wait, that would imply that the rotational state is still l=0, which may not be allowed by the selection rules for vibrational transitions. Because during a vibrational transition, the rotational quantum number can change by ±1 or 0.

But if the molecule is in (n=0, l=0), upon absorbing a photon, it can go to (n=1, l=0), (n=1, l=1), or (n=0, l=1).

But the energy required for (n=0, l=1) is less than (n=1, l=0), so that would be the next state, but the options don't match that.

Another possibility: The question may have a typo, and the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot.

Wait, let me compute E_rot using the formula E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) l(l+1).

So for l=1: E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibration model only, ignoring rotation. Then, the energy difference is ħω, leading to option D. But the question says to model it as a non-rigid rotor, which includes rotation.

Wait, another thought: In the non-rigid rotor model (which is sometimes called the rotation-vibration model), the energy levels are given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The ground state is n=0, l=0.

So the first excited state would be the one with the next lowest energy. It could be either (n=0, l=1) or (n=1, l=0), whichever has lower energy.

As calculated, (n=0, l=1) is lower in energy. So the energy required is 9.2e-23 J.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is considering only vibrational transitions, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the selection rules. Maybe the selection rules for vibrational transitions require that the rotational quantum number change by ±1, so the molecule would transition to (n=1, l=1). But that state has higher energy than (n=0, l=1), so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from (n=0, l=0) to (n=0, l=1) as the next state. But again, that leads to p=3e-31, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in units where the calculation is done with different constants. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute E_rot again.

E_rot = (l(l+1)ħ²)/(2I).

For l=1, E_rot = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) → ħ²/I.

So let's compute ħ²:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I= μ R² = ( (20 *2)/(20+2) ) * (1.66e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, let me compute I in another way.

I = (20 * 2)/(22) amu * (1.66e-27 kg/amu) ) * (2e-10 m)^2.

So, 20*2=40, 40/22≈1.818.

1.818 *1.66e-27 kg =3.018e-27 kg.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.207e-46 kg m².

So E_rot =1.112e-68 /1.207e-46 ≈9.21e-23 J.

p = E_rot / c =9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational energy, leading to 4.2e-20 J, and p=1.4e-28 kg m/s. Which is option D.

So I'm confused why the problem would expect that, but perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Another approach: The question asks for the momentum of the photon to switch to the next state. What's the next state? The next state could be the first excited vibrational state (n=1, l=0), which requires E= ħω.

So, p = ħω / c = (1.05e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (4.2e-20)/3e8 =1.4e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the molecule using the non-rigid rotor model. The total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:

\[
E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega
   \]  
   The energy difference for a transition from \(n=0\) (ground state) to \(n=1\) (first excited vibrational state) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar\omega
   \]  
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})(4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{l(l+1)\hbar^2}{2I}
   \]  
   For \(l=1\) (first excited rotational state), the energy difference from \(l=0\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   The moment of inertia \(I = \mu R^2\), where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass and \(R\) is the bond length.  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]  
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):  
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]  
   - Bond length:  
     \[
     R = 2 \, \text{\AA} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
     \]  
   - Moment of inertia:  
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \times 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]  
   - Rotational energy difference:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:  
   The vibrational transition requires \(4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\), while the rotational transition requires \(9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it corresponds to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by \(E = pc\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]  
   However, none of the provided options match this value. If we instead consider the vibrational transition, the momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the vibrational transition is being considered, as the rotational transition momentum does not align with the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
