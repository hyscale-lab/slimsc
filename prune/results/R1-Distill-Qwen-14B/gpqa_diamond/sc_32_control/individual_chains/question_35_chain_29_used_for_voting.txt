Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let's try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my angular momentum stuff, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So, let me write that down.

First, I need to figure out what Ay looks like. So, c is h/(4π), and S is:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, multiplying c by each element of S would give Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]
Which is:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
       [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Hmm. Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, I remember that to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, let me write out the matrix Ay - a I:

[[ -a, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
 [ i*(h/(4π)), -a ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ].

Calculating that: a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, what's (-i)*(i)? Let's compute that. i * i is -1, but it's multiplied by (-i) so (-i)*(i) = - (i^2) = - (-1) = 1.

Wait no, wait. Let's compute (-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i times i is i² = -1. So, (-i)*(i) = -i² = -(-1)=1.

So, the determinant becomes a² - [ (1) * (h/(4π))^2 ] = 0.

So, equation: a² - (h²)/(16 π²) )= 0.

Which gives a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option A: It says the imaginary part are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues I found are real, right? Because the operator is hermitian, so the eigenvalues must be real. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. Because taking the complex conjugate of -i gives i, so S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian. So Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, which makes Ay Hermitian. Thus, its eigenvalues must be real.

But the options don't seem to have any options with real eigenvalues. Let me look again.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But wait, we just saw that the eigenvalues are real, so this can't be right. So option B must be wrong.

Option A suggests eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be correct because they're real. So options A and B are out.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let's think. For angular momentum operators, [A², A_x] = 0, so eigenfunctions of A² are simultaneous eigenfunctions of any of the components, right? But wait, this is for the total angular momentum. The question is about a single component (A_y), and the system is spin-½, muon. So for spin ½ particles, the square of the angular momentum is s(s+1)ħ², where s=½. So A² would have eigenvalues (½)(½ +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². But I'm not sure if the eigenvectors of A_y are also eigenvectors of A². Wait, generally, for angular momentum, the total A² commutes with each component, so if φ is an eigenstate of A_y, then it is also an eigenstate of A². So option C says it can be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But can it be an eigenfunction of Az? Well, in general, for a state that's an eigenstate of A_y, it won't be an eigenstate of Az because the components don't commute. So the first part of option C is correct, the second part is correct as well. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, I'm not sure what this means. The basis functions of the operator are probably the eigenvectors, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is true for any set of eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator in its own eigenbasis. But the matrix Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form a basis for the 2D space. So whether φ are the basis functions of Ay... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the other options again. Since I've concluded that the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π), so any option that includes imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect. So the correct answer must be either C or D.

Looking back at option C, it says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with all components, any eigenstate of A² is a state with definite A² and any component. Wait, no. Wait, if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, and since [A², A_y]=0, then that state is also an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. As for Az, since [A_y, A_z]=iħ A_x, the eigenvectors of A_y are not eigenvectors of Az because they don't commute. So, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not exactly sure what 'basis functions' mean here. If the φs are the eigenvectors, then yes, they form an orthonormal basis (assuming they are orthogonal). So the matrix representation in this basis would be diagonal. So D would be correct, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me read the statement again: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what 'basis functions of the matrix operator' means. Perhaps the matrix is expressed in the eigenbasis of Ay. Well, any matrix can be expressed in any basis, but the eigenbasis would make the operator diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis, but the question is whether D is a correct statement during the calculation.

So, in my calculation, the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, which statement is correct during the calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So, the correct answer is option C. Let me double-check that.

To recap: The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² (since [A², Ay]=0), but not of Az (since [Ay, Az] ≠0). So indeed, option C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Substituting \( A_y \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} 
-a & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -a 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(-i \cdot i\right)\left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = a^2 - \left(-(-1)\right)\left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), we solve:

\[
a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0 \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. This eliminates options **A** and **B**, as they suggest imaginary parts in the eigenvalues, which is incorrect.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors and Option **C**
The operator \( A_y \) is Hermitian because \( S \) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is real. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. For angular momentum operators, \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning that eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes the statement in **C** correct.

### Step 3: Option **D**
Option **D** states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D space, the phrasing of **D** is unclear and less precise than the statement in **C**, which is directly supported by the properties of angular momentum operators.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).
