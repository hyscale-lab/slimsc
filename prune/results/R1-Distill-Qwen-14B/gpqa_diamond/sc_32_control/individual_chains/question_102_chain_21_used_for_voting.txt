Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some vectors and transfection into primary astrocyte cultures, then looking at the expression in mice.

So, the main issue is that when they look for the green signal (eGFP) under the confocal microscope, they don't see anything. The construct has a ligand and receptor with some fluorescent tags. Let's go through the setup step by step.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Between ligand-mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor-eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, this sounds like a system where Cre recombinase would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, the vector is lox-Cre, so when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites. So the ligand and receptor would be expressed. But in the experiment, the eGFP signal isn't there.

They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in a Western blot after transfection, and the actin loading is correct. So the expression is being checked with other methods, but the fluorescence isn't showing up. So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed properly.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes or other glial cells.

But the offspring don't show green fluorescence. So what's wrong? The eGFP is part of the receptor construct. So either the receptor isn't being expressed, or the eGFP isn't being tagged correctly.

Looking at the vector setup: The ligand is under CBA promoter, then the ORF for ligand with mCherry, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then the IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF. The receptor is fused to eGFP but has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after it. Wait, no, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. Or is the stop upstream of the eGFP? Wait, the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP. So the stop is between the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, I think I need to get the structure right. The vector is bicistronic, so it has two genes. The first is ligand with mCherry, but is blocked by a stop cassette. The second is receptor with eGFP, also blocked by another stop cassette. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are not expressed because the stop cassettes are in place.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the lox sites. The ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed.

But wait, the lox sites differ. The ligand's stop cassette is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. Cre can recognize both, but do they recombine correctly? Oh, right, the Cre used in these systems is typically for loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant that can be used with the same Cre. Or wait, maybe in this case, the Cre used can only recombine certain sites. Oh wait, the vector is lox-Cre, meaning that the Cre is under a loxP site? Or is it a vector that requires Cre to excise the stop cassettes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The vector has two stop cassettes. The ligand is in the 5' ORF, followed by loxP-stop-loxP. The receptor ORF is at 3' with a lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So, when Cre is introduced, it can recombine loxP sites but not lox2272, unless a different Cre variant is used. Or wait, is it the other way around? No, the standard Cre works with loxP sites. Lox2272 is a variant that can be used with a modified Cre, perhaps, but in standard Cre-ex systems, only loxP sites are recombined. Wait, no, actually, lox2272 is another variant where Cre can still recombine. Wait, I'm not too sure. Let me recall. The Cre recombinase can recognize different lox sites, but sometimes you might need a different Cre variant for certain lox types. Alternatively, the lox2272 is a lox site that is recognized by Cre, but perhaps requires a longer stretch or has a different arrangement.

Wait, but in this case, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the Cre is under a loxP site, and when Cre is expressed, it will excise the loxP-stop-loxP cassette in the ligand's part, but for the receptor's stop cassette, which is lox2272, Cre might not be able to excise it, meaning the receptor ORF remains blocked. So the ligand would be expressed (since the loxP sites are cut), but the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the lox2272 sites aren't cut.

But wait, the Cre is introduced via the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest cells. The lox-Cre vector has the loxP sites, so when Cre is present, it excises the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor ORF remains blocked. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed, hence no eGFP. That would explain the lack of green fluorescence.

But wait, why would the ligand express but not the receptor? Because the ligand's stop uses loxP sites, which Cre can cut, but the receptor's uses lox2272, which Cre can't. So in that case, the ligand would be expressed (so mCherry would be visible if they looked for red), but the receptor wouldn't be expressed, so no eGFP (green).

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That's about whether the ORF is correctly spliced. But the question setup says the vector is a bicistronic vector, each with their own stops. So if the stop is correctly excised, they should be in frame.

Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would relate to protein trafficking, but the problem here seems more about expression. The Western blot wouldn't show the protein if it's stuck in Golgi, but the question says that the Western blot uses total proteins, so if the protein is made but stuck, it would still be present in the lysate. So the blot should pick it up, but maybe it's not being expressed.

But the ligand's expression is under the CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is strong and constitutive. So the ligand may be expressed, but the receptor may not be, if the stop cassette isn't removed.

Wait, but the vector has the receptor after an IRES. So the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF, but only if the stop cassette is removed. So without Cre, the ligand and receptor are both blocked. With Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's stop isn't (if Cre can't do lox2272), so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be there.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So why no eGFP?

Another possibility: the vector is set up such that Cre is required to remove both stop cassettes. But if the stop cassettes are different, perhaps only one is excised. So if the ligand's stop is loxP, and the Cre can't cut the lox2272, then only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor.

But the question is about the absence of green signal, which is from eGFP linked to the receptor. So it's likely that the receptor isn't being expressed. So why?

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by the Cre used. The Cre in the vector is standard, so it may not recognize lox2272. So the stop cassette for the receptor remains, preventing its expression.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would relate to how they function, not their expression. So probably not the reason for no green signal.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. But the Western blot would still detect the protein, I think. The question says the blot uses total proteins, so presence in Golgi shouldn't affect the signal. Unless the eGFP isn't being expressed at all.

Option C: Enhancer for ligand and receptor missing. If the enhancer is missing, they wouldn't be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong and constitutive. So maybe the enhancer for the receptor is missing? But the vector is designed with the IRES, which is a promoter-independent way to start translation.

Wait, another angle: the IRES element is between the ligand and receptor. So after the ligand ORF, the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor ORF. But only if the stop cassette is removed. So if the stop cassette isn't removed (because Cre didn't cut it), the receptor isn't expressed.

So, considering the vector setup, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which requires the stop cassette to be removed for the receptor to be expressed.

But if Cre isn't able to excise the stop for the receptor, the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, eGFP isn't made, so no green signal.

So why would the Cre not be able to excise the lox2272 sites? Because the Cre used may not recognize lox2272. If the vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor, and the Cre used in the mice is standard (loxP-specific), then the ligand's stop is excised, but the receptor's stop isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

But the question states that the vector is a lox-Cre vector. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the vector setup. Let me think again. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the vector itself has a lox site, and the Cre is introduced elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed such that Cre is expressed only when in the presence of a certain promoter. Or maybe the vector has a floxed (loxP) stop cassette before the Cre. So when Cre is present, it excises, allowing the Cre to be expressed, which then goes on to excise other stops.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's structure is that the ligand and receptor are under the control of different lox sites. So for the ligand, the stop is flanked by loxP, and for the receptor, by lox2272. When Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre mice), it can only excise the loxP sites, not the lox2272. Therefore, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

So the lack of green is because the receptor isn't being expressed. Which would point to the lox2272 sites not being cut by Cre, which can only cut loxP.

Looking at the options, the question is why the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So the reason is because the stop cassette isn't excised.

But none of the options directly state this. Let me read the options again.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, but the vector is designed so that the ORF is in frame. So probably not.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't required. The receptor is under IRES, so perhaps the enhancer isn't needed there either.

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor won't be expressed. But then why was the Western blot done? Oh, the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocytes, but the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the IRES doesn't work, but in the mice, Cre is supposed to enable expression.

Another possibility: the IRES is only functional in certain cell types. But SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, so perhaps the IRES works there.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because of a stop codon. Like, the stop cassette remains, preventing the receptor from being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, meaning the stop remains, so the receptor is not expressed.

But the options don't directly state this. Looking at the options again, which one fits?

Option D suggests that receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP would be incorrectly tagged, but the protein would still be expressed, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional or truncated protein. But the Western blot would still detect it if the antibody recognizes the overexpressed protein.

But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so if the proteins are overexpressed, the blot would show signals. But in the mouse, the expression isn't happening.

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't properly excising the stop cassettes because the Cre isn't active in the cells. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells. So the construct should be active.

Alternatively, maybe the vector's design is such that without both stop cassettes being excised, neither the ligand nor the receptor is expressed. But that doesn't make much sense because the ligand is under a strong promoter and its stop is under loxP.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the lox2272 stop cassette prevents the IRES from functioning, so even if the ligand is expressed, the receptor's expression is blocked.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the results. The Western blot after transfection showed signals proportional to actin, so presumably, the expression was checked. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the expression isn't happening in the mouse for some reason.

But the problem is about the vector design leading to no eGFP expression. So the likely reason is that the receptor isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So, the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 sites. Which means the vector's design has the receptor's stop under lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

So the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by the Cre, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't present, leading to no green signal.

Looking at the options, which option would correspond to this scenario?

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. But that's about trafficking, not expression.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, but the vector should have them in frame.

Wait, another possibility: The vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. The Cre used can only cut loxP, so the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the answer would be that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, but this isn't one of the options. So perhaps the correct reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised.

Wait, the options don't directly address the Cre's ability to cut the sites, but perhaps option D is about the ORF not being correctly excised, leading to the eGFP not being expressed.

Alternatively, option C says the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. IRES elements are supposed to initiate translation without a promoter in certain contexts. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed. But why would that happen in the mouse but not in the transfected cells? Or maybe in the transfected cells, the IRES works, but in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening because the stop isn't removed.

Alternatively, the vector might not have the IRES properly positioned. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses a 'lox-Cre' system, meaning that the Cre is expressed when the lox sites are present. But perhaps the vector is designed so that the Cre is only expressed when the loxP sites are present, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the vector could be a dual recombinase system. But probably not.

Hmm, maybe I should look for which option corresponds to the inability to express the receptor. The options are:

A) ligand and receptor in paracrine: not about expression.

B) stuck in Golgi: affects localization.

C) enhancer missing: affects expression.

D) not in frame: affects expression.

If the stop cassette isn't cut, the receptor isn't expressed. So option C, which says the enhancer is missing, could be the case. But the ligand is under a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't needed. Alternatively, the receptor might require a certain enhancer which isn't present.

Wait, the vector's receptor is under the control of the IRES, so maybe the enhancer isn't required, but the problem is the stop cassette not being cut. Since the options don't directly address this, I have to choose the best fit.

Another thought: when Cre is introduced, it excises the stop cassettes. If the vector's design requires both cassettes to be cut for both the ligand and receptor to be expressed, but only the ligand's is cut, then the receptor isn't expressed.

So the reason for no eGFP is that the receptor's stop isn't cut, meaning the construct isn't excised properly. But the options don't directly state this.

Wait, looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. How would that happen? If the ORFs are not in frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. But the vector design should ensure that the ORFs are in frame, as it's a bicistronic vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed for the ligand to be in frame with mCherry, and the receptor to be in frame with eGFP, but due to the stop cassettes, they're not. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the way. For example, the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but the stop is in between. So when Cre cuts, the ligand and mCherry are in frame. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But if the stop isn't cut, the ORF might be misaligned. So perhaps the lack of Cre activity leads to the ORFs being out of frame, causing no expression.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't properly designed for the IRES to work with the lox2272 sites. So the IRES is followed by the receptor ORF but a stop, which isn't excised, so the IRES doesn't function, and the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, I'm not certain.

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would result in a nonfunctional protein, but the Western blot might detect it if the antibody recognizes the overexpressed part. But in the mouse, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP prevents their expression, meaning that the eGFP is not being made. So the problem is that the stop isn't being cut, leading to no eGFP.

Wait, but why wouldn't the stop be cut? Because the Cre used can't recognize lox2272. So that would mean that the lox2272 cassette isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

But the options don't directly address this.

Wait, think about the vector: The ligand is at 5', with a stop under loxP. The receptor is at 3' with a stop under lox2272. The IRES is between them.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the loxP stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor remains under the stop, so it's not expressed.

So the reason is that the stop for the receptor isn't being excised because Cre can't recognize lox2272. So why isn't the eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't cut, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So the answer would be that the ligand and receptor are not co-expressed because the stop for the receptor isn't excised, but the options don't directly state this.

Wait, looking at the options again, option A says the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells, but the construct would likely be for autocrine or paracrine signaling, but that doesn't explain the lack of eGFP expression.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly, but the Western blot might detect the receptor without eGFP, but the question says the blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the mouse, the receptor is expressed but without eGFP, but the Western blot would detect it regardless.

But in the question, the Western blot was done after transfection, but the GFP visualization is in the mouse after crossing. So perhaps the mouse construct isn't being expressed because the stop isn't cut, leading to no eGFP.

So the reason is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 sites, so the receptor isn't expressed. But this isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the vector has a single lox site. Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, maybe the vector has a lox-P site that, when Cre is active, allows the expression of the entire cassette. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, another approach: The vector is a bicistronic vector with two ORFs. Each is under a stop cassette. Cre is used to excise these stops, allowing expression.

If the Cre can't excise both stops, then neither ORF is expressed. But in this case, the ligand's stop is under loxP, which Cre can cut, so the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor's stop isn't cut, so no eGFP. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but why isn't the eGFP expressed? Because the stop isn't cut, so the receptor ORF isn't open.

So the answer is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the receptor isn't expressed. But which option corresponds to this?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would impact their expression.

Alternatively, option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein is made but not trafficked to the cell surface, but the Western blot would still detect the protein.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop isn't excised, the ORF would have a stop in between, leading to a frameshift. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes are in the way, preventing the IRES from working. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by a stop. Then the IRES, then the receptor and eGFP with their own stop. So, for the receptor and eGFP to be expressed, the stop in front of them must be excised. If the stop isn't excised, the receptor isn't expressed. So this aligns with the stop not being cut.

But none of the options directly say that. So perhaps the best fit is option D: the ORFs are not in frame. Alternatively, perhaps the vector design has the ligand and mCherry in frame, but the receptor and eGFP are not, leading to no eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed even without a promoter, as it's internal ribosome entry.

After considering all this, I think the most likely reason is that the receptor's stop isn't being excised, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed. But since the options don't directly address this, the only plausible choice is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the vector uses loxP for the ligand and the same loxP for the receptor. Wait, no, the vector has loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. So the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is set up so that both stop cassettes are under loxP, but the mouse's Cre can't cut both. But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand and receptor in the same reading frame, but the stops prevent that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the stop cassettes are before the IRES. Wait, the IRES is before the receptor ORF. So without excising the stop, the IRES can't function, meaning the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, the options don't directly address this.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is the answer, but I don't see how the enhancer would be missing in the vector.

Wait, the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. The receptor uses the IRES. IRES doesn't require a promoter. So the enhancer wouldn't be a factor. So probably not option C.

So, going back, I think the most plausible answer is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't excised because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. But since this isn't an option, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design causes the eGFP to be out of frame. So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Each ORF is flanked by a stop cassette: the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. After crossing mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, under the strong CBA promoter, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette.  
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, preceded by an IRES, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  
   - Cre recombinase is expected to excise these stop cassettes, enabling expression of the ligand and receptor.

2. **Cre Activity**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice should express Cre in neural crest-derived cells, allowing excision of the stop cassettes.  
   - Standard Cre recombinase can excise loxP sites but not lox2272 sites. This means the ligand's stop cassette (loxP) would be excised, but the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) would remain intact.

3. **Expression Outcomes**:  
   - The ligand, with mCherry, would likely be expressed due to excision of the loxP stop cassette.  
   - The receptor, with eGFP, would not be expressed because the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised, preventing translation of the receptor ORF.

4. **Fluorescent Signal**:  
   - The absence of green fluorescence indicates that the receptor-eGFP construct is not expressed. This aligns with the inability of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**:  
  This describes their functional interaction but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

- **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**:  
  If the receptor-eGFP were synthesized but trafficking-deficient, it would still be detectable in the Western blot. Since the blot uses total proteins, this is unlikely.  

- **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**:  
  The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not require an enhancer. The receptor is under an IRES, which does not rely on enhancers either. This is unlikely.  

- **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**:  
  If the receptor and eGFP were out of frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. However, the vector design ensures proper framing. The more likely issue is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised, preventing receptor expression.  

### Conclusion:
The absence of green fluorescence is most consistent with the receptor-eGFP construct not being expressed due to the lox2272 stop cassette remaining unexcised. While this is not explicitly stated in the options, the best match is **D**, as it aligns with the idea that the construct is not being properly expressed.

Answer: D
