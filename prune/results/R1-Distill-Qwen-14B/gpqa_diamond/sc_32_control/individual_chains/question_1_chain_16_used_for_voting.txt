Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, with various energy values.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Right, which states that you can't precisely measure certain pairs of variables simultaneously, like position and momentum. Or in this case, maybe energy and time?

Energy-time uncertainty principle is probably what applies here. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time must be at least ħ over 2.

But wait, what's Δt here? Oh, right, the lifetime of the state is essentially the time during which the system exists before it decays or changes. So, the lifetime τ is related to the uncertainty in time Δt. I think Δt is about τ, maybe? Or perhaps the other way around, like Δt is approximately the same as τ.

So, the energy uncertainty ΔE must be at least ħ/(2τ) to distinguish the two states. That makes sense because if the energy difference is too small, the states might not be resolvable due to the uncertainty.

So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty, which is ħ/(2τ). But wait, which lifetime do we use here? Oh, because the two states have different lifetimes, we probably need to consider the shorter one. Because the state with a shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty in energy. Wait, no, wait—the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So if a state has a shorter lifetime, that means a larger ΔE uncertainty. So to resolve two states, their energy difference should be bigger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as each state having its own energy uncertainty. But since we're considering the difference between two states, perhaps the relevant uncertainty is the uncertainty in the energy difference. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, considering each state's energy uncertainty: the first state (E1) has a lifetime of τ1 = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). The second state's uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). Since we want the energy difference between E2 and E1 to be clearly distinguishable, the difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe just greater than the larger of the two? Or perhaps the sum?

Wait, no, wait. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. For this difference to be resolvable, ΔE needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. What's the uncertainty in the energy difference? Well, the energy difference's uncertainty would come from the uncertainties of each state.

So the uncertainty in ΔE = ΔE2 + ΔE1, because energy differences combine quadratically? Or add linearly? Hmm, not exactly sure. Maybe I should just think of the energy difference needing to be larger than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum.

Wait, another approach: if you have two energy levels, each with their own lifetimes, the uncertainty in each energy measurement is ΔE1 and ΔE2. To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that sum, the uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute each ΔE. First, let me find ħ. I know that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the answer options are in eV, I should convert ħ into eV·s.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So, 1 eV·s is 1.60218e-19 J·s. Wait, no, actually, ħ is already in J·s, so to convert it to eV·s, I can divide by the conversion factor.

So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So, 1 J = 1 / 1.60218e-19 eV. So, ħ in eV·s is ħ / (1.60218e-19) eV/J.

Calculating:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) = (1.0545718e-34) / (1.60218e-19) eV·s.

Let me compute that:

Approximate calculation: 1e-34 / 1.6e-19 is about 6.25e-16 eV·s. But more accurately, 1.0545718 / 1.60218 ≈ 0.658. So, 0.658e-15 eV·s.

Wait, 1e-34 / 1e-19 is 1e-15, so 0.658e-15, which is 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, back to the problem. For each state:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) eV.

Dividing 6.582e-16 by 2e-9: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly for ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) eV.

6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is 3.291e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

If we want the energy difference between E2 and E1 to be resolvable, the minimum ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7, ΔE2 is 3.29e-8. Sum is approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much less than 3.6e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7, so it's larger.

Wait, 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6, which is 0.00036 eV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, wait no, wait:

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. 3.6e-7 eV is 0.00000036 eV. So 0.0001 eV (1e-4) is much larger than 0.00000036 eV. That would satisfy the condition.

So, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than our calculated minimum.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's less than 3.6e-7.

So, the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: when the lifetimes are different, the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or perhaps it's the maximum of the two. Hmm, not sure. Because if one state has a much larger uncertainty than the other, then the overall uncertainty in the energy difference would be dominated by the larger one. But in this case, ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2.

Wait, in the calculation above, I assumed the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, but perhaps I should instead consider the maximum of the two. So, if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then it might be sufficient.

Wait, but for resolving two states, you need the separation to be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement. The combined uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties in each energy, right? Because if you have two measurements with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the uncertainty in their difference would be the square root of (ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2), due to error propagation.

Wait, error in a difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), yeah. So, in our case, ΔE_diff is the uncertainty in the energy difference. So, ΔE_diff = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) = sqrt( (3.291e-7)^2 + (3.291e-8)^2 )

Let me compute that:

(3.291e-7)^2 = approx (3.29e-7)^2 ≈ 1.08e-13.

(3.291e-8)^2 ≈ 1.08e-15.

So, adding them: 1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15 = 1.0908e-13.

Take the square root: sqrt(1.0908e-13) ≈ 3.30e-7 eV.

So, the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 3.3e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this value for them to be distinguishable.

Now, looking back at the options, the possible ΔE options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.001e-6 is 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001e-6 is 1e-9. That's way smaller. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → also way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 10000e-8, which is much bigger than 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 3.3e-7 eV is 0.00000033 eV. So, 1e-4 is much larger than 3.3e-7. So option C is sufficient.

But wait, the question asks for the energy difference between the two, which is E2 - E1. But the problem doesn't specify which is higher. So regardless of which is bigger, the absolute difference must be greater than the uncertainty.

So, the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I confused the order. The problem says E1 and E2 have lifetimes 1e-9 and 1e-8. So, E1's ΔE is larger than E2's. So, the correct way is to take the sum of the two uncertainties, which gives about 3.6e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

So, looking at options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00036e-4. So 1e-4 is way larger. So yeah, option C is the only one that works.

Wait, but wait, what about option D? It's 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00001e-4. No, that's way below the required 3.6e-7.

So, the only possible correct option is C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. The uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states, the uncertainties in energy are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2}.
\]

Given \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(3.291 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (3.291 \times 10^{-8})^2} \approx 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.30 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
