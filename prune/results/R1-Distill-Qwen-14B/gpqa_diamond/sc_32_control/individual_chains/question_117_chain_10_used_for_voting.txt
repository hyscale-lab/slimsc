Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? So, let me think about each of the given options.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I have to evaluate each one.

Let's go step by step.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   So, the structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl). The substituents are nitro groups and methyl ester groups. Wait, the substituents are in positions 2 and 2' on each benzene. Also, the nitro groups are at 6 and 6' positions. 

   Now, do these substituents create any chiral centers? Well, each benzene ring is flat, so if the substituents are symmetrically placed, the molecule might not have a chiral center. But wait, the biphenyl group can have conformational isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. For optical activity, we need a chiral center or something like a planar chirality.

   Alternatively, maybe the central bond allows for a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each benzene are symmetric, the molecule might not have a chiral center. But wait, the substituents are 2 and 2' on each ring. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate methyl ester group. Wait, the positions are 2 and 2'—so each benzene has two substituents on the same positions. Hmm, so if the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, then the molecule might be symmetric. So, maybe there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl has a certain configuration that could be chiral.

   Wait, wait. 1,1'-biphenyl means that the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are in 2 and 2' positions on each ring. So each ring has a nitro (6,6'), and a carboxylate (2,2').

   Let me draw it mentally. Each ring has two substituents: one at position 2 (carboxylate) and another at position 6 (nitro). So, each ring is symmetric with substituents at 2 and 6. Since 2 and 6 are across from each other on a benzene ring (they're para positions), each ring is symmetrical. So, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Or perhaps the biphenyl arrangement allows for a non-superimposable mirror image. But I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe it's a case of meso compounds or something else.

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each benzene are in positions that create a mirror plane. If that's the case, then the molecule wouldn't be chiral. So maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   The structure here would be a methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me write the structure: the ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl. The propanoate has three carbons, with the hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

   So, the structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but with the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

   Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Is there a chiral center here? Let's see: the central carbon (second carbon) has four different groups: an OH, a CH3 (from the first carbon), a COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, wait. Let me clarify the structure.

   The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CHOH. The groups attached to it would be: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So, yes, four distinct groups. So that central carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

   So option 2 does show optical activity.

3. **Benzophenone**
   Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone. Its structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a ketone group.

   Now, does it have any chiral centers? The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so it doesn't count as a substituent in the same way), and a hydrogen. Wait, no. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (double bond), and no hydrogen. Wait, wait: benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so the four bonds are Ph, Ph, O (double), and maybe a lone pair. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon doesn't have a hydrogen. So, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and an oxygen double bond. So, no, it's not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to O and can't have four different substituents. So benzophenone doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**
   Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two double bonds in a trans configuration. When esterified with methanol, it becomes MeOOC-CHCH-COOMe.

   In fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the substituents on each are COOMe groups. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait: butenedioic acid has four carbons. So, it's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for succinic acid, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between the second and third carbons.

   So dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group.

   Now, fumarate has a trans configuration across the double bond. Does this create any stereoisomerism? Well, in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, the two ester groups are also on opposite sides.

   So, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond. This creates a possibility for geometric isomerism (cis or trans), but geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism.

   Wait, optical isomerism is about chirality. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

   The central double bond is between two CH groups, each with a COOCH3 substituent. Each of those CH groups is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(COOCH3) on each end? Or is it CH-?

   Let me think again. The structure of fumarate ester is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe? No, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, it's MeOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOMe with a double bond. No, wait, no—fumarate is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

   So, each of the two central CH groups is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen (since the double bond is CH=CH). So each CH has the groups: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So each CH is bonded to two same groups (COOCH3 and H), a double bond, and another CH. So, each of these CH groups has only two different substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, no chiral centers here.

   Alternatively, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Since the substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, would this molecule be chiral?

   Wait another thought: maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the two substituents (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, no, because each CH has a COOCH3 and a H. So, perhaps the two ends are mirror images.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate might not have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, wait, fumarate itself is a diastereomer of maleate. So, in terms of the ester, does it have any chiral centers?

   Wait, another approach: do any of the carbons in dimethyl fumarate have four different substituents? Let's look at each carbon.

   The carbons are:

   - The two COOCH3 carbons: each is double-bonded to O and connected to OCH3. Not chiral.

   The two central CH groups: each is bonded to (a) COOCH3, (b) a hydrogen, (c) double bond to the other CH, and (d) another substituent? Wait, each CH is bonded to COOCH3, H, and two other CH's via the double bond. No, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and two other CH via the double bond. Wait, no, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, plus two bonds in the double bond.

   Wait, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and double bonded to another CH. So, each CH has two substituents and two double bonds. So, each CH is CH, meaning each has two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and two double bonds. So, each of those CH groups has the same substituents on each side. So, no, they don't have four different groups. So, no chiral centers.

   So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. So, when it's in the trans form, the substituents are on opposite sides. But that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So, dimethyl fumarate would show geometric isomerism as cis or trans, but not optical isomerism.

   Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. If the substituents on each CH are the same (COOCH3 and H), but arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, would that make the molecule chiral?

   Wait, no. Because each CH has two identical substituents, the molecule can't have a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, all four substituents must be different. If a substituent is same on both sides, then the carbon can't be chiral.

   So, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the CH groups has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, they each have two identical groups (like having two H's? No, wait, each CH has one H. So each CH has COOCH3, H, and two bonds in the double bond. So, each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. Hence, no, they don't have four different groups. Therefore, no chiral centers.

   So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I remember that fumarate is a diastereomer, but perhaps I'm conflating geometric isomerism with optical isomerism. So, dimethyl fumarate is a trans di-substituted ester, but it's not chiral.

Now, summarizing:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → No chiral center? Maybe not.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → Yes, chiral center.

3. Benzophenone → No chiral center.

4. Dimethyl fumarate → No chiral center.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake with compound 4? Let's think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: Structure is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, the two CH groups are connected by a double bond. Each CH has a COOCH3 and a H.

Wait, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and double bonded to another CH. So, each CH has only two substituents (COOCH3 and H). So, no, they can't be chiral centers.

So, the only compound with a chiral center is option 2.

Wait, but the options are combinations. Let's look at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → So, three compounds show optical isomerism.

B)3 and4 → No, I don't think either show.

C)2 and3 → Only 2 shows, 3 doesn't.

D)1 and2 → Earlier thought: 1 might not show.

Wait, but earlier I wasn't certain about 1. Let me reevaluate.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2,2', 6,6' positions. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate methyl ester at 2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because the substituents on each benzene are at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So each ring has two substituents, each para to each other. So, each ring is symmetrical. Thus, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but 1,1'-biphenyl means the two rings are connected at 1 and 1' positions. So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring (which are adjacent to the connecting position). So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 relative to the connection.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in a way that it's not chiral. Let me imagine the structure. The two benzene rings are connected at their 1 and 1' positions. On each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 (which is 4 positions away on the ring, so para). So, each ring has substituents at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro) positions. So each ring has two substituents across from each other.

So the entire molecule would have a mirror plane. Think of it: if I draw a mirror through the central bond, each substituent would have a mirror image. So, the molecule should be achiral. So, no optical isomerism here.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

So, looking back at the options:

Option A says 1,2,4 → Only 2 is correct, so this option is wrong.

Option B: 3 and4 → No.

Option C:2 and3 → 3 doesn't; only 2.

Option D:1 and2 → 1 doesn't, so wrong.

Wait, but none of the options have only 2. Looking at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, if only 2 is correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer must be an option where only 2 is included. But none of the options include only 2.

Wait, because in the question, the four compounds are 1,2,3,4. The options are combinations. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, did I make a mistake with any of the compounds?

Let me recheck each compound.

1. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, it has a chiral center.

2. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: As discussed, no.

So, only 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Because the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → three

B)3 and4 → two

C)2 and3 → two

D)1 and2 → two.

Wait, is there a mistake in my analysis?

Wait, maybe compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, what's the structure of dimethyl fumarate again? It's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The central double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH has a COOCH3 and a H.

Wait, no chiral centers because each CH has two substituents (COOCH3 and H), but perhaps the entire molecule is chiral due to the double bond's configuration.

Wait, no, because the double bond's configuration (E or Z) doesn't create a chiral center but leads to geometric isomerism. Thus, it's not optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the only correct answer is option 2. But none of the options have only 2. Wait, perhaps I'm missing another point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Could there be a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
  |
CH2-CH2
  || 
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me imagine it as CH₂(COOCH₃)–CH₂(COOCH₃) but with a double bond. So, it's CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). No, wait, no. Fumarate's structure is:

HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH is succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

So, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

The two CH groups in the center are each attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each CH is CH, not a chiral center.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the molecule being a meso compound? For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral even if there are stereocenters.

Wait, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is achiral. So, in fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, but that doesn't create a chiral center.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I missed that compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, maybe one of the oxygen atoms is bonded in such a way that it creates a chiral center.

Wait, no. The oxygen is double-bonded to C, so it's not a stereogenic center.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. But in fumarate's ester, the structure is symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

So the structure is:

Ph-(1,1')-Ph

Each Ph has substituents at 2 and 6.

So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if you imagine a plane cutting through the central bond, the substituents on each ring are mirror images.

But wait, if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, then the molecule may be symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, no, it's not a chiral molecule.

Thus, only compound 2 has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have just 2. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with another compound. Let's think about compound 4 again. What if the ester groups are in a configuration that makes the molecule chiral?

Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. Each CH has a COOCH3 and a H. So, each CH is CH, not a chiral center. So, no, it's not chiral.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another possibility. Could the molecule have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound? Like tartaric acid, which is a meso compound and thus achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate: if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, yes, it's a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an 'only 2' option. Let me look again at the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Oh! Wait, maybe in dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents on each CH are on opposite sides, but that doesn't make it a chiral center. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting about allene-type structures having chirality. Wait, allene is a conjugated diene, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, another angle: could the molecule have a center of chirality not at the carbons but elsewhere, like on a sulfur or nitrogen atom? No, fumarate is an ester with only carbons.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 has a chiral center.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I missed that compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again. Structure of dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each CH has a COOCH3 and a H. So, each is CH. No chiral centers. So, no.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake with compound 1. Could the substituents create a chiral center in the biphenyl?

Hmm, the biphenyl structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The single bond allows for rotation. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would be chiral.

But in this case, since the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule can have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the arrangement is not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring is para-substituted with nitro and carboxylate.

When connected as a biphenyl (1,1'), perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, so it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can exist in enantiomeric forms. But for that, it needs a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The question is asking which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

Based on our analysis:

1: No

2: Yes

3: No

4: No

So, only 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 1,2,4

B)3 and4 → 3 and4

C)2 and3 → 2 and3

D)1 and2 → 1 and2.

So, none of the options match 'only 2'. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps in option 4, dimethyl fumarate actually has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. If the substituents are arranged in a way that each CH has four different groups.

Wait, for example, maybe each CH is connected to the double bond, a COOCH3, a H, and another group, making it a chiral center.

Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- double bond (so, connected to the other CH)

- and another substituent? Or is it a terminal group?

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure again: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3 would be succinate, but fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- double bond (to the other CH)

But that's only three substituents. Wait, no. Each CH has:

- COOCH3 group (one substituent)

- H (second substituent)

- two bonds in the double bond, which are connected to the other CH.

Wait, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other atoms. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- double bonded to two other CH groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct myself. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two other carbons via the double bond. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- two bonds in the double bond (each bond is to the adjacent CH).

So each CH has COOCH3, H, and two single bonds to the adjacent CH. Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other atoms via the double bond. So, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-C=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOMe for succinate, but fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

So each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3

- H

- and bonds to the adjacent CH via a double bond.

Wait, but in reality, each CH is bonded to:

- COOCH3 (one substituent)

- H (second substituent)

- two other substituents via the double bond, which are the same on both sides.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Each CH in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. The double bond is between the two CH groups, so each has two substituents and a double bond. So, each CH has only two substituents, making them not chiral centers.

Thus, I think I was correct earlier. So, only compound 2 has a chiral center.

Wait, but then looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer and has a different arrangement that makes it chiral.

Wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, which is a trans configuration. This doesn't create a chiral center but leads to geometric isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry and thus achiral.

So, the only correct answer is compound 2, but looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct option is A) 1,2,4.

But I thought 1 doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again. The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'.

Each substituent is a nitro and a carboxylate. So, each benzene has two substituents, each at 2 and 6 positions. So, each ring is symmetrical.

But, the biphenyl group can have different conformations. But optical isomerism is about the arrangement in space, but for that, it needs a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that no plane of symmetry exists, then it could be chiral.

Wait, in a biphenyl, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a non-superimposable mirror image, then the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, each substituent is at position 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, the molecule would be achiral.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the substituents. Let me visualize the structure.

Each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). Now, the 1 and 1' positions are connected, so the substituents on each ring are in positions that are across from the connection point.

So, perhaps the overall structure is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), option C (2,3), and option D (1,2). So, perhaps I was wrong and compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, but each CH has only two substituents (COOCH3 and H). So, no chiral centers.

Wait a minute, what about if the substituents are in such a way that they create a plane of asymmetry, like in a molecule with a center of chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality, such as in allenes or certain bridged structures. But I don't think so in this case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think: if all options are wrong except maybe option A (1,2,4), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 actually has a chiral center. Let me think again about the structure of dimethyl fumarate.

Structure: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3.

Each CH group is connected to:

- a COOCH3 group

- a H

- a double bond to the other CH.

So, each CH has two substituents. No four different groups, so no chiral centers.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a different way to look at this. I'm going to think about each option's optical activity.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → has a chiral center, so yes.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate → no.

So, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have a choice with only 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. If only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about another compound. Let's think about compound 4 again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is an example of a trans ester, but it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think of compound 1 again. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, if each benzene has a nitro and a carboxylate in 2 and 6 positions, and the two benzene rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are arranged such that the overall molecule is not symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

But in this case, each substituent is at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other, making the rings symmetrical.

Thus, the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the only correct option is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the carbonyl groups create a chiral center. But no, the carbonyl carbons are double-bonded and can't be chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon in fumarate's ester is connected to other substituents that I missed. No, the structure is such that the central carbons are in a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the two ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center on the oxygen. No, that's not possible.

Hmm.

In summary:

- Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

- Compound 2: Yes.

- Compound 3: No.

- Compound 4: No.

So, only compound 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. The closest is option C (2 and3), but 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in my analysis of compound 2. Let me double-check.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (second carbon) has groups:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)

- OH

- COOCH3

- H.

Yes, four different groups, so chiral center. Thus, it shows optical isomerism.

So, the only correct compound is 2. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake, and one of the other compounds also shows optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. What if the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each CH has four different substituents?

Wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, no, the double bond is C=C, so each C in the double bond is connected to two other C atoms (the adjacent CH groups). So, for each CH in the double bond, the substituents are:

- COOCH3

- H

- and two CH groups (from the double bond).

So, each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups. So, that's three substituents, not four. Hence, no chiral center.

Wait, but I think each CH is connected to only two groups besides the double bond. So, each CH has two substituents and two double bonds. So, perhaps each CH has three substituents in total.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me break it down.

In the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3:

- The first CH (attached to the left COOCH3) has:

   - COOCH3

   - H

   - and a double bond to the adjacent CH.

- The adjacent CH (attached to the right COOCH3) has:

   - COOCH3

   - H

   - and a double bond to the first CH.

So, each CH has two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and a double bond to each other. So, each CH has two substituents and two bonds in the double bond. So, each CH has two substituents, making them not chiral centers.

So, no, compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

At this point, I'm convinced that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of another compound.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is actually a diastereomer and does have a chiral center. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that only compound 2 has a chiral center, so the correct option would be the one that includes 2 and excludes the others.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2. But compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1,2,4.

But I don't think so because I don't see how 1 or 4 would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each CH has four different substituents. Let me imagine it again.

Each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3

- H

- and two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should move on.

Based on my analysis, the only correct answer is option 2, but since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again about its structure. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Each benzene has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 2 and 6. The molecule is connected at 1 and 1'.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each benzene are in positions that don't allow a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a choice based on my analysis. So, the only correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1,2,4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: which of the four compounds have a stereogenic center?

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So, only 2 is correct. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A:1,2,4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center because of the two ester groups on each end. No, because the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond and each CH only has two substituents.

I think I'll have to settle with the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but it's not an option. So, perhaps the correct option is option A:1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck compound 4.

Another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the two ester groups are in a trans configuration, which doesn't create a chiral center but creates geometric isomerism.

Yes, that's correct. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, but let me think about the substituents. Each substituent is at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A:1,2,4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. What if the structure is not symmetrical? Let me imagine the structure again.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. The two CH groups are each attached to COOCH3 and H. So, each CH has two substituents, making them not chiral centers.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again. Suppose the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks symmetry, making it chiral.

For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But in this case, each substituent is at 2 and 6, which are para positions, making each ring symmetrical.

Thus, the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1,2,4. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center due to the oxygen's arrangement. No, because oxygen is double-bonded.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1,2,4.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the only correct answer based on my analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or a non-superimposable mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   The structure consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with substituents at the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions. Each benzene ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate methyl ester group. The molecule is symmetrical due to the para arrangement of the substituents on each benzene ring, and the overall structure has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups. Since the carbonyl carbon does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH₃), with a double bond between the two central carbons. Each CH group is bonded to a COOCH₃ group and a hydrogen, but these groups are not unique on each carbon. The molecule is symmetrical and does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (compound 2) exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest match to the correct answer is **option A (1, 2, 4)**, though compound 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
