Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents for each step. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B, with H2O, to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B. So I need to figure out what reagents are needed for each transformation.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When ketones react with NaCN, I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition. I remember that ketones can undergo addition reactions with cyanide. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Oh right, the reaction between a ketone and NaCN typically involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, I think it forms (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The nitrile group is at the end. So, the molecule would be CH2CN-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butanenitrile would be four carbons with CN at the end. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is given as butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, it's a nucleophilic addition. The product is (CH3)2COH-CN? No, wait, perhaps (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple addition. Let me think about the possible mechanism. Another possibility is the formation of an imine or something else, but NaCN is a source of CN- which is a good nucleophile. Oh wait, but maybe the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin requires an acid catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+ or something that provides H+.

Wait, but NaCN is a strong base, right? So maybe the reaction is done in a basic solution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes when adding CN- to a ketone, you need an acid catalyst. For example, H3O+ as a proton source to help the carbonyl become more electrophilic.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably H3O+. Because without acid, the addition of CN- might not proceed efficiently. So that's reaction A done with H3O+.

Now, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does that happen? Usually, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to acids involves strong acid and water, or perhaps using a catalyst like H2SO4 or another acid.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So adding H2O (as reagent B) and a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, but the options for B are H2O and another reagent. Wait, looking at the problem statement, the second reaction's reagent B is given along with H2O. Wait, no, the problem says: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> product." So, it's B that's the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction, perhaps as a solvent or reactant.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The reaction would typically involve strong acid and heat. Or, maybe using a Lewis acid catalyst.

Alternatively, another method is hydrolysis with H3O+ (acidic conditions) and heat. Or, perhaps using HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, but wait. Another approach for nitrile to acid conversion is the hydrolysis under basic conditions followed by acid work-up. But in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon, which might complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH, depending on the option.

Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or something else.

Wait, but the first step's reagent A is probably H3O+ (option A or B), and in the second step, the reagent B could be HCl or another acid.

Wait, no, the options are for A and B. So in option A, A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl. Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH.

So, first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

We thought A is H3O+.

Second reaction: the nitrile to acid. So the reagent B must be an acidic aqueous condition. For nitrile hydrolysis, strong acids are often used, like concentrated HCl with heat, or perhaps H2SO4 as a catalyst.

Wait, but another method is the hydrolysis of nitriles using a strong acid, say HCl, in a protic solvent, under reflux. Alternatively, using H3O+ would also work.

So if B is HCl, that would make sense. Let me think: the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C also has B as HCl. So possible.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the correct option would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would match.

But wait, another possibility: Could the first reaction be using NaHSO3 as the reagent? Let me think about what NaHSO3 does. Sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, in the formation of bisulfite adducts, but that's more for aldehydes and ketones. Alternatively, NaHSO3 can be used in the presence of NaCN for the formation of cyanohydrins under certain conditions, perhaps.

Wait, but I thought that the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. So H3O+ is the acid. So NaHSO3 might not be the right reagent. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the presence of HCN, perhaps, but in this case, NaCN is providing CN^-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the first reaction again.

Butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN (source of CN^-) and reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin. The reaction of ketones with CN^- in acidic conditions gives the cyanohydrin. So the reaction is:

RCO-R' + CN^- → RCH(OH)CN + R'

Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN^- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction, or perhaps the product's structure is different.

Wait, perhaps butan-2-one has four carbons. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon structure. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which I'm now a bit unsure about. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is:

CH2-C(O)-CH3

Wait, actually, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2-C=O, which is 2-butanone, correct. So when it reacts with NaCN and H3O+, it would form (CH3)2-C(OH)-CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, that doesn't match. Oh wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the product. Let's see. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the product would have a new carbon attached. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is a three-carbon chain with the nitrile. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So perhaps I'm mistaken in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product is longer. Maybe the reaction is not a simple addition but something else. Alternative reaction: Maybe the ketone is undergoing a substitution or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, but the product is correct as given. So perhaps I should move on and not get stuck here.

Assuming that the first reaction requires H3O+ as a catalyst, then in the options, A would be either H3O+ or something else. For the second reaction, the nitrile to acid requires HCl as a catalyst, so option A and C have B as HCl.

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

But wait, what is the role of reagent A? For the first reaction, the formation of the cyanohydrin requires acid. So the reagent A should be H3O+.

But let me think about NaHSO3. Sodium bisulfite is often used as a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. In some reactions, it can act as a reducing agent, but in this case, perhaps it's providing the H+ needed for the reaction. So if NaHSO3 is used, it would provide H+ as well as SO3^2-.

But I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is needed here. I think the correct reagent for the first step is H3O+ because that's the typical acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.

So that would point to option A or B for the first part.

Wait, but the second reaction would then require HCl as the reagent B. So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl.

So if I pick option A, that would mean for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second, B is HCl.

Wait, but let me check the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed.

In acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for this are HCl in water, perhaps under reflux. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst.

So reagent B is likely HCl.

That would suggest that the correct option is A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

But wait, let's look at option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl.

Could NaHSO3 be used in the first step? Well, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+, but perhaps it can still act as an acid catalyst. But I'm not sure if it's the standard reagent for this reaction. I think the standard is H3O+ or HCl.

So, given that, the correct reagents would be A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B= HCl

So, if the first reaction requires H3O+, which is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents for each step.

### Reaction 1:  
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile. The reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, where CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

### Reaction 2:  
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
In this step, the nitrile group (-CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically occurs under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is the most appropriate reagent, as it provides the strong acidic environment required for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of Options:  
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is appropriate for the second reaction.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group in the second reaction.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation, as it is not as effective as H₃O⁺ for providing the necessary acidic conditions in the first reaction.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:  
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.
