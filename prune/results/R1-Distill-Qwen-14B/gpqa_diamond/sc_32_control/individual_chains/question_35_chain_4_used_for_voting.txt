Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are important in quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with spin. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write down what Ay looks like.

Wait, c is h/(4π), right? So multiplying S by that. So let me compute that. The matrix S is:

0   -i
i   0

So when I multiply by c, each element becomes c times the respective element. So, Ay should be:

[ [ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, let me double-check. Matrix multiplication would be each element multiplied by c. That seems right.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Right, eigenvalues are the a's in the equation Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, let's write down (Ay - a I):

[ (0 - a)      (-i h/(4π))   ]
[ (i h/(4π))    (0 - a)      ]

The determinant is ( -a ) * ( -a ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating the determinant: (a²) - [ (i * -i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, i * (-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) )= 1.

So the determinant is a² - [ (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

So the equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Wait, no, wait. The determinant is (a)^2 - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, the off-diagonal elements are ( -i c ) and (i c ), so when multiplied together, it's (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) c². i * i is i² = -1. So -i * i = 1. So (-i)(i) = 1.

So the product is (1) * c².

Wait, c is h/(4π), so c² is h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant is (a^2) - ( (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, wait. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

But wait, looking at the options, none of the options directly state that. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our eigenvalues are real, right? Because the determinant equation gave us a real equation, leading to real eigenvalues (since the matrix is Hermitian? Or is it?)

Wait, wait. Let me think about the matrix Ay. Ay is c * S, and S is as given. S's elements are purely imaginary and real? Let me see:

S is:

0   -i
i    0

So S is a Hermitian matrix? Because S† (the conjugate transpose) would be:

0    i
- i   0

Which is the same as S? Because the original S has second row i, 0. Transposing and taking complex conjugate would give the same as S. Yes, because the (1,2) element is -i, and its conjugate is i, which is the (2,1) element. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay should be Hermitian because c is real, so c * S is Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, which implies its eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but the options don't have all real eigenvalues. Let me check each option.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But I calculated real eigenvalues only. So this can't be right.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But I thought eigenvalues are real. So this option's eigenvalues are complex, which doesn't fit since Ay is Hermitian, implying real eigenvalues.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, I'm not sure. Well, A² would be the square of the angular momentum operator. Since A² is a scalar multiple (like (ħ/2)^2 * identity matrix for spin-1/2 particles), the eigenfunctions of A² would be the same as any state, because it's just a multiple of the identity. So any eigenvector of Ay would automatically be an eigenvector of A². So option C is saying that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. But wait, I thought that for angular momentum components, [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, so they don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So for option C, it's correct that they can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. So C could be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, not sure about this. The basis functions of the operator would be the eigenvectors. So if the eigenvectors form a basis, then yes. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's go back to the eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are real, then options A and B can't be correct, because they are either complex or have both real and imaginary parts. So that leaves options C and D.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct eigenvalues are real and equal to ±h/(4π). So let's see.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me double-check the determinant.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0      (-i c) ]
[ i c     0 ]

So the characteristic equation is:

(0 - a)(0 - a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = 0

Which is a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = 0

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) c² = (-i^2) c² = (-(-1)) c² = c².

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c.

Since c is h/(4π), so a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, and they are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of the options seem to directly state this. But let's check again.

Wait, option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, but if the eigenvalues are real, their imaginary parts are zero. So option B is incorrect.

Option A: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which isn't possible because the eigenvalues are entirely real. So A is wrong.

So it must be either C or D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of the operator would be the eigenvectors, but the basis functions of the operator are usually the eigenvectors. So if the operator is 2x2, then the eigenvectors form a basis, but in this case, because the eigenvalues are distinct (two different values), the eigenvectors are linearly independent, so they form a basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So D says that, so D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's review each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I for spin-1/2 particles, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. The second part: eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So the statement in C is correct.

So both C and D seem correct? But I thought the eigenvalues are real, so D says the eigenfunctions are the basis, which they are. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So which statements hold true?

Wait, let me think again about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar multiple (i.e., same for all states), any eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct. The second part: they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So since Ay is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so yes, they are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D could be correct. But I don't think that's possible. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, another way to approach: when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct. So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the options are in a multiple-choice format, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says which statement is correct. So perhaps I should think about each option's validity.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts. No, they are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues are complex, so B is wrong.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Yes, because A² is a scalar operator. But can they be eigenfunctions of Az? No. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues form an orthogonal basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D seem correct. But looking at the options, which one is correct?

Hmm. Let me think about the question again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but what about option C? It says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, yes, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², so the first part is correct. The second part says they can't be eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ (something), so they don't share eigenvectors. So option C is correct.

Hmm, so both C and D seem correct, but the options are presented as possible, and the question is which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine each option's exact wording.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the space it acts on, which is two-dimensional. So the statement in D is correct.

So, I think both C and D are correct statements. But since only one option is correct, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but can the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of A²? Since A² is a scalar, any vector is an eigenfunction. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So option C is correct.

But the question allows only one correct option, so perhaps either C or D is correct.

Wait, perhaps both statements are correct, but the options are presented such that only one is correct. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me re-calculate the eigenvalues.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

The eigenvalues equation is:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0 → | -a      -i c | = 0
                       | i c     -a    |

So determinant is a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( i*(-i) c² )

Wait, i * (-i) is (-i²) → -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a = ±c.

So eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, so all the options with imaginary parts are wrong.

So, looking again, the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real.

So, looking at the options, the correct statements would be those that don't have complex eigenvalues.

So options A and B are out.

Between C and D, both relate to the properties of the eigenfunctions.

C says the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, yes.

D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is option C, because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. Because the problem says during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps during the calculation, it's correct that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: perhaps I should compute the eigenvectors to see their form.

Let me compute the eigenvectors for a = +h/(4π).

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a    -i c ]
[ i c    -a ]

So substituting a = h/(4π) = c.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -c    -i c ]
[ i c    -c ]

To find the eigenvectors, solve (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

So first equation: -c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to ( -i, 1 ), because φ1 = -i φ2. Let me pick φ2 = 1, so φ1 = -i.

Similarly, for a = -c, the matrix becomes:

[ c     -i c ]
[ i c    c ]

First equation: c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (i, 1).

So the eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and ( i, 1 ), up to a scalar.

So, to check option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is the operator ( (ħ/2)^2 I ), because for spin-1/2 particles, S² has eigenvalue (ħ/2)^2 * (something) times the identity. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total angular momentum operator for spin is S, but here the operator is Ay, which is the Y-component of the spin.

Wait, in any case, A² would be the square of the operator, which for a spin-1/2 system, would be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A².

Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², which makes the first part of option C correct. The second part says that they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because Ay and Az don't share eigenvectors as they don't commute.

So option C seems correct.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y \), which is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The matrix \( A_y \) is given by:

\[
A_y = c \cdot S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i c \\ 
i c & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Substituting \( A_y - aI \):

\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 
-a & -i c \\ 
i c & -a 
\end{pmatrix} = a^2 - (i c)(-i c) = a^2 - c^2 = 0.
\]

This simplifies to \( a^2 = c^2 \), so the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
-\frac{h}{4\pi} & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
\phi_1 \\ 
\phi_2 
\end{pmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first equation, \( -\frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_1 - i \frac{h}{4\pi} \phi_2 = 0 \), which gives \( \phi_1 = -i \phi_2 \). Choosing \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} 
- i \\ 
1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), a similar calculation gives the eigenvector:

\[
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} 
i \\ 
1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

- **Option B**: Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, making any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). Additionally, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are distinct.

- **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the operator. This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a complete basis for the 2-dimensional space.

### Step 4: Final Decision
Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation," the focus is on the properties of the eigenfunctions. Option C is more relevant to the context of the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
