Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine the conductor is a big sphere, and inside it, towards one side, there's a smaller cavity that's off-center by s units.

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is its distance from the center of the cavity. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves based on the situation. But in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens?

I think the cavity is conducting because it's a spherical cavity. Oh wait, no, wait. The conductor itself is a conductor, but the cavity is just a hollow inside it. So the inner surface of the conductor must respond to the charge inside the cavity. Since the conductor was neutral, the charges inside the conductor itself would rearrange.

So, the charge +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface, which is near the cavity, will have an induced charge. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the inner surface must have an induced charge -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Wait, no. Oh wait, no, actually, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal to the negative of the charge inside the cavity. So inner surface has -q. Then the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor was neutral, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q because the +q in the cavity attracts it. So the outer surface must have +q because the inner is -q, conductor is neutral, so the outer is +q.

Wait, but the conductor is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q. That makes sense because the conductor's total charge is zero.

So the electric field outside the conductor (since we're considering P outside) should be due to the charge on the outer surface, right? Because the inner charges are enclosed within the conductor, and the field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's outer surface has a charge, but the inner surface has another. So when you’re outside the conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge is at the center, because of the spherical symmetry. So the outer charge is +q, making the field at P as if it's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but hold on. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if the charge is +q at the center.

But wait, the conductor's own charges (the outer surface) produce the field outside. So the field outside the conductor is due to the +q on the outer surface, and the outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So the field at any point outside should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but in the options, that's option B. However, let me make sure. Because the point P is outside the conductor, but the charge distribution on the conductor is such that the field outside is like a point charge at the center.

But wait, the charge inside the cavity influenced the inner surface but not the outer. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor. But the conductor is neutral, right? Wait, no. The conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface has -q, the outer has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, no, no—wait, the conductor was neutral. So the outer surface must have +q because the inner has -q. So the total charge is -q (inner) + +q (outer) = 0, which matches the initial neutral state.

So the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface charge, which is +q. So the field at point P would be the same as if all that charge were at the center.

But wait, point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field E at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²). That's option B.

But let me think again. Because the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor, does that affect the field outside?

Wait, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the charge inside. The outer surface will have the same charge as the conductor's total charge. But in this case, the conductor was neutral, so the outer surface must have +q, as the inner is -q.

But the arrangement of the charges on the outer surface: since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface charge will distribute uniformly, regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Because the conductor is a sphere, the field outside depends only on the total charge, not on where the inner charge is located.

So the electric field outside the conductor is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the field at point P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems correct. Because the conductor's outer surface is +q, and the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Alternatively, I might have gotten mixed up with the positions, but the key point is that the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside depends only on that charge and the distance from the center.

So yes, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) inside it. The cavity is centered at a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, located at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

Key points to consider:

1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge on it is zero.  
   - The inner surface of the conductor, which is in direct contact with the cavity, will have an induced charge of \( -q \) due to the positive charge \( +q \) inside the cavity.  
   - To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of \( +q \).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface.  
   - Since the conductor is spherical, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly.  
   - The electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge \( +q \) located at the center of the conductor.  

3. **Field at Point \( P \)**:  
   - Point \( P \) is outside the conductor, at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor.  
   - The electric field at \( P \) is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression incorrectly depends on \( (l - s \cos\theta)^2 \), which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: This matches the correct formula for the electric field outside the conductor, as derived above.  
   - **Option C**: This expression incorrectly depends on \( (l + s \cos\theta)^2 \), which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends only on \( l \), which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on \( L \), not \( l \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
