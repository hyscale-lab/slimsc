Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, and since it's a ratio, the constants will cancel out, so I don't need to worry about their exact values.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, does mass matter here? Hmm, the question is about luminosity, which depends on radius and temperature. Unless the mass is a hint for the temperature. Oh, wait, maybe the stars' masses are related to their temperatures via something like the mass-luminosity relation. Oh right! The mass-luminosity relation says that L ∝ M^α, where α is around 3 to 4.5. But wait, that applies to stars on the main sequence. But the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe I don't need to think about mass directly. Or perhaps the masses are there to confuse.

Wait, the problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. Because as T increases, λ_max decreases.

So T1 equals T2. Oh, so temperature is the same for both stars. Then, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radius squared.

Wait, calculating the luminosity ratio L1/L2. Since L = 4πR²σT⁴, and since R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, then:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

But T1 and T2 are the same, so (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So A is exactly 2.25. But wait, am I missing something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect this?

Oh, wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But in terms of star brightness and luminosity, does that affect the calculation here? Because luminosity is intrinsic brightness, not the apparent brightness. Apparent brightness would depend on distance and velocity through Doppler effect, but the problem says they computed the luminosity, which is intrinsic.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. So maybe this is about the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. So when they say the wavelengths are the same, perhaps it's the observed wavelength, which depends on the star's actual emission wavelength and its velocity.

Oh! So if the stars' rest wavelengths are the same, but due to radial velocity, their observed wavelengths could differ. But wait, in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift brings them to the same observed wavelength.

Wait, let me think. The peak wavelength emitted by each star is λ0 for each. But because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength λ_observed is λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that. Wait, the Doppler shift formula for light is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but only when v is much less than c. Alternatively, for small velocities, the approximation is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the formula.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max1 equals observed λ_max2.

But each star's emitted λ_max is determined by their temperature. Since the emitted λ_max is b / T, and if T is same, then emitted λ_max is same. So without any Doppler shift, the observed λ_max would be same. But if one star is moving, its observed λ_max would shift.

Wait, but in the given, the observed λ_max is same for both. So if Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s, but Star_1 is at rest (0 km/s), then their emitted λ_max would have to be different so that after Doppler shift, they match.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if Star_1 is at rest, its observed λ_max is λ1 = (b / T1). For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is λ2_observed. But the problem states that λ1_observed = λ2_observed.

So let's denote the rest frame λ_max of Star_1 as λ1_rest = b / T1. Similarly, λ2_rest = b / T2.

But since the observed λ_max are the same, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Assuming that Star_2 is moving towards us (if radial velocity is positive when moving away, or negative when moving towards. The problem states Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

Wait, but in that case, the observed wavelength of Star_2 would be longer (redshifted) if moving away. Because when a star moves away, the wavelengths are stretched (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So for Star_2 moving away, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c), since v is positive. But Star_1 has λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = λ1_obs (since Star_1 is not moving). And λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c), assuming v is positive when moving away.

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

We can cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, but this would imply that T2 is higher than T1, because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1. Or am I mixing up the signs? Let me think about the Doppler shift again.

Wait, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But that's when the star is moving away. Wait, no. Wait, when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength increases (redshift), so λ_obs > λ_rest. The formula I remember is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) for small v/c.

Wait, but perhaps the exact formula is needed here. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for small v, the sqrt can be approximated as 1, so λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c). But if the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative, so λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c).

In our case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume that the velocity is positive when moving away from us. So Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer. So for Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Since v2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v2/c is approximately 0.002333... So small enough that the approximation should be valid.

So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8 ) = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ λ2_rest * 1.002333.

On the other hand, Star_1 is at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 1.002333

But λ1_rest = b / T1 = λ1_obs = λ2_rest * 1.002333

Thus, λ1_rest = (b / T2) * 1.002333

But λ1_rest is b / T1, so substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.002333

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * 1.002333

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333

So T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 and T2 were the same because the emitted wavelengths were same. But now, this shows that they're not the same. Because the observed wavelengths are the same, but the Doppler shift makes their rest temperatures different.

Hmm, this complicates things because now the temperatures aren't the same, which affects the luminosity calculation.

So since T2 is slightly higher than T1, and R1 is 1.5 R2, I can compute L1 and L2.

Wait, I need to compute L1 / L2. Let's write the luminosity formula.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1² / R2² = 2.25.

And T2 = T1 * 1.002333. So T2 = 1.002333 T1.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997678.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997678)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me compute 0.997678^4.

First, compute ln(0.997678) ≈ -0.002334. Multiply by 4: -0.009336. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.009336) ≈ 0.9907.

Alternatively, since it's a small value, perhaps use the approximation (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx.

Wait, 0.997678 = 1 - 0.002322.

So (1 - 0.002322)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002322) = 1 - 0.009288 = 0.990712.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So then L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.23.

Wait, that's option D: ~2.23.

But earlier I thought that T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25 (option A). But considering the Doppler shift, the temperatures are not the same, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their emitted wavelengths are determined by their temperatures via Wien's law. But when they observe the stars, the wavelengths they see are affected by Doppler shift. So the observed λ_max for each star is the same, but the rest λ_max (emitted) are different.

So in that case, because the observed λ_max is the same, their rest λ_max (emitted) must be different, because of their velocities.

So the emitted λ_max for Star_1 is lambda1 = b / T1.

The emitted lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda2 = b / T2.

But observed lambda1 is lambda1, since Star_1 is at rest.

Observed lambda2 is lambda2 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ lambda2 * 1.002333.

But since observed lambdas are same, lambda1 = lambda2 * 1.002333.

So lambda1 = (b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.002333.

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is a bit higher than T1.

Thus, when calculating L1 and L2:

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1/R2 is 1.5, so R1^2/R2^2 is 2.25.

T1/T2 is 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.997678.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997678)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

Multiply by 2.25: 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but what about the fact that Star_2 is moving away? Because Star_2's observed brightness would be dimmer due to redshift. But luminosity is an intrinsic property, so the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity. So when the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity, perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift, so that their actual luminosity is calculated correctly. Or perhaps they didn't, and the observed flux is different, but the question is about the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is computed to be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So it's about the intrinsic luminosity. So in that case, the calculation I did earlier (with T2 = 1.002333 T1) leads to L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, so option D.

But what's the exact calculation? Let me do it more precisely.

Compute v=700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.0023333...

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333...

So T2 = T1 * 1.0023333...

Compute (T1 / T2)^4 = (1 / 1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute 1.0023333 = 1 + 0.0023333.

So ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.002329.

Multiply by 4: 0.009316.

So (T1/T2)^4 = e^(-0.009316) ≈ 1 -0.009316 + (0.009316^2)/2 - ... Approximately 0.99077.

So 2.25 * 0.99077 = approximately 2.228.

Which is ~2.23, so option D.

So the correct answer should be D, ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Temperature**: The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the observed wavelengths being equal implies that the rest wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) are related by the Doppler shift due to the radial velocity of Star_2.
3. **Radial Velocity**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s (at rest), while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s (moving away). The Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), this can be approximated as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:

\[
\lambda_{1, \text{rest}} = \lambda_{2, \text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Given \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
v/c = \frac{7 \times 10^5}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997678
\]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), we find:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

For the temperature term, using \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997678 \):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.997678)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^n \approx 1 - nx \) for small \( x \):

\[
(0.997678)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002322 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to option **D**.
