Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, so Li with 3 neutrons—wait, Li normally has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators relates to the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to consider the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or maybe I should think in terms of Lorentz factors.

The formula I'm vaguely recalling is the total energy E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. And gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, so I can calculate gamma using the given speed.

Given that v is 0.96c, let me compute gamma. So v = 0.96c. Let's plug that in.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) )

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So that's right, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, 1/0.28 is actually 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Lithium-6 has a mass of about... I think the atomic mass is around 6.941 g/mol, but wait, I need to get the actual mass in kilograms per nucleus.

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So for Li-6, the mass is 6 u. So 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that. 6 * 1.6605e-27 is 9.963e-27 kg.

But wait, no, wait a second. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually the mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But wait, maybe I should use the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the rest mass energy in MeV and then compute gamma times that.

Wait, the rest mass energy E0 is m0 c². The mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units. Each u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 * 931.5 MeV = ?

Calculating that: 6*931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So E0 = 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma * E0. So 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, let's approximate. 3.5 *5.589 is 19.5615. 0.0714 * 5.589 is about 0.400. So total around 19.96 GeV. Wait, that's about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and D is 21.419. Hmm, but my approximation might be off. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857
3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857
3.5714 * 0.089 = ?

Wait, 0.089 is 0.08 + 0.009.

So 3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.285712
3.5714 * 0.009 = 0.0321426
So sum is 0.3178546.

So total of all parts:

17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427; plus 0.3178546 is 19.96055 GeV.

So approximately 19.96 GeV. Hmm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, and option D is higher. Wait, maybe my approximation of gamma is off.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. v is 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely.

Wait, 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake with the mass of Li-6. Let me double-check.

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Let's see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 atomic mass units. Wait, but wait, that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Oh wait, no, wait. In particle physics, when we talk about the nucleus, we're considering the mass of the nucleons.

Wait, but the nucleus includes protons and neutrons. Let me compute the exact mass.

Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So protons have a mass of approximately 1.007276 u each, and neutrons about 1.008665 u each. So 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = ?

Calculating:

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995
Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

So m = 6.047823 u.

Now, converting u to kg: 6.047823 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 6.047823 * 1.6605390666e-27 = ?

Hmm, 6 * 1.66 is about 9.96e-27. But the exact value:

Let me compute 6.047823 * 1.6605390666e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the mass in kilograms, but maybe it's easier to compute the rest energy in GeV.

Wait, because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.047823 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV (5.589 GeV)

0.047823 * 931.5 ≈ ?

0.04 * 931.5 = 37.26

0.007823 * 931.5 ≈ approx 7.30 MeV

So total is 37.26 +7.30=44.56 MeV.

So total rest energy is 5.589 + 0.04456 GeV ≈ 5.6336 GeV.

So E0 = 5.6336 GeV.

Wait, that's more precise. So E0 = 5.6336 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857. So E = gamma * E0 = 3.57142857 *5.6336 ≈ ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.6336 

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285
3.57142857 * 0.6336 = ?

Wait, 3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.14285714
3.57142857 * 0.0336 = ?

0.0336 is 336e-5, so 3.57142857 * 0.0336.

Compute 3.57142857 * 0.03 = 0.107142857
3.57142857 * 0.0036 = 0.0128571426
So total 0.107142857 + 0.0128571426 = 0.12000.

So 0.6336 part is 2.14285714 + 0.12 = 2.26285714.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.26285714 = 20.12 GeV.

Hmm, so 20.12 GeV. Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation of gamma and E0.

Let me compute gamma again. v =0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1- (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) 

0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Now, E0 is 6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.047823 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.047823 *931.5 = ?

0.04 *931.5 = 37.26

0.007823 *931.5 = approximately 7.314 MeV.

So 37.26 +7.314 =44.574.

Total E0=5589 +44.574 = 5633.574 MeV =5.633574 GeV.

So E0=5.633574 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * E0 =3.5714285714 *5.633574.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.633574.

Let me compute this as:

3.5714285714 * 5 =17.857142857
3.5714285714 *0.633574 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 = 2.1428571428
3.5714285714 *0.033574 = ?

0.033574 can be broken into 0.03 +0.003574.

3.5714285714 *0.03 = 0.1071428571
3.5714285714 *0.003574 = ?

0.003574 *3.5714285714.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.003 = 0.0107142857
3.5714285714 * 0.000574 = 0.0020535714

So 0.0107142857 +0.0020535714=0.0127678571.

So the 0.033574 part is 0.1071428571 +0.0127678571=0.1199107142.

So the 0.633574 part is 2.1428571428 +0.1199107142=2.262767857.

Total E=17.857142857 +2.262767857=20.11991071 GeV.

So approximately 20.1199 GeV, which is about 20.1199 GeV.

The options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.633574 more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise values for the masses.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is 1.008664 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m = 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) = 3*(1.007276 +1.008664) = 3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

So m =6.04782 u.

So E0=6.04782 *931.5 MeV = ?

Wait, 6.04782 *931.5.

Let me compute this more precisely.

6 *931.5 =5589
0.04782 *931.5 = ?

0.04 *931.5=37.26

0.00782 *931.5= ?

Compute 0.007 *931.5=6.5205

0.00082 *931.5=0.76353

So 6.5205 +0.76353 =7.28403.

So 0.04782 *931.5=37.26 +7.28403=44.54403 MeV.

So E0=5589 +44.54403=5633.54403 MeV=5.63354403 GeV.

Now, E= gamma * E0 =3.5714285714 *5.63354403.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

3.5714285714 multiplied by 5.63354403.

Let me try 3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.63354403 = ?

Hmm, 0.63354403 is approximately 0.633544.

So 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.14285714284

3.5714285714 *0.033544 = ?

3.5714285714 *.03 =0.107142857142

3.5714285714 *0.003544 = ?

0.003544 = 3544e-7.

3.5714285714 *0.003544 =3.5714285714 *0.003 =0.010714285714

Plus 3.5714285714 *0.000544 = approximately 0.00194285714.

So total 0.010714285714 +0.00194285714=0.01265714285.

So the 0.033544 part is 0.107142857142 + 0.01265714285 = 0.119800000... 

Wait, 0.107142857142 +0.01265714285=0.1198.

So the 0.633544 part is 2.14285714284 +0.1198=2.26265714284.

So E=17.857142857 +2.26265714284=20.1198 GeV.

So about 20.1198 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But perhaps my approximation is not precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more exact decimal places.

Wait, perhaps using exact gamma and E0.

Alternatively, maybe using a calculator approach is better. Let me compute 3.5714285714285714 *5.63354403.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, another approach: the exact calculation of gamma when v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

=1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216)

=1/sqrt(0.0784)

=1/0.28.

Yes, exactly 3.5714285714.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Now, E0 is 5.63354403 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.63354403.

Let me compute this using a calculator:

3.5714285714 *5.63354403.

Hmm, let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.63354403.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each step more accurately.

3.5714285714 times 5.63354403.

Let me write it as:

3.5714285714 × 5.63354403.

Perhaps compute it as:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.63354403 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.03354403 = ?

0.03354403 *3.5714285714.

Hmm, 0.03 *3.5714285714=0.1071428571.

0.00354403 *3.5714285714.

0.003 *3.5714285714=0.0107142857.

0.00054403 *3.5714285714 ≈0.001943 (since 3.5714 *0.0005=0.0017857, but let me compute more accurately: 3.5714285714 *0.00054403 = 0.001943 approximately.

So sum is 0.0107142857 +0.001943=0.0126572857.

So 0.03354403 *3.5714285714 ≈0.1071428571 +0.0126572857=0.1198001428.

So 0.63354403 ×3.5714285714 ≈2.14285714284 +0.1198001428=2.26265728564.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.26265728564=20.11980014264 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV.

Looking back at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the options have rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, the question says the precision is at 1e-4, which is four decimal places. So perhaps the correct answer is 20.12 GeV, but the options have option C as 20.132, and option D as 21.419.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.63354403.

Another approach: use exact decimal multiplication.

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator here. But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the numbers as fractions.

Gamma is 3.5714285714, which is 25/7, because 25 ÷7 is approximately 3.5714285714.

Wait, 25/7 = 3.5714285714. So yes.

So E0 =5.63354403 GeV.

So E = (25/7) *5.63354403.

Compute 25 *5.63354403 =140.83860075.

Divide by 7: 140.83860075 ÷7.

7 ×20 =140, so 140 ÷7=20.

Left with 0.83860075 ÷7 = approximately 0.1198.

So 20 + 0.1198 =20.1198 GeV.

So precisely, E=20.1198 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132, which is about 0.012 GeV higher. That's a difference of about 12 MeV, which seems significant. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps more precise values are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6.04782 u, but maybe a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of lithium-6. But I don't have that information at hand. Alternatively, perhaps I should note that in real-world calculations, the binding energy is considered, but in this problem, I think it's treated as a free nucleus, so using the sum of protons and neutrons is acceptable.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the speed is 0.96c, but perhaps the actual gamma is a bit different when considering more precise calculations. Wait, but I thought 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass energy.

Let me recheck the rest mass calculation.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u each.

Neutron mass: 1.008664 u each.

So 3*(1.007276)=3.021828 u.

3*(1.008664)=3.025992 u.

Total: 3.021828 +3.025992 =6.04782 u.

So E0 =6.04782 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.04782 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.04782*931.5=44.574 (as computed earlier).

So E0=5633.574 MeV=5.633574 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is coming from the approximation in gamma.

Wait, is gamma exactly 3.5714285714? Because sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so 1/0.28 is exactly 3.5714285714.

So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.633574.

Let me compute this using a more precise method.

3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.633574. Let me compute 0.633574 ×3.5714285714.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.033574 ×3.5714285714.

Compute 0.03 ×3.5714285714=0.1071428571.

0.003574 ×3.5714285714.

0.003 ×3.5714285714=0.0107142857.

0.000574 ×3.5714285714=0.0020535714.

So sum for 0.003574 is 0.0107142857 +0.0020535714=0.0127678571.

So 0.033574 ×3.5714285714=0.1071428571 +0.0127678571=0.1199107142.

So 0.633574 ×3.5714285714=2.1428571428 +0.1199107142=2.262767857.

Adding to the 17.857142857 gives 20.11991071 GeV.

So about 20.1199 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.012 GeV higher than our calculated 20.1199.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. So perhaps the discrepancy is due to the fact that the rest mass energy isn't exactly the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Because in reality, when you form the nucleus, there is a mass defect due to binding energy. But in this problem, perhaps we are to ignore that and take the mass as the sum of individual nucleons. So I think our approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation using a calculator method. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but our calculation is 20.1199 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. So the closest option is C, which is 20.132 GeV. But the difference is about 0.012 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is treated as 6.941 u (the atomic mass) and then subtract the electrons. Wait, but that's probably not the case. Because for a nucleus, the mass is the sum of the nucleons, not including electrons.

Ah, wait a minute! Maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think: the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6 nucleus. But the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. So for the nucleus, the mass is approximately 6.941 u minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, but that's only if the nucleus is ionized. Wait, but in an ion, the number of electrons equals the charge. Li has 3 electrons, so Li-6 would have 3 electrons. So the mass of the ion would be (mass of 6 nucleons) minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, but wait, when you have an ion, the electrons are removed. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, so the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 u. But the actual mass of the nucleus is 6.941 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, but each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass would be 6.941 u -0.00164574 u =6.93935426 u.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. Let's compute E0 using this value.

E0 =6.93935426 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.93935426 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.93935426 *931.5 = ?

Wait, 0.93935426 *931.5 = let's compute.

0.9 *931.5 =838.35

0.03935426 *931.5 ≈ 0.03935426 *931.5 ≈36.65 MeV.

So 838.35 +36.65=875 MeV.

So 6.93935426 *931.5 ≈5589 +875=6464 MeV=6.464 GeV.

Wait, that's way higher than our previous calculation, which was about 5.63 GeV.

Hmm, this can't be right because the nucleus's mass is actually lower than the sum of protons and neutrons due to binding energy. Wait, but wait, earlier calculation considered the sum of protons and neutrons, but if the actual nucleus is lighter, that would reduce E0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: the atomic mass includes the electrons. So when considering the nucleus, you have to subtract the electrons' mass.

Wait, but the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 u. The number of electrons in a neutral Li atom is 3. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.941 u - (3 * electron mass).

Electron mass is 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.941 - 0.00164574=6.93935426 u.

So E0=6.93935426 *931.5 MeV = ?

6.93935426 *931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.93935426 *931.5=?

0.93935426 ×931.5.

Let me compute 0.9 ×931.5=838.35.

0.03935426 ×931.5.

0.03 ×931.5=27.945.

0.00935426 ×931.5≈8.719.

So 27.945 +8.719=36.664.

So 0.93935426 ×931.5 ≈838.35 +36.664=875.014 MeV.

So total E0=5589 +875.014=6464.014 MeV=6.464014 GeV.

Wait, that's a lot higher than our previous calculation. But that can't be right because the nucleus should be lighter than the sum of individual nucleons.

Ah, I see my mistake. The atomic mass of Li-6 is actually less than the sum of the nucleons plus electrons.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The atomic mass includes the nucleus plus electrons. So the nucleus's mass is atomic mass minus electrons' mass.

Wait, but wait, the binding energy of the nucleus is negative, meaning the nucleus is lighter than the sum of its parts. So if I take the atomic mass and subtract the electrons, I might be getting a higher mass than the actual nucleus. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Perhaps the correct way is to use the atomic mass of Li-6, which includes the nucleus and electrons, and then subtract the mass of the electrons to get the nucleus's mass.

So, atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.941 u. Number of electrons is 3. So nucleus mass is 6.941 u - (3 × 0.00054858 u).

So 3 ×0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So 6.941 -0.00164574=6.93935426 u.

But that would give a mass of about 6.93935 u, which is higher than the sum of the protons and neutrons (6.04782 u). That can't be right because the nucleus should be lighter than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy.

Ah, I see the confusion. The binding energy is the energy holding the nucleus together, so the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. Therefore, the approach I initially took (summing the individual protons and neutrons) should give a higher mass than the actual nucleus. But when I take the atomic mass and subtract the electrons, I get a higher mass than the sum of the nucleons, which is impossible.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me clarify: the correct way to find the nucleus's mass is to use the atomic mass and subtract the electrons' mass. But then, that would give the correct nucleus mass, including binding energy.

Wait, but the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is indeed atomic mass minus electrons' mass.

So for Li-6, the atomic mass is 6.941 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.941 u - (3 × 0.00054858 u)=6.941 -0.00164574=6.93935426 u.

Thus, E0=6.93935426 u *931.5 MeV/u=6.93935426 ×931.5.

Compute that: 6.93935426 ×931.5.

Wait, 6 ×931.5=5589.

0.93935426 ×931.5= as before, approximately 875.014 MeV.

So total is 5589 +875.014=6464.014 MeV=6.464014 GeV.

Wait, that's way higher than our earlier calculation, which was about 5.633 GeV.

But that can't be right because the nucleus should be lighter than the sum of individual nucleons. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the atomic mass of the ion. For a nucleus, the atomic mass includes the electrons, but for a bare nucleus, perhaps we should use the mass of the atom minus the electrons' mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the mass of the atom (including electrons) and then subtract the electrons' mass to get the nucleus's mass.

But then, the nucleus's mass would be 6.941 u -0.00164574 u=6.93935426 u.

But that's a mass higher than the sum of the nucleons (6.04782 u), which is impossible.

This suggests that there's a mistake in my approach. Perhaps I should instead use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which can be found from experimental data.

Wait, looking up the exact mass of Li-6 isn't possible right now, but I remember that the binding energy per nucleon for light nuclei like lithium is relatively low. The binding energy for Li-6 is about 6 MeV. So the actual mass of the nucleus would be the sum of the individual nucleons' masses minus the binding energy divided by c².

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we're supposed to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual protons and neutrons. Because otherwise, the calculation would be more complicated.

So going back, with E0=5.633574 GeV, and gamma=3.5714285714, E=20.1198 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy of about 0.012 GeV?

Ah, perhaps I should carry more precise decimal places in the calculation.

Let me recompute E=3.5714285714 ×5.63357403.

3.5714285714 *5.63357403.

Using a calculator:

3.5714285714 ×5.63357403.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.63357403.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.03357403 ×3.5714285714.

0.03 ×3.5714285714=0.1071428571.

0.00357403 ×3.5714285714.

0.003 ×3.5714285714=0.0107142857.

0.00057403 ×3.5714285714=0.0020535714.

So 0.00357403×3.5714285714=0.0107142857 +0.0020535714=0.0127678571.

So 0.03357403 ×3.5714285714=0.1071428571 +0.0127678571=0.1199107142.

So 0.63357403 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284 +0.1199107142=2.262767857.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.262767857=20.119910714 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1199 GeV, or 20.12 GeV when rounded to four significant figures.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Oh wait! Wait a minute. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC". RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy, but sometimes, when people refer to the energy of the collider, they might refer to the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, but no, in particle physics, the energy in colliders is often given as the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). But perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. Hmm, that would change things.

Let me think: if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy E_total = K + m0 c².

But if the question says the energy of the RHIC is E, that's the kinetic energy. But I'm not sure. Let me read the question again.

The question says: What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?

So RHIC's energy is the energy imparted to the ions, which is the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be E_total = gamma m0 c² = K + m0 c².

So if E is the kinetic energy, then K=gamma m0 c² - m0 c² = (gamma-1)m0 c².

But the question might be asking for the kinetic energy. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by calculating the total energy instead of the kinetic energy.

So if the question is about kinetic energy, then let's recalculate.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m0 c².

Earlier, E_total = gamma * m0 c² =20.1198 GeV.

So E_kinetic =20.1198 -5.633574 =14.486 GeV.

But looking at the options, the options are all above 18 GeV, so that can't be right. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy.

Hmm, so I think I was correct in the initial approach, calculating the total energy.

So if the correct calculation is about 20.12 GeV, but the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, perhaps there's a minor discrepancy due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or the mass.

Wait, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c, but perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise decimal places.

Wait, v=0.96c, so beta=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta²)=1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no change there.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the average atomic mass, including electrons, and then subtracting the electrons to find the nucleus mass.

Wait, but earlier that approach gave a much higher E0, which doesn't fit the options. So perhaps I should stick to the initial calculation.

In that case, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but my calculation is 20.1199 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. The difference is about 0.012 GeV, which is about 12 MeV. That's a 0.06% difference, which might be due to rounding in the constants used.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of c=3e8 m/s and other constants with more precise values. But I think that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is taken as 6.941 u (atomic mass) minus 3 *0.00054858 u =6.939354 u, leading to E0=6.939354 *931.5 MeV=6.939354 *931.5=?

Compute 6.939354 ×931.5:

6 ×931.5=5589.

0.939354 ×931.5=?

0.9 ×931.5=838.35.

0.039354 ×931.5 ≈36.67 MeV.

So 838.35 +36.67=875.02 MeV.

Total E0=5589 +875.02=6464.02 MeV=6.46402 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * E0=3.5714285714 *6.46402.

3.5714285714 *6=21.428571428.

3.5714285714 *0.46402=?

0.4 ×3.5714285714=1.42857142856.

0.06402 ×3.5714285714≈0.22857142857.

So 1.42857142856 +0.22857142857=1.6571428571.

So E=21.428571428 +1.6571428571=23.085714285 GeV.

Wait, that's about 23.086 GeV, which is close to option B)23.069 GeV.

But that can't be right because the nucleus's mass shouldn't be that high. I think I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps I should abandon this approach and stick to the initial method, which gave me about 20.12 GeV, close to option C)20.132 GeV. So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor and \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy (\( E_0 \)) of the Li-6 nucleus
Li-6 consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the atomic mass unit (\( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

- Proton mass: \( 1.007276 \, \text{u} \)
- Neutron mass: \( 1.008664 \, \text{u} \)

The total mass of the Li-6 nucleus is:

\[
m_0 = 3 \times 1.007276 + 3 \times 1.008664 = 6.04782 \, \text{u}
\]

The rest mass energy is:

\[
E_0 = m_0 c^2 = 6.04782 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5633.574 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6336 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\( E \))
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma E_0 = 3.5714 \times 5.6336 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6336 = 2.263
\]

\[
E = 17.857 + 2.263 = 20.120 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.120 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which accounts for minor rounding differences in intermediate steps.

ANSWER: C
