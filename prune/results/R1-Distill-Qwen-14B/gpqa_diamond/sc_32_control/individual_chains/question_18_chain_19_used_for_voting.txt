Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, does the mass matter here? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the element abundances given.

The elemental abundances are provided using the EW (equivalent width) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The values given are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I need to figure out the silicon ratio. Oh, wait, the ratio is [Si/Star_2] or something else? No, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need (Si in Star_1) / (Si in Star_2).

But how do I find that? The given values are ratios between different elements, so I'll need to relate them somehow.

Let me think about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is a logarithmic scale, right? So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - (log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun). Or wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

Wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ) = log10( (n_X / n_Y) ) - log10( (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) )

But I'm a bit confused. Let me get back. The problem gives me [Fe/H] for Star_1 and [Mg/H] for Star_2. And [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, but I think I might have that backwards. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals something. For the Sun, that's 7.5 for Fe. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Okay, so for the Sun:

nFe/nH = 1e-4.5, and nMg/nH=1e-5.

Now, for Star_1 and Star_2, what do the given ratios tell us?

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) in Star_1 minus the same in the Sun. So [Fe/H] = log( (nFe1/nH1) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0 → (nFe1/nH1)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) =10^0=1 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, for Star_1, the ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = 1e-4.5.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi1/nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

We can write this as log10( (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

We know nSi_sun/nFe_sun from the Sun's composition. Wait, nFe_sun is 1e-4.5 (from Sun's Fe/H), and nSi_sun is... Hmm, the Sun’s nSi isn't given directly. Oh wait, the Sun's nMg is given, but not nSi. Hmm. So I might need to find nSi_sun from other data?

Wait, maybe I can get it from the [Mg/Si] ratios. Oh, but that's for Star_2. Wait, wait. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. But let's first handle Star_1.

In Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

We need nSi_sun. Wait, do we have any other data about the Sun's Si? Hmm, no, the problem only gives Fe and Mg for the Sun. So maybe I can relate Mg and Si through the [Mg/Si] ratio in Star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nSi_sun by considering another approach. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can express the Si abundance in terms of Mg, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by expressing the ratios in terms of the Sun's ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the Si abundance in Star_1 relative to H.

Let me think. Let's compute nSi1 in terms of nH1. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1, nFe1 = (nH1) * 1e-4.5.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

Wait, nSi_sun/nFe_sun is (nSi_sun) / (nFe_sun) ) → but I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H], since [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H]. Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H], because [X/Y] - [Z/Y] = [X/Z].

So [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which means log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

So I know nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun/nH_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Mg and Si in the Sun via some other ratio. Wait, the [Mg/Si] ratio in Star_2 is given as 0.3, but for the Sun, I don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio from the given data. Let me check.

The Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si]. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can find nSi_sun from other elements, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, maybe I should look at Star_2. For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → which means log(nMg2/nH2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg2/nSi2) ) - log( nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) ) =0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun, so I can't proceed directly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can write expressions for nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH1 and nH2, respectively. Then find the ratio (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 / nH2) )? Or wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's (nSi1 / nH1 ) / (nSi2 / nH2 ) ) * (nH2 / nH1 )? Wait, no, the ratio would be (nSi1 / nH1 ) / (nSi2 / nH2 ) ) * (nH2 / nH1 )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the number density of silicon in Star_1 is nSi1, and in Star_2 it's nSi2. The ratio would be (nSi1 / (nH1)) / (nSi2 / (nH2)) ) * (nH1/nH2)? No, I think I'm mixing things. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps for each star, the ratio of silicon to hydrogen is [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

But I'm trying to find the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) → which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) = (nSi1 nH2) / (nH1 nSi2) )

Hmm, but I don't know nH1 or nH2. Oh wait, the number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere might be the same as in the Sun? No, that can't be right. Because the stars have different masses, but maybe in the photosphere, the number of hydrogen atoms is dominated by the star's composition, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the ratio of nH is the same as in the Sun. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the stars' overall compositions beyond the given elemental ratios. So perhaps we can assume that nH1 and nH2 are the same as nH_sun. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio in terms of [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, another approach: express [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then find (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) =10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX_sun/nY_sun). So if I have [Si/H] for each star, the ratio would be 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) + ([H_sun]/[H_sun]) ) } → but wait, since [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun). So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 + [nH_sun]/[nH_sun]_star} }? Hmm, maybe this is getting too tangled.

Wait, alternatively, let me compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0, so [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → nFe1/(nH1)=nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

But nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nH1) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun).

So, substituting into nSi1:

nSi1 = (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3} → nSi1 = (nH1 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun)) ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

nSi1 = nH1 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) *10^{0.3} → which is [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, no. Because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3) ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log(10^0.3) ) =0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's compute [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/H]_2=0 → so nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}.

But nMg2 = (nH2) * (nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) → because [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So, substituting into nMg2/nSi2:

(nH2 * (nMg_sun/nH_sun)) ) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = [nH2 * (nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3} ) ] → simplifying.

nSi2 = (nH2) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun) ) / (10^{0.3} )

The nMg_sun terms cancel, so:

nSi2 = (nH2) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) / 10^{0.3}.

So, nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) / 10^{0.3}.

Therefore, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( [nSi_sun/nH_sun * 10^{-0.3} ] ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

→ log(10^{-0.3}) ) = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Now, the ratio of Si in Star_1 to that in Star_2 is (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2 ) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [X/H]_1 = log(nX1/nH1) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) → so nX1/nH1 = (nX_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{ [X/H]_1 }.

Similarly for Star_2. So the ratio is (nX1/nH1)/(nX2/nH2) ) = [ (nX_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{ [X/H]_1 } ] / [ (nX_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{ [X/H]_2 } ] ) = 10^{ [X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2 }.

In this case, X is Si. So:

Ratio = 10^{ (0.3) - (-0.3) } = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. So approximately 3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would match this.

Wait, but what about the H in each star? Oh, because the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ), and the H densities in each star might be different. But in the way we derived it, the ratio is 10^{0.6}, so no H dependence. Because when we took the ratio, the nH1 and nH2 canceled out. Because nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} → same for nSi2/nH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because in Star_1, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3}, and in Star_2, nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

So the ratio is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) = (10^{0.3})/(10^{-0.3}) )=10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the answer is approximately 3.98, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ) - log₁₀(nₓ,nᵧ)_sun.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → nFe₁/nH₁ = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10⁻⁴.⁵.
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → log₁₀(nSi₁/nFe₁) - log₁₀(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → nSi₁/nFe₁ = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) × 10⁰.³.
   - Since nFe₁/nH₁ = nFe_sun/nH_sun, we find nSi₁/nH₁ = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) × 10⁰.³. Thus, [Si/H]₁ = 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → nMg₂/nH₂ = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10⁻⁵.
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → log₁₀(nMg₂/nSi₂) - log₁₀(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = 0.3 → nMg₂/nSi₂ = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) × 10⁰.³.
   - Substituting nMg₂ = (nH₂ × nMg_sun/nH_sun), we find nSi₂/nH₂ = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) × 10⁻⁰.³. Thus, [Si/H]₂ = -0.3.

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Ratio}}{\text{Si in Star_1}}{\text{Si in Star_2}} = \frac{nSi₁/nH₁}{nSi₂/nH₂} = 10^{[Si/H]₁ - [Si/H]₂}.
   \]
   Substituting [Si/H]₁ = 0.3 and [Si/H]₂ = -0.3:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to option **A**.
