Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's start by understanding what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax angle. So, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. Right, since plx = 1/distance (in parsecs).

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions or maybe in some volume. But wait, how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax range?

I think I should model this. Let me consider the volume of space at a certain distance that corresponds to a small change in parallax. Because parallax is inversely related to distance, a small change in plx would correspond to a certain volume of space.

So, if I have a parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. If I increase the parallax by a small amount δplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's see, δd would be the change in distance. Since d = 1/plx, then δd ≈ - (1/plx²) δplx. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of small increments. For a small δplx, the corresponding δd is approximately (1/plx²) * δplx, but with a negative sign because as plx increases, distance decreases.

But wait, I'm more interested in the volume. The number of stars depends on the volume because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So number of stars N in a volume V would be N = n * V. So I need to find V as a function of plx for a certain δplx.

What's the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness δd? The volume of a shell is 4πd² δd. So substituting d = 1/plx and δd = (1/plx²) δplx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) δplx. Let me compute that: 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) δplx = 4π (1/plx^4) δplx.

Wait, that seems right. So the volume for a given δplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (because n is constant), then the number of stars per unit δplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, per δplx, the number is ~ 1/plx^4. So the number density per unit plx would vary as 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the right answer.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Another approach: think about the differential number of stars dN as a function of plx.

dN = n * dV.

But dV for a given plx is the volume between plx and plx + dplx. So, V = [4π (1/plx)^2 ] * [ (dplx)/( (1/plx)^2 ) ) ].

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me express dV in terms of plx.

dV = 4π d^2 dd, where d is the distance. But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because when plx increases, d decreases. So, the change in distance dd is negative when dplx is positive. But since we're taking the absolute value for volume, maybe I can ignore the sign.

So, V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ (1/plx²) dplx ]

So V = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, dN = n * V = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx range (like dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's the number per unit plx, which is dN/dplx, which equals (n *4π)/plx^4.

So that's option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. For a small change in parallax, \( \delta \text{plx} \), the corresponding change in distance is \( \delta d \approx -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \delta \text{plx} \).

The number of stars in a given volume depends on the number density of stars, \( n \), which is constant due to the uniform distribution. The relevant volume for a small change in parallax corresponds to a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \delta d \). The volume of this shell is:

\[
V = 4\pi d^2 \delta d.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( \delta d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \delta \text{plx} \), the volume becomes:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \delta \text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \delta \text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, so:

\[
dN \propto V \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \delta \text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax, \( \frac{dN}{\delta \text{plx}} \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This matches option A.
