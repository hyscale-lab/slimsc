Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But the main thing is about the temperature. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio of two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? Because it's in LTE, so local thermodynamic equilibrium applies. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher than with. We need the factor (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, let me think. The ratio is n1/n2. So if the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower, because when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K).

Wait, but wait. The spots cause the overall temperature of the photosphere to decrease. So without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So the question is about how the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels changes when the temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, but in the star without spots, the Teff is higher. So the temperature in the photosphere when spots are present is lower. So, the ratio n1/n2 depends on temperature. Let me think about how the ratio behaves with temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)). So if E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 increases, because the denominator (exp(...)) becomes smaller. So higher T means higher n1/n2, assuming that the energy difference E2-E1 is fixed.

Wait, let's clarify. E2 is higher than E1. So E2-E1 is positive. So the exponent is negative. So exp(-delta/(kT)).

So when T increases, delta/(kT) decreases because T is in the denominator. So the exponent becomes less negative, so the entire exp term becomes larger. Wait, because exponentiating a less negative number gives a larger result. So for example, exp(-10) is a very small number, but exp(-5) is bigger than that.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term increases. So n1/n2 increases with T.

So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 should be lower. Which is what the problem states. So without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, so the ratio is higher. When spots are present, Teff is 5500 K, so ratio is lower.

Now, the question is: what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does? So it's the ratio (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (n1/n2)_5500K.

But wait, the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-delta/(kT)). So the factor is [ (g1/g2) * exp(-delta/(k*6000)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp(-delta/(k*5500)) ) ]

Wait, but the g1/g2 terms would cancel out, assuming they're the same for both situations. So the factor becomes exp( (delta/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Because when you divide, the exponents subtract. So:

exp( [ -delta/(k*6000) + delta/(k*5500) ] ) = exp( delta/k (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because 1/6000 is subtracted from 1/5500. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (3,300,000) ) = 1/(6600)

Wait, so the exponent is delta * (1/6600) / k.

Wait, no: the exponent is (delta/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (delta/(k)) * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )) ) = (delta/(k)) * (500/(3,300,000)) ) = delta/(k) * (1/6600) )

So the factor is exp( delta/(k * 6600) )

But I don't know delta. Because the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy delta is related to the photon's energy.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / lambda.

But wait, in this context, the energy difference between the two levels is the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions between them. So delta = E2 - E1 = hc / lambda.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So let me compute delta in terms of J (joules), but maybe I can find it in terms of eV or something more manageable.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute delta/(k) in terms of temperature, because the exponent will involve delta/(k T), but here we're dealing with delta/(k * 6600), so let me compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, so the factor is exp( (delta/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, no: wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta/(k*6000)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta/(k*5500)) ) ]

So it's exp( (delta/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is exp( (delta/(k)) ( (6000 -5500) ) / (5500*6000) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this exponent numerically.

Let me compute the exponent part: (delta/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)

Wait, 1/5500 is approximately 1.818e-4 (since 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1)
1/6000 is approximately 1.667e-4.

So the difference is 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (1/5500) - (1/6000) = [6000 -5500] / (5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) = 1/(66,000) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is (delta/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) = (delta/(k)) * (1/66000) )

Wait, let's compute delta/(k) first.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K.

delta is the energy difference between the levels, which is hc/lambda.

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 2.99792458e8 m/s

lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

So delta = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J·s)(2.998e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m )

Let me compute that.

First, 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = approx 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.37e-18 J.

So delta ≈ 1.37e-18 J.

Now, delta/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.37e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) ≈ 9.93e4 ≈ ~99,300 K.

So, delta/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, the exponent is (delta/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) = 99300 K * (1/66000 K^-1 )

Wait, because earlier, the difference is 1/66000. So 99300 * (1/66000) ) ≈ 99300 / 66000 ≈ 1.5045.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5045.

So the factor is exp(1.5045) ≈ e^1.5045.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.5045 is a bit more. Let me compute e^1.5045.

Let me think: e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. e^0.0045 is approximately 1.0045. So 4.4817 * 1.0045 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.0045 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.02017 ≈ 4.5019.

So exp(1.5045) ≈ ~4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, delta = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 2.998e8 m/s.

lambda = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = let's compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, more accurately:

6.626 *2.998 ≈ 19.852, so 19.852e-34+8= 19.852e-26? Wait, 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = 6.626 * 2.998 = ~19.84, and exponents 1e-34 *1e8 = 1e-26. So 19.84e-26 J·m.

So hc = 1.984e-25 J·m? Wait, wait, 19.84e-26 is 1.984e-25.

Then delta = hc/lambda = (1.984e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approx 1.984e-25 / 1.448e-7 = let's compute that.

1.984e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.984 / 1.448) ) * 1e-25+7 = 1.37 * 1e-18 = 1.37e-18 J. So that's correct.

delta/(k) = 1.37e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.37 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 ≈ 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99,300 K.

So that's correct.

Then, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So delta/k * (1/5500 -1/6000) ) = 99300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99300 * 0.00001515.

Wait, 99300 * 0.00001515 = ?

Let me compute 100,000 * 0.00001515 = 1.515.

But since it's 99300, which is 99.3% of 100,000, it's 1.515 * 0.993 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is about 1.505.

e^1.505 is, as before, approx 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, so option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio depends on the exponential term \( \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right) \), which changes with temperature.

The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition, given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the transition. Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, we compute \( \Delta E / k \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.37 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \) is calculated as:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = 99,300 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.505.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

This matches option **C**.
