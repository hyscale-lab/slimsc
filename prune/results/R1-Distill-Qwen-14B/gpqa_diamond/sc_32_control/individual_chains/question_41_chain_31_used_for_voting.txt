Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. Oh right, when light travels through a medium, its speed is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving. So I think I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the speed of light measured by the observer.

Hmm, so maybe this involves special relativity? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, the usual Galilean addition doesn't work. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is something like u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c^2)), but that applies when you're transforming between frames moving at velocity v relative to each other.

Wait, but here, the medium's moving. So the light's speed in the medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame. So in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer? Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving "toward the observer in laboratory." Wait, the direction is important. Let me parse the question again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, how can a glass moving toward the observer have the beam moving in the same direction? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity—so the beam is moving towards the observer as well. But wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is moving towards the observer too.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. Let me think about the setup. The glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer and in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, perhaps toward the observer as well. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, maybe I should consider frames. Let me model this. Let's say in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, no, the lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity transformation. But wait, the velocity of the light in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v, I can use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed in the lab frame.

But wait, wait. The direction matters. Let me define the coordinate system. Let's say the glass is moving in the positive x-direction at velocity v in the lab frame. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, so in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the positive x-direction.

Wait, no. In the glass's rest frame, light propagates at c/n, which is less than c. Now, to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we can use the Lorentz velocity transformation. The formula for velocity addition is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2)), but wait, I think I have to be careful with the signs.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, the glass's speed is v. The light in the glass's frame is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when we transform to the lab frame, the speed of the light is u_lab = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2))?

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity transformation formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2)), where u is the velocity in the glass frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. So if in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (so u and v are same direction), then the lab frame would see the light moving at u_lab = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check. The formula is for when the frames are moving relative to each other. So if the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then the velocity of light in the lab frame is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

But wait, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame. So u = c/n. So plugging in, u_lab = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Simplify denominator:

Denominator = 1 + (v/(c n)).

So u_lab = [ (c + n v) /n ] / [ (c n + v)/(c n) ) ].

Wait, let me compute it step by step. Numerator: (c/n + v) = (c + v n)/(n). Denominator: 1 + (v c)/(n c^2) ) = 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c).

So u_lab = [ (c + v n) /n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ (c + v n)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancel:

= [ (c + v n) * c ] / (n c + v )

Factor c + n v = n c + v? Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, c + n v is the same as n v + c, which is the same as the denominator n c + v? No, wait. For example, if c=3, n=2, v=1: c +n v =3+2=5, denominator n c +v=6+1=7. So they're not the same.

Wait, so denominator is n c + v.

Wait, wait, the numerator is (c +n v)*c, denominator is (n c + v).

So:

= [ c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that's not any of the options. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, my expression is [c (c +n v)] / (n c + v). But c is 1 according to the problem. So substituting c=1:

= [1*(1 +n v)] / (n *1 +v ) = (1 +n v)/(n +v)

That's option A. So the speed would be (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving towards the observer, then the velocity v is towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light is higher than c/n, right? Because the medium itself is moving.

But wait, in this calculation, when the glass is moving at v, the light's speed in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Let me take an example. Suppose n=1 (vacuum), and v is small, say v=0.1. Then the speed would be (1 +1*0.1)/(1 +0.1) = 1.1 /1.1 = 1. Which makes sense because in vacuum, the speed is c regardless of the motion of the medium. Oh wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, so if n=1, the speed should be 1 regardless of v. So in that case, option A gives (1+ v)/(1 +v )= 1. Which is correct.

Another example: if n=2, v=0. Then speed is (1+0)/ (2+0)= 1/2, which is correct as c/n=0.5.

If n=2, v=0.2, then speed is (1 + 0.4)/(2 +0.2)=1.4/2.2 ≈ 0.636 c. That seems reasonable.

Wait, but what if the direction is such that the glass is moving in the opposite direction? Suppose the glass is moving in the opposite direction of the light. Then the velocity would be negative, so u = ( (c/n) - v ) / (1 - (c/n v)/c² ) ?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So same direction. So our earlier approach holds.

Therefore, the correct formula is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A. So the answer must be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the motion of the medium and the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{u_{\text{glass}} + v}{1 + \frac{u_{\text{glass}} v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)) and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( u_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider special cases:

1. If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light is always \( c = 1 \), regardless of \( v \). Substituting \( n = 1 \) into \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is correct.
2. If \( v = 0 \), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), consistent with the formula \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \).

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to option A.
