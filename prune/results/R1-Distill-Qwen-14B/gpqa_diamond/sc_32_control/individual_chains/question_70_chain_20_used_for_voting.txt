Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes several reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm.

Let me break down the information step by step. First, I'll list all the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I should start by figuring out what each of these compounds could be. Let's take reaction 4 first because it's a simple 1:1 ratio between D and B forming H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But considering the other reactions, perhaps something else.

Wait, if D and B form H, and H is a solvent, let's think of common solvents. Maybe H is something like water. But water is H2O, so if H is H2O, then D and B would be O2 and H2? But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but then D and B would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps H is an ether. For example, diethyl ether is a solvent. Diethyl ether is formed from two equivalents of ethanol, but here the ratio is 1:1. Wait, but maybe D and B are something else. Alternatively, H could be an alcohol like ethanol, but that's made from, say, CO2 and H2, which might not fit.

Wait, maybe H is something like NH3? No, that's a gas. Hmm. Maybe H is something like HCl gas? No, that's a gas too. Wait, but the solvent could be something like ethanol. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about reaction 3.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, the products are A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So, when C is reacted with H2O, it breaks down into A and two acids. That makes me think of a reaction where a salt is being hydrolyzed. For example, maybe a sulfide reacting with water to produce a metal hydroxide and some acid.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's think. If I have, say, CuS reacting with water. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride? For example, Ca3N2 reacting with water to produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But that might not fit with the strong and weak acids.

Wait, the products are two acids. So, like when a metal carbonate reacts with water, but no, that gives CO2 and a base. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is an acidic oxide. For example, maybe it's something like SO3 reacting with water to form H2SO4 (a strong acid) and... wait, that would only give one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, if C is sodium sulfite, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into NaOH (a base) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But in that case, F would be a strong base, not acid—so that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a more complex compound. Let's think about possible compounds that when reacted with water produce two acids. Maybe a double acid? Or perhaps a salt that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction of A and B to form C. A is a solid, B is a gas. 8 equivalents of B reacting with A to make C. That suggests a high ratio. Maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. But what solid reacts with Cl2 in such a way?

Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2. So, for example, sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But that's 2 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of Na. But here, it's 8 equivalents. Hmm. Maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high chlorination product. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, and A is a metal that forms an oxide. But 8 equivalents sounds high.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2. So A is a metal, and B is H2 gas. 8 equivalents of H2 reacting with A (a metal) to form a hydride. Wait, but which metal hydrides are bright red? Not sure.

Another thought: the bright red product C. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide (which is red), but that's a solid, but wait, in reaction 4, H is a solvent formed from D and B. So perhaps H is H2O, meaning D and B are O2 and H2? But that would mean D is O2 and B is H2, or vice versa.

Wait, but if B is H2, then in reaction 1, solid A reacts with 8 moles of H2 to form C. What solid reacts with H2 in such a way? Maybe a transition metal like iron reacting to form FeH2 or something. But I'm not sure about the red color.

Alternatively, let's think of a different approach. Let's look at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous substances in chemistry might be things like sarin gas, but perhaps in this context, it's something else, like a highly toxic gas.

Wait, if E is a toxic gas, perhaps it's something like HCl, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe it's a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's a gas), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about H again. H is a solvent formed by D and B in a 1:1 ratio. So, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. That's a common solvent. If H is H2O, then D must be O2 and B must be H2. Let me check that.

So, if reaction 4: B + D → H. If B is H2, D is O2, then H is H2O. That makes sense. So B is H2, D is O2.

So going back to reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). So what solid reacts with H2 in a high ratio to form a red product?

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal. Let's think of metal + H2 → metal hydride. But what red hydrides do I know? Not many. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. Wait, but that might not involve H2.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with H2. For example, CuO reacts with H2 to form Cu and H2O. But that's a reaction with H2 as a reducing agent. But the product wouldn't be red necessarily, unless it's copper.

Wait, solid copper is reddish. So maybe A is CuO, and when it reacts with H2, it forms Cu and H2O. But that would be a reduction. But the problem states that A reacts with H2 to form C. So if A is CuO, C could be Cu, which is red.

Wait, but Cu is a solid. But in reaction 2, C reacts with D (O2) to form E. So if C is Cu, then reaction 2 would be Cu reacting with O2 to form CuO again? But that's not producing a new product, just cycling. Alternatively, maybe there's a different reaction.

Wait, but reaction 2 uses 2 equivalents of D, which is O2. So maybe Cu reacts with O2 under certain conditions to form CuO, but that's just the reverse of the first reaction. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with H2. But FeS is a black solid. Not sure.

Wait another thought: Maybe A is a metal carbonate. But when a metal carbonate reacts with H2, it's more about reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacting with H2. But I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is something else. Let's think about the product C. It reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives back A and two acids.

So if C when hydrolyzed yields A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid), perhaps C is a salt. When a salt is hydrolyzed, it can produce an acid and a base. But in this case, it's yielding two acids. That's a bit unusual. Wait, unless C is a complex salt or something that can release multiple acids.

Wait, another possibility: C might be a sulfite or sulfide. For example, if C is Na2S, then reacting with water would produce 2NaOH and H2S. But that would give a base and a weak acid. But in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a metal bisulfide? Or perhaps a mixed salt.

Alternatively, let's think of a metal that forms a compound which, upon hydrolysis, gives two different acids. For example, maybe C is a metal nitrate or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. If C is CaCO3, then hydrolysis would produce Ca(OH)2 (a base) and CO2 (a weak acid). But that's one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, AlN reacts with water to produce NH3 (a weak base) and Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric). But that doesn't give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce 2NaOH and O2. That gives a base and a gas, not two acids.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about the products in reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

If F is a strong acid like HCl, and G is a weak acid like H3PO4, but that seems random. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak). But how would that happen?

Wait, if C is a sulfate ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes into 2NaOH and H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, so one strong (NaOH is a base, so that's not matching F and G as acids). Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two acids.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal bisulfate or something. For example, if C is something like (NH4)2SO4, but that's ammonium sulfate, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). That would fit F as H2SO4 (strong) and G as NH4OH (weak). But then A would be NH4OH? Or maybe A is the metal part.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts. I'm getting stuck here, maybe I should think about the first reaction again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). If B is H2, then 8 H2 per mole of A. What reaction would that be?

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a hydride. For example, sodium hydride (NaH) is a solid, but that's 1 H2 per Na. Not 8. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal. Let's think of a reaction where a metal reacts with H2 in a high ratio to form a compound.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe and B is H2. Fe reacts with H2 to form FeH2? But I don't think that's a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where multiple H2 molecules add to a metal.

Wait, maybe the product is a metal hydride like LiH. But that's 1 H2 per Li. Still not 8.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a metal oxide reacting with H2. For example, WO3 + H2 → W + H2O. But then C would be W, which is a metal, not necessarily red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide, like CuO reacting with H2 to form Cu and H2O. But Cu is red, which fits the bright red product.

Wait, let me think. If A is CuO (a solid), and B is H2 (gas), then 8 equivalents of H2 would mean 8 moles of H2 per mole of CuO. But the reaction would be:

2 CuO + H2 → 2 Cu + H2O. Wait, that reaction would require 1 mole of H2 per mole of CuO, not 8. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe B isn't H2. Let me think about other possibilities for B and D.

In reaction 4, B and D form H, which is a solvent. If H is ethanol, then B and D would be something that forms ethanol. For example, if B is CH3CH2X and D is H2O, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is methanol. Then B and D would be CO and H2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe H is an ether, like diethyl ether. To make diethyl ether, you need two equivalents of ethanol and a dehydrating agent. But the reaction ratio would be 1:1 for the reactants if B and D are ethanol and something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps H is an alcohol. For example, ethanol is produced from carbon monoxide and hydrogen (CO + 3 H2 → CH3CH2OH, catalyst). So in that case, B would be H2 and D would be CO. Then reaction 4 would be CO + H2 → CH3CH2OH. That would mean B is H2 and D is CO. So in reaction 4, D is CO, B is H2. Then in reaction 1, A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). Hmm.

So then, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid reacts with H2 in such a high ratio? Maybe a transition metal that forms a hydride. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where H2 is acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal oxide and B is H2, and the reaction is a reduction. For example, Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O. But that's a 4 H2 per Fe3O4. Not 8. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with H2 to form Ca, CO, and H2O. But I don't think that's a typical reaction.

Hmm, perhaps A is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2 → MgH2 + NH3. But the stoichiometry isn't clear.

Wait, but the product is bright red. That makes me think of mercury(II) oxide, which is red. So if C is HgO, then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2 → HgO.

But what would A be in that case? Maybe HgO is the product, so A is Hg and B is O2? Wait, no, because B is a gas. Wait, no, in reaction 1, A is the solid. So maybe A is HgO and B is H2. Let's think:

HgO (solid) + H2 (gas) → Hg (red solid) + H2O. But the stoichiometry here is 2 HgO + H2 → 2 Hg + H2O. So that would be 0.5 moles of H2 per mole of HgO. Not 8. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the wrong path. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If D is CO, as per the earlier thought, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 CO → E.

But what would E be? Maybe a toxic compound like a cyanide or something. Alternatively, if D is O2, reaction 2 would be C + O2 → E. For example, if C is a metal, like Cu, then O2 would form CuO. But that's not a highly hazardous product, I think.

Wait, but perhaps E is a gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure how that would form. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, going back to reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. Wait, maybe C is a diacid salt. For example, if C is Na2HPO4, then hydrolysis would give 2 NaOH and H3PO4. Hmm, but that's a base and an acid. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal bisulfate, like (NH4)2SO4. Wait, when ammonium sulfate is hydrolyzed, it would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). So in that case, F would be H2SO4 and G would be NH4OH. Then A would be the ammonium ion? But A is a solid in reaction 1. So maybe A is NH4Cl or something else.

Wait, but let's tie this together. If C is (NH4)2SO4, then reaction 3 would be:

(NH4)2SO4 + H2O → 2 NH4OH + H2SO4.

But wait, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So A would be NH4OH? But that's a weak acid, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound. Let's think of a metal salt that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water to produce Ca(OH)2 and CO2. But CO2 is a weak acid, and Ca(OH)2 is a base. So that doesn't fit because we need two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a base, H2S is a weak acid. So that would give one acid and one base. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is KHSO4, then hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and KHSO4 → K+ + HSO4^- which can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but that might not produce two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like MgNH4PO4, which on hydrolysis gives Mg(OH)2, NH4OH, and H3PO4. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride or something. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the initial reactions again.

If B is H2, and D is O2, then H is H2O. So reaction 4 is B (H2) + D (O2) → H (H2O). That makes sense. So, B is H2, D is O2.

Then reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red). So, what solid + H2 in 8:1 ratio gives a red product?

Hmm, maybe A is a metal that forms a hydride. For example, perhaps it's a transition metal that adds multiple H2 molecules.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a metal with H2 giving a metal hydride. Like, perhaps, Ti reacting with H2 to form TiH2. But I don't know if that's red.

Wait, but TiH2 is a white crystalline solid. Not red. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe the reaction is a metal oxide with H2 acting as a reducing agent. For example, if A is Fe3O4, then reaction with H2 would produce Fe and H2O. But the color of Fe is silver, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but chromium(VI) compounds are yellow or orange. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, what about a sulfide? If A is FeS, and reaction with H2 produces Fe and H2S (which is a gas, so maybe not fitting as a product). Alternatively, maybe it's a different sulfide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is mercury(I) oxide, which is red. So if C is HgO, then reaction 1 would be HgO + H2 → Hg + H2O. But the stoichiometry for that is 2 HgO + H2 → 2 Hg + H2O. So that's 0.5 H2 per HgO. Not 8. So doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction. Maybe A is something else.

Another thought: perhaps A is a nitride. For example, AlN reacts with H2 to form Al and NH3. But the product would be Al, which is silvery, not red.

Wait, maybe A is a sulfide, and C is a metal. For example, CuS is a black solid. Reaction with H2 might not produce red.

Alternatively, maybe A is a carbonate. Let's say A is Na2CO3. Reacting with H2, maybe it's a reduction. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to think about reaction 2 again. C reacts with 2 D (O2) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So if C is a metal, like Cu, then reacting with O2 would form CuO, which isn't extremely hazardous. But perhaps C is a more reactive metal.

Wait, another idea: if C is a metal like sodium, then reacting with O2 would form NaO2 (sodium peroxide), which is a possible product. Sodium peroxide is a white solid. But is that extremely hazardous? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is phosphorus. White phosphorus is bright red, so that's a possibility. Phosphorus reacts with O2 to form P4O10, which is a white powder. But that's when it's burned in excess O2. Hmm.

Wait, but in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of O2 to form E. So 1 mole of C reacts with 2 moles of O2. If C is P (white or red?), but red phosphorus is a solid. Let me think: red phosphorus is a solid, right? So if C is red phosphorus, then reaction 2 would be P + 2 O2 → P4O10. Wait, but the stoichiometry of that reaction is 4 P + 5 O2 → 2 P4O10. So 4 P need 5 O2. So 1 P would need 5/4 O2. But in reaction 2, it's 2 O2 per C. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe C is another compound. Perhaps C is a sulfur compound. Sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Wait, but perhaps it's another form. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form is red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal oxide that's red. Maybe manganese oxide? I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps I should consider the symmetry of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I remember that symmetry groups are based on the shape of the molecule. For example, D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry and an infinite axis. Molecules like CO2 (linear) have D∞h symmetry, but CO2 is a gas, not necessarily hazardous. Wait, but phosgene (O=C=O) is a gas, highly toxic, and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then it's O=C=O, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. That would make option C) D∞h the answer.

But wait, how does that fit into the reactions?

Let me piece it together:

- Reaction 4: B (H2) + D (O2) → H (H2O). So H is water.

- Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). If C is phosgene (O=C=O), then how would that form from a solid A and H2?

Wait, no, phosgene is a gas, not a solid. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 O2 → phosgene. But phosgene's formation usually involves reacting CO with Cl2, but that's in the presence of a catalyst.

Wait, perhaps reaction 2 is the formation of phosgene from C and O2. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let me think about other highly toxic gases. For example, sarin gas has a certain symmetry, but I don't know its point group.

Alternatively, maybe E is SO2, which is a toxic gas. SO2 has a bent structure, which would fall under the C2v symmetry group. Because a bent molecule like SO2 has a plane of symmetry and a C2 axis, making its point group C2v.

Wait, but SO2 is a bent molecule. Its symmetry elements include a C2 axis (the bond axis), two mirror planes that include the C2 axis, and a perpendicular plane bisecting the angle. So the point group would be C2v.

Looking back at the options, option D is C2v.

If E is SO2, let's see if the reactions fit.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 O2 → E (SO2). So, if C is S, then reaction would be S + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. But that would require 1 mole of S reacting with 2 moles of O2, which is correct. So that fits.

Then, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (S). So, A is a solid that reacts with H2 to form S. But wait, S is a solid, so perhaps A is a higher sulfur compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps reaction 1 is the formation of S from a metal thiol or something. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal sulfide, which upon reaction with H2 produces S and H2S. But that doesn't fit with 8 H2.

Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and H2 is reacting to form S and something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 1 is the reduction of a higher sulfur compound to S. For example, if A is a metal sulfide like FeS8 (which is a possible structure for elemental sulfur), then reaction with H2 might produce S and H2S. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Wait, but elemental sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Hmm, that's a problem because C is described as bright red. So maybe that's not the case.

Another highly toxic gas with a known symmetry: Cl2O is dichlorine monoxide, but I'm not sure about its structure.

Alternatively, maybe E is HCl gas, but HCl is a simple gas with a single bond, so it's linear, making its symmetry D∞h. But I don't think HCl is extremely hazardous, though.

Wait, another highly toxic gas is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which is a linear molecule, so D∞h symmetry. But how would that fit into the reactions?

So, if E is HCN, then reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → HCN. But that doesn't make sense because HCN is formed from reactions involving CN- and H+.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is the oxidation of C to form E. If C is carbon, then reaction could be C + 2 O2 → CO2, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, maybe E is NO (nitric oxide), which is a toxic gas. NO is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. Let's see:

Reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → 2 NO. Wait, that doesn't make sense because NO is formed via the reduction of O2, not by adding O2.

Wait, the formation of NO occurs in the reaction 4 NO2 → 2 NO + O2, but that's decomposition, not formation.

Alternatively, if C is a metal, like Pb, reacting with O2 to form PbO2. But I don't know if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ozone (O3), which has a bent structure and a C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas. Let's see reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → O3. That doesn't fit the stoichiometry. Ozone is formed from O2 via light, not via reaction with another substance.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of E as a compound with D∞h symmetry, which would be option C. What compounds have D∞h symmetry? They are linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple planes of symmetry. Examples include CO2, H2O (but it's bent, not linear), O3 (bent, C2v), and phosgene (O=C=O).

Wait, phosgene is O=C=O, which is linear. So its symmetry group is D∞h. But how would phosgene fit into the reactions?

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 O2 → phosgene.

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst, but that's not involving O2.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is the oxidation of a carbonyl chloride to phosgene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different compound. Another thought: maybe E is diphosgene, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another approach: if E is phosgene, then reaction 2 is C + 2 O2 → phosgene. But I don't know any such reaction. Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated compound reacting with O2 to form phosgene, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another possibility. Let's think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C is a compound that when hydrolyzed produces two acids.

If F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3 (another strong acid?), that doesn't fit because G is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H3PO4 (weak). So how would C produce those?

Wait, if C is (NH4)2SO4, then hydrolysis would give NH4OH (weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). That fits F and G. So A would be NH4OH. But A is a solid in reaction 1, which doesn't fit because NH4OH is a liquid or gas.

Hmm, perhaps A is a different compound. Maybe A is NH4Cl, which is a solid. Then, in reaction 1, NH4Cl (solid) reacts with 8 H2 to form C (some compound) which when hydrolyzed gives back NH4Cl, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). This seems a bit forced.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, Al2(SO4)3. When it hydrolyzes, it would produce Al(OH)3 and H2SO4. But Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should quickly recap:

- B is H2, D is O2, H is H2O.

- Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). So what solid reacts with 8 H2 to form red product C.

- Reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → E (extremely hazardous).

- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If C is a metal, say Fe, which is silvery, not red. Alternatively, if C is a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is CuS. Reacting with O2 would form CuO and SO2. But SO2 is a toxic gas with C2v symmetry, as I thought earlier.

So, if E is SO2, then its symmetry group is C2v (option D). Let me see if that fits.

Reaction 2: C (CuS) + 2 O2 → SO2 + CuO.

Wait, the reaction would be 2 CuS + 3 O2 → 2 CuO + 2 SO2. So in that case, 2 moles of CuS react with 3 moles of O2 to produce 2 moles of SO2. But the question says 2 equivalents of D (O2) are used. So 2 O2 per C. That would require for 1 mole of C (CuS), 2 moles O2 to produce 1 mole SO2. So perhaps the reaction is CuS + 2 O2 → CuO + 2 SO2. Wait, but that doesn't balance. Let me check:

CuS + 2 O2 → CuO + 2 SO2.

Left side: Cu:1, S:1, O:4.

Right side: Cu:1, O:1 (from CuO) + 2*(S:1, O:2) = S:2, O:5.

Wait, that's CuS + 2 O2 → CuO + 2 SO2.

So, S on left:1, on right:2. That's a problem. So that doesn't balance.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is 2 CuS + 3 O2 → 2 CuO + 2 SO2.

Then, moles of O2:3 per 2 moles of CuS. So per mole of CuS, 1.5 O2. Not 2, but perhaps it's close enough for the problem.

But wait, the problem states 2 equivalents of D (O2) are used. So for 1 mole of C, 2 moles of O2 are consumed. So perhaps the reaction is adjusted to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is FeS. Reacting with O2 to form FeO and SO2.

FeS + 2 O2 → FeO + 2 SO2.

Check stoichiometry:

Fe:1, S:1, O:4 → Fe:1, O:1 + S:2, O:4 → O total on right:5, on left:4. So that doesn't balance.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about the symmetry again.

If E is SO2, its point group is C2v (option D). If E is phosgene, the point group is D∞h (option C).

But earlier, I thought C is bright red. If C is a solid, maybe it's a metal sulfide. For example, CuS is black, not red. FeS is black too. Wait, what about HgS? HgS is a red solid. Oh, that's a possibility.

So, if C is HgS (mercury(II) sulfide), which is red. Then reaction 3: HgS + H2O → A + F + G.

But HgS is insoluble in water, so hydrolysis might not produce two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think of another red solid. Maybe a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another form is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal carbide. But I don't know their colors.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product C is a form of sulfur. Wait, but pure sulfur is yellow. Maybe it's a different allotrope or a compound. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal that's red. For example, maybe Cu2S is black, but perhaps another sulfide.

I'm running out of time, so I'll have to make an educated guess based on the symmetry options.

If E is SO2, which has a C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D) C2v.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=C=O), which is linear, symmetry group D∞h (option C).

But considering the reactions, if E is SO2, perhaps that's more plausible.

Wait, but in reaction 2, if C is a metal sulfide reacting with O2 to form SO2, then E would be SO2, which is a toxic gas, and its symmetry is C2v.

So, putting it all together, the symmetry group of E would be C2v, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Assuming H is water (H₂O), B and D are identified as H₂ and O₂, respectively.

2. **Reaction 1**: A (a solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of H₂ to form C, described as a bright red product. This suggests C could be a compound like mercury(II) sulfide (HgS), which is red, or a transition metal compound with red coloration.

3. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of O₂ to form E, an extremely hazardous product. If C is a sulfide (e.g., CuS or FeS), reacting with O₂ could produce SO₂, a toxic gas. SO₂ is a bent molecule with a C₂v symmetry group.

4. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This aligns with the hydrolysis of a sulfide like CuS, which could produce a base and a weak acid, though the exact products depend on the specific compound.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **A) C₂**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **B) D₄h**: A high-symmetry group with multiple planes and a four-fold rotation axis.
   - **C) D∞h**: The symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite axis (e.g., CO₂ or phosgene).
   - **D) C₂v**: The symmetry of a bent molecule (e.g., SO₂).

   If E is SO₂, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry. This fits the description of E as a toxic gas formed in reaction 2. Phosgene (O=C=O), a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, is another possibility, but its formation does not align as well with the given reactions.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible product E is SO₂, which has a C₂v symmetry group.
