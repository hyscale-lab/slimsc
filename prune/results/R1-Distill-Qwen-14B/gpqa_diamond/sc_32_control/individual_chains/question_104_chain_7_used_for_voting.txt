Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are Neptune-sized, and their orbits are circular. The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method uses the Doppler shift to determine the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. The formula for K is given by something involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) multiplied by some constants, but since the masses are similar to Sun and the planets are much smaller, M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars, since both stars have the same mass as the Sun.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), M_p is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to (P^(1/3)). Because K = (constant) * (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but M_p is same for both, M_star same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3), which means P ∝ 1/(K)^3.

Wait, no, let's think again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to 1/(K^3). Because if K = C / (P^(1/3)), then P^(1/3) = C/K, so P = (C/K)^3. So P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say K1 is 5 and K2 is 7 milliangstroms. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (K)^{-3}.

So P1 / P2 = (K2 / K1)^3.

Because P ∝ 1/K^3. So P1 = (1/K1^3) * constant, and P2 = (1/K2^3) * same constant. So P1/P2 = (K2^3)/(K1^3) ) = (K2/K1)^3.

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then P1/P2 = (7/5)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. Let me write down the equation.

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * something. Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P * (1 day)) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But when M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) ).

Wait, maybe I should look for the relation between K and the orbital period P.

Alternatively, I've heard the formula that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

So, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

So if K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to 1/(K^3).

Because, from K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), rearrange to get P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K, so P ∝ (1/K)^3 → P ∝ 1/(K^3).

So the ratio of the periods P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (K)^{-3}.

So P2 = (K1 / K2)^3 * P1 ?

No, wait. Let me think in terms of the formula:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Which can be written as K = C / (P^(1/3)), where C is a constant.

So, P^(1/3) = C / K.

So, P = (C / K)^3.

So, for two different planets, P1 = (C/K1)^3, and P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is ( (C/K2)^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, that seems right. Because if K2 is larger, then P2 would be smaller, since K and P have an inverse relationship.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Suppose K doubles. Then P would be 1/(2^3) = 1/8th of the original. So yes, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

So going back to the problem: K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So that's approximately 0.36. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is 0.36, which is P2 = 0.36 * P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.

Wait, but the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's, then it's actually shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because sometimes the reciprocal is taken.

Wait, the question is about how many times longer #2's period is compared to #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter. So the answer is that it's not longer, it's shorter, but the options include ~0.36 as option A. So the ratio of P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning #2's period is 0.36 times that of #1. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the question could be phrased as "how longer", but perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, the ratio I'm finding is P2 = 0.36 P1, so how much longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer, it's shorter. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, so it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, making it shorter. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? The answer is 0.36 times, which is 36% of P1. So it is shorter, but the question is about how many times longer, so it's 0.36 times as long.

So the correct answer is option A) ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). Rearranging, \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given that the two planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the proportionality simplifies to \( P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3 \), where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of planet #1 and planet #2, respectively.

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
P_2 / P_1 = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
