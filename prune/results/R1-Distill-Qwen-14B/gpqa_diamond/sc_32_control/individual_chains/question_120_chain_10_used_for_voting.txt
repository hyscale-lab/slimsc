Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance = 1/plx.

Wait, so if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. Like, the nearest stars have larger parallaxes, and as they get farther away, the parallax decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I imagine looking at a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density in space is uniform. Wait, but uniform in space or uniform in the sky? Oh, the question says uniformly distributed in the sky, so maybe it's talking about uniform distribution in terms of spatial density. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of volume.

Wait, let's model this. Let's say that the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to that volume. So if I consider a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at a certain distance from us, the volume of that shell would determine how many stars are in it.

The shell's volume depends on the surface area and the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and if the thickness is dr, then the volume is 4π r² dr. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr is N ∝ 4π r² dr, where N is the total number in that shell and the proportionality depends on the overall density.

But the question is about parallax. Since parallax plx is 1/r (because r is in parsecs, plx in arcseconds), then r = 1/plx. So substituting r into the volume equation, let's see.

The volume element (dV) is 4π r² dr. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Since r = 1/plx, then dr is the change in r when plx changes by dplx. Let me find dr in terms of dplx.

r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, which makes sense. But since we're dealing with magnitudes in terms of dplx, I can take the absolute value. So dr = dplx / (plx²).

Substituting r = 1/plx and dr = dplx/(plx²) into the volume equation:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) )

Wait, let me see: (1/plx)^2 is 1/(plx^2), and dr is dplx/(plx^2). So multiplying them gives (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = dplx / plx^4.

So dV ∝ dplx / plx^4.

But wait, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to dV, so the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I have a small range dplx, the number of stars in that range would be proportional to dV, which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, another approach: Let me think in terms of differential number per unit parallax.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between distance r and r + dr, where r=1/plx and dr is the change in r for that dplx.

So number of stars (dN) in that range is proportional to 4π (r^2) dr.

But since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx → dr = dplx / (plx^2) (taking absolute value).

So dN ∝ 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, dN/dplx = 4π / plx^4.

Which would mean that the number per unit plx range is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be option A: ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not confusing parallax with something else. Because sometimes when you have a distribution in terms of distance, the number per unit distance changes differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using the probability distribution for parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant.

The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n multiplied by the volume between those parallax values. Let's think in terms of plx.

Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

So, the volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting, the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Because plx is positive and we're dealing with small dplx, the negative sign can be dropped.

So volume element dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

The number of stars in that volume is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as 1/plx^4. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, and as the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \), the volume element is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell. Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \): \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) into the volume element gives:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), corresponding to option A.
