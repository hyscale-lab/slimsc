Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember some basics about the speed of light and relative motion. Let me think.

First, I know that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, the speed of light inside the glass would be 1/n, since c is given as 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer in the lab sees the glass moving. So I need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the lab frame, not just in the glass's frame.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction. Hmm, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same as the light beam direction.

Wait, let's clarify: the light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, but the observer is in the lab. So the glass is moving towards the observer, which is the same direction as the light beam's propagation. So the relative motion is such that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer through the glass.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light's propagation. So the light is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, towards the observer, at velocity v.

Wait, but how does the motion of the medium (glass) affect the observed speed of light? I recall that in classical mechanics, velocities add in a particular way. But wait, for light, I think the situation is different because of relativity.

Wait, but the problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, but the glass is a medium, so the speed of light in the glass is 1/n. But when the glass is moving relative to the lab, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait a minute, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed 1/n towards the observer (since the glass is moving towards the observer, the light’s direction is same as the glass’s motion). But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, we have to consider the velocity addition.

Wait, but wait, wait. When the medium is moving, the speed of light through it as observed in the lab frame is not just the sum of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium, because that's what you might think classically. But that's not correct because of special relativity. Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, but when the medium is moving, the speed doesn't just add like that.

Wait, but wait again. The speed of light in a medium, when the medium is moving, but in this case, the light is in the medium which is moving. So perhaps the approach is to think in terms of the velocity of the light as observed from the lab frame.

Alternatively, maybe this calls for using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me recap:

In the frame where the glass is stationary, the light's speed is 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer through the glass).

So in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is v_light = (1/n) in the direction of motion.

But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the velocity of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v towards the observer (in the same direction as the light's propagation). So the lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² )

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the frames right. So the glass frame (S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). So in S' (glass's frame), the light's speed is u' = 1/n in the direction of motion (since the light is moving towards the observer, same as the glass's movement). So to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S', we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, the lab frame S sees the glass moving at velocity v in the positive x-direction (towards the observer). The glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.

Wait, in S' (glass's frame), the light is moving at u' = 1/n in the positive x-direction. So to find u, the speed in S (lab frame), we can use the velocity transformation formula.

The formula is:

u = [u' + v ] / [1 + (u' * v) / c² ]

Since c=1, this simplifies to:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Substituting u' = 1/n,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v)(1/n) )

Hmm. Let's compute that.

Let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + v n ) / n

Denominator: (n + v) / n

Wait, because 1 + (v * 1)/n = (n + v) / n.

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (1 + v n)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ] 

The n denominators cancel out.

So u = (1 + v n) / (n + v )

So u = (n v + 1) / (n + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches. Option B is 1, which would be the case if the glass's velocity doesn't affect the light's speed, but I have to choose according to the calculation.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in the problem, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the direction of the light's movement in the lab frame is the same as the glass's movement. So from the lab frame, the speed shouldn't exceed c=1, but let me see.

Wait, let's plug in some numbers. Suppose n=1 (vacuum), then the speed in the glass is 1. If the glass is moving at v, then according to the formula above, u would be (1 + v )/(1 + v )=1, which makes sense because in vacuum, the speed is always c.

Another test: when the glass is stationary, v=0. Then u=(1 + 0)/(n + 0 )=1/n, which is correct.

Another case: n=2, v=0.5. Then u = (1 + (2)(0.5)) / (2 +0.5 ) = (1+1)/(2.5 )=2/2.5=0.8. Which is less than 1, which is correct.

So the formula seems to make sense.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which is exactly what I got.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (speed of light in vacuum) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Thus, the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. To find the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Here:
- \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( u \) is the speed of light relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches the expression given in option A. To verify, consider the following cases:
1. If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light is always \( 1 \), which is consistent with the formula.
2. If \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \), as expected.
3. For \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \), the formula gives \( u = \frac{1 + 1}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is less than \( 1 \), as expected.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
