Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I think that's when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers make molecules non-superimposable mirror images, so they can rotate plane-polarized light. Cool, but I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think through each option.

The question lists four organic compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I'll go through each one by one.

First, let me understand what each structure looks like.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so it's a biphenyl structure with two phenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' (the dicarboxylate groups) and 6 and 6' (the nitro groups). Wait, does the biphenyl have any symmetry? If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe it can have a chiral center. But wait, biphenyls can have something called a biphenyl axis. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm. Let me visualize: if the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and also at 6 and 6', maybe the molecule is symmetric. Wait, but 6 and 6' are opposite positions on each ring. Wait, no, because the biphenyl is in a 1,1' linkage. So each ring is attached at position 1. So position 2 is adjacent on each ring. The 6 position would be across from 1 on each ring? So the substituents at 6 and 6' would be para to the point where the rings are connected. So looking at the structure, if the substituents at 2 and 2' are both on the same side, and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' are also on the same side, does that create any chirality?

Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is about the arrangement around the central bond between the two phenyl rings. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can have axial chirality. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe each substituent (like the nitro groups) creates a chiral center on the central carbon? Wait, no, the central atom is a carbon in biphenyl, but it's connected to two phenyl groups and two other substituents. Wait, but in biphenyl, the central bond is a sigma bond, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl rings, a nitro group, and a carboxylate group. Wait, that's four substituents. Wait, no: the formula is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2, and the other ring has the same. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is attached to two phenyl groups (from each ring), a nitro group (from one ring's 6 position), and a carboxylate group (from the same ring's 2 position). Wait, no, each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions relative to the connecting point (which is 1). So the central carbon (the one where the two rings are connected) is attached to two phenyl groups (from each ring) and two substituents: a nitro (from one ring's 6) and a carboxylate (from the same ring's 2). Or do I have that wrong? Wait, maybe each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So the central carbon is attached to two rings, and each ring has two substituents. So each substituent is on the same ring as the central carbon. So the substituents on the same ring would be at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the central carbon (the connecting point) is attached to two phenyl rings, but each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So the central carbon isn't itself a chiral center because it's connected to two identical groups (the two phenyl rings). Wait, but each phenyl ring has two substituents. So the arrangement around the central bond could lead to axial chirality. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that the arrangement isn't symmetrical. So if on each ring, the nitro is in one position and the carboxylate in another, and the overall structure is not symmetrical, then the molecule would have axial chirality. But wait, the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. So each ring's substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). Are those positions across from each other? Because 2 and 6 are adjacent in a phenyl ring? Wait no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, etc. So 2 and 6 are across from each other, like para positions. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring with six positions, position 1 is attached, then 2 is next to 1, 3 is next to 2, 4 is opposite 1, 5 is next to 4, and 6 is next to 5, which is adjacent to 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, position 1 is connected to position 2 and 6. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. So 2 and 6 are adjacent. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to each other. So the substituents on each ring are next to each other. So, for each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are adjacent, so the nitro and carboxylate are next to each other on each ring. So how would that affect the overall structure? If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are next to each other, then the two substituents on each ring are adjacent. So the two rings would each have two substituents adjacent, but how would that influence the axial chirality of the biphenyl?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a center of asymmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged so that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure about this one. Let me move on and come back.

Next is compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's more like 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COO^-. Wait no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO^-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO^-? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, so its methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait: the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait no, wait. Let me think. Propanoate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-R. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is: the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to an OH group, a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, let me draw it:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but that's not correct. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-COO^- ? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH. So each carbon in the ester is:

The first carbon is the methyl group (OCH3), then the ester oxygen, then the carbonyl carbon, then two CH2 groups, and a hydroxyl on the second CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

It's the ester where the propanoate part is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, the propanoate is three carbons, so the structure would be:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is in the middle. Wait, let me get this right. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. So, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbons are:

1 (CH2-), 2 (CH(OH)-), 3 (COOCH3). So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. So the carbonyl is between the OCH3 and the CH2CH2OH.

So, the question is whether this molecule has any chiral centers. Looking at the structure, the central carbon in the ester is the COOCH3 group. But wait, the carbon next to the hydroxyl is the second carbon. Let me number the carbons:

1: COOCH3 (the carbonyl carbon is C1)
2: CH2 (next to C1)
3: CH2OH (next to C2)
So, the structure is CH2CH2OH-COOCH3, but wait, the carbonyl is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH. So the carbons are: the carbonyl carbon (C1) connected to OCH3 and two CH2 groups. The CH2 groups are at C2 and C3. The C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and each C2 and C3 have their own substituents.

Wait, but the actual structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2-CH2-OH group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The propanoate ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the chain is:

COOCH3 is the first group, then two CH2 groups, with the hydroxyl on the second CH2.

Wait, but wait, the ester group is -O-CO-OCH3. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents.

In this molecule, let's look at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. The carbon with the OH is the second carbon. So, what are the groups attached to it?

It is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2 from COOCH3)
- Another CH2 (the third carbon, which is attached to the hydroxyl and another CH2)
Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2OH

But wait, that's three carbons in the ester. So the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, so the two CH2 groups are between the carbonyl and the hydroxyl.

So the second carbon (the one between carbonyl and hydroxyl) is connected to:

- Carbonyl (O=C-OCH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one to the left, one to the right)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, in O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH, the middle CH2 is connected to the C=O, the next CH2, and two H's, right? So each CH2 has two H's. So the middle carbon has two CH2 groups and two H's. So it's CH2-CH2, meaning the middle carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, connected to C=O, another CH2, and two H's. So, in that case, carbon 2 is CH2, which can't be a chiral center because it's only attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups). Wait, but wait, carbon 2 is the central CH2. Let me think again: the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is connected to a CH2-CH2-OH group.

So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to OCH3, and two CH2 groups (C2 and C3). So C1 is connected to OCH3, C2, and two oxygens (from the carbonyl and ester).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

Looking at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (carbon 3), which is the CH2OH group. Carbon 3 is connected to:

- Carbon 2 (which is CH2)
- Two hydrogens
- The hydroxyl group (-OH)

So, substituents on carbon 3: CH2 group (from C2), two H's, and OH. So that's three substituents, but wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So carbon 3 is CH2OH, which is CH2- group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon, then a CH2 group (carbon 2), then another CH2 group (carbon 3) with the hydroxyl.

So carbon 3 is connected to:

- Carbon 2 (CH2)
- Two hydrogens
- OH group.

So, in this case, carbon 3 is CH2OH, so it's connected to CH2 (from C2), two H's, and OH. That's three substituents, but wait, each carbon has four bonds. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is:

The molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to OCH3, and two CH2 groups (C2 and C3). C2 is connected to C1, C3, and two H's. C3 is connected to C2, two H's, and an OH group.

So, for each carbon:

C1: COOCH3 (attached to OCH3, and two CH2 groups, and the carbonyl O). So it's a carbonyl carbon, double bonded to O, so no chiral center.

C2: CH2 connected to C1 and C3. So it's CH2, with two H's, so not a chiral center.

C3: CH2OH. So it's connected to C2 (CH2), two H's, and OH. That's four substituents. Wait, no, CH2OH is a group where the carbon is connected to two H's, one OH, and the rest is connected to C2 (CH2-). So substituents on C3 are:

- One CH2 (from C2)
- Two H's
- One OH.

Wait, that's three substituents, but each carbon must have four. So perhaps it's better to think that C3 is a CH2 group with an OH attached. So the substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4, but wait, I'm getting confused). Maybe I should write the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbonyl is at the end, connected to OCH3, and the other side is CH2CH2OH.

So the middle carbons are both CH2 groups. So the first CH2 is connected to the carbonyl, the next CH2 is connected to the hydroxyl.

So the second carbon (the first CH2 after the carbonyl) is CH2, connected to carbonyl, the next CH2, and two H's. So it can't be chiral.

The third carbon is the CH2OH group, connected to the second CH2, two H's, and an OH. So wait, substituents on the third carbon would be:

- CH2 (from the second carbon)
- Two H's
- OH.

So that's four substituents? Wait, no, because each CH2 group has two H's. So the third carbon is connected to:

- The second CH2 (which is connected to the carbonyl)
- Two H's
- OH.

So substituents are: CH2 (from C2), H, H, OH. So two substituents are H's, which are identical. Hence, the third carbon has three different groups (CH2, H, OH) and one more H. So four substituents, but two are the same. Therefore, the third carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Let me count again. The third carbon is attached to:

1. The second carbon (which is a CH2 group)
2. Two hydrogens
3. One hydroxyl group.

So substituents are: CH2-, H, H, OH. So four substituents, but two are H's. Therefore, the third carbon is not a chiral center because two substituents are the same.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Then why would it exhibit optical isomerism? Wait, I must be making a mistake here. Oh wait, wait. Maybe the structure is different.

Another possibility: Maybe the molecule is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. No, that's not correct. Because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the second carbon (next to carbonyl) have substituents: carbonyl, CH2, two H's. So for the second carbon:

- Connected to carbonyl (C=O)
- Two CH2 groups (one from the carbonyl side, one to the hydroxyl side)
- Or wait, no. The second carbon is CH2, connected to carbonyl, and to another CH2 which leads to the hydroxyl. So the substituents on the second carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) are:

- C=O group
- Two CH2 groups (one from carbonyl, one to the hydroxyl)
- Or wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the second CH2. So:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-OH.

So the carbonyl is at the end, and then two CH2 groups. So the second CH2 would be the one closer to the hydroxyl.

So for the second carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl's CH2), the substituents are:

- The first CH2 (connected to carbonyl)
- The third carbon (which is the hydroxyl-bearing CH2)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, so substituents are:

- CH2 (from C1)
- CH2 (from C3)
- Two H's.

So all four substituents are not different. Therefore, no chiral center.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it would be achiral. But if not, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, there wouldn't be a chiral center. If not, there could be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate ester is CH2-CH2-COOCH3, with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2(OH)-CH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2CH2OH.

So the carbonyl is at the end, and the two CH2 groups are in between. The second CH2 has the hydroxyl.

So the second CH2 is connected to:

- The first CH2 (from the carbonyl)
- The third CH2 (which has the hydroxyl)
- Two hydrogens.

So substituents on the second carbon (assuming it's the central CH2) would be:

- CH2 (from the carbonyl side)
- CH2 (from the hydroxyl side)
- Two H's.

Thus, the substituents are two CH2 groups and two H's. So it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but what about the third carbon? The third carbon is attached to:

- The second CH2
- OH
- Two H's.

So substituents: CH2 (from second carbon), H, H, OH.

Again, two H's, so not a chiral center.

Hmm, so if this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, then it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So maybe compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrically arranged, then it would be achiral. If not, it would be chiral.

In CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's see. If I draw the molecule, the carbonyl is on the left, two CH2 groups in the middle, then the hydroxyl on the right. So the structure is like:

O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - OH.

Is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine a mirror plane running through the middle. The left side is O=C-OCH3 and CH2, the right side is CH2 and OH. So the mirror image would swap the CH2 and OH groups. But since there's no OH on the left, it's not symmetrical. So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry and is chiral.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So in this case, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let me imagine: the COOCH3 is on one end, and the OH is on the other end. The two CH2 groups are in between. But the OH is only on one end. So it's asymmetrical.

Wait, but the two CH2 groups are identical. So, the left side has a COOCH3 and a CH2, and the right side has a CH2 and an OH. So, in terms of substituents on the central carbon (the second CH2), it's connected to two CH2 groups, two H's, and so on. But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, but I can't see it. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center I'm not seeing.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-O-C(O)-CH(OH)-CH3. No, that's not right because the formula would be different. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group, making that carbon a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3O)COCH2CH2OH. So the ester is O-CO-OCH3, connected to a CH2CH2OH group. The structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2OH.

In this case, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- The carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3)
- The third carbon (CH2OH)
- Two H's.

So substituents are O=C-OCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. So four substituents, but two are H's. So it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the third carbon is the one with the OH. So the third carbon is connected to:

- The second CH2
- OH
- Two H's.

So substituents are CH2 (from C2), OH, and two H's. Again, two substituents are H's, so not a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing the point. Let's think about whether any carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. In this case, does any carbon meet that condition?

Let me look at each carbon:

1. The carbonyl carbon (C=O): attached to two oxygens (from the ester) and two carbons (the two CH2 groups). So substituents are OCH3, O=C-OCH3, and two CH2 groups. No, wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's only attached to OCH3, the two CH2 groups, and the double-bonded O. So substituents are OCH3, and two CH2 groups. But since it's double-bonded, it's not a chiral center.

2. The first CH2 group (attached to the carbonyl): substituents are carbonyl, two H's, and the next CH2. So four groups, but two are H's. Not chiral.

3. The second CH2 group (attached to the hydroxyl): substituents are the previous CH2, two H's, and the hydroxyl. Again, two H's, so not chiral.

So none of the carbons are chiral centers. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I might be wrong here. Maybe I should think of another approach, like drawing the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is structured as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would have the structure:

COOCH3 is at the end, connected via two CH2 groups to the OH. So, the molecule is symmetrical if both CH2 groups are identical. But wait, the left side is COOCH3, and the right side is OH. So that's not symmetrical. Thus, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.

Wait, but if it's not symmetrical, then it should have a chiral center. But earlier analysis suggests that no carbon is a chiral center. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, maybe the ester group is attached in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is the CH2 group. So the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, attached to OCH3 and the CH2. So the carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center.

The only other carbons are the two CH2 groups. Let me think: the second CH2 is between the two CH2 groups. So, the substituents are:

- From the left: CH2 connected to carbonyl
- From the right: CH2 connected to OH
- Two H's.

So substituents are: CH2 (left), CH2 (right), H, H. So, substituents are two CH2 groups and two H's. So, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the two CH2 groups are actually different. If the substituents on the left and right are different, then perhaps the central CH2 is a chiral center.

In our case, the left side is connected to the carbonyl, the right side is connected to the hydroxyl. So, the substituents on either side are different (carbonyl vs hydroxyl). So, the central CH2 has substituents: carbonyl side (CH2 connected to COOCH3) and hydroxyl side (CH2 connected to OH). So the substituents are:

- One CH2 group leading to COOCH3
- One CH2 group leading to OH
- Two H's.

So, four substituents. Are any of them the same? The two CH2 groups are different because one leads to COOCH3 and the other to OH. So substituents are (COOCH3-CH2), (OH-CH2), H, H. So, two are H's, so the central CH2 has two H's, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is different. Maybe it's a cyclic structure, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a stereocenter elsewhere.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on to the next compound and see if I can figure out the others, then come back.

Compound 3: Benzophenone. That's (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so it's a diphenyl ketone. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, benzophenone has a central ketone group connected to two phenyl rings. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So, it's connected to two phenyl groups and the O. Since it's double-bonded, the carbonyl carbon can't be a chiral center because it's only connected to three groups (two phenyl, one O). So, no chiral centers here. Also, the molecule is symmetrical, as both substituents on the carbonyl are phenyl groups. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Compound 4: Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer, whereas maleate is the cis. The structure of fumarate is:

HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in trans configuration. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) on opposite sides (trans configuration). So, the structure is:

HO2C–CH2–CH2–COO^–? No, wait, no. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate is the diester, where the two methyl ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, actually, fumarate is the trans diastereomer, with the substituents on opposite sides. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
C=O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2-CH2 group, but that can't be right because fumaric acid has a double bond. Wait, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH in the trans configuration. So, the diester would have ester groups instead of the hydroxyls. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. That is, the substituents (the ester groups) are trans to each other across the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look. The double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to an ester group (OOCCH3) and a hydrogen.

So, for each CH in the double bond, the substituents are:

- For the first CH (left side): OOCCH3, H, and two bonds to the double bond.

- For the second CH (right side): OOCCH3, H, and two bonds to the double bond.

Wait, but each CH in the double bond would have substituents: OOCCH3, H, and two CH groups connected via the double bond. So, each CH is connected to two identical groups (the double bond), making them not chiral centers.

Wait, but wait. The double bond itself can lead to geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry, like axial chirality.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each CH group is connected to an ester group (OOCCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond. So, each CH has two identical substituents (the two double bonds), so they can't be chiral centers.

But wait, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). So, this molecule has a plane of symmetry. So it's not chiral.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it could be chiral.

Wait, another approach: dimethyl fumarate (the trans diester) is actually a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. It's (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to an OOCCH3 group. So, each CH is connected to OOCCH3, H, and the double bond. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides.

Now, looking for a plane of symmetry: imagine a plane bisecting the molecule along the double bond. Each side mirrors the other. So, the molecule is symmetrical, hence achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of another way. If I have two identical groups on either side of a double bond, arranged trans, the molecule could be meso. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Each CH in the double bond is connected to OOCCH3, H, and two double bonds. So, each CH has substituents: OOCCH3, H, and two double bonds. So, each CH has two identical substituents (the double bonds), so no chiral centers.

Wait, but if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either. Wait, but wait another moment. I thought fumarate is the trans isomer, which is achiral because it's a meso compound. But wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is chiral because it has a stereogenic center? No, wait. Let me think. Each double bond in fumarate is between two carbons, each connected to an -COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons is connected to two identical groups (the double bond). Therefore, those carbons are not chiral centers. So the molecule has no chiral centers.

But wait, is there any possibility of axial chirality in the molecule? For example, in allenes or in some cyclic structures. But in a trans double bond, there's no axial chirality. Axial chirality typically occurs in allenes (like in 1,2-dichloro-1,2-dichloroethene) or in certain bridged compounds. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, there's no axial chirality because the substituents are on the same side? Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the substituents are on opposite sides. So, for each CH, the substituents are OOCCH3, H, and the double bond. But again, no chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate has both ester groups on the same side and is a meso compound, hence achiral. Fumarate, on the other hand, is also a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, fumarate is not a meso compound. Wait, let me think: meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, in the case of maleic acid, the cis isomer has two chiral centers but is a meso compound because it's symmetrical. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, which is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry and has no internal symmetry, making it a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which has two chiral centers. The structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. Wait, no, that's not right. The structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH in the trans configuration, so the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each of the CH groups in the double bond is connected to a COOH group and a hydrogen. So, the two CH groups are each connected to a COOH, a hydrogen, and the double bond.

Now, each CH in the double bond would have substituents: COOH, H, and the double bond. So, each CH would be connected to two identical substituents (the double bond). So, neither of them is a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. If the two COOH groups are on opposite sides, then each CH has substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, but without chiral centers, how can the molecule be chiral? It can't, unless there's another form of chirality, like in allenes or certain other structures.

Ah, wait. The double bond in fumarate is between two carbons, each of which is connected to a COOH group. So, the structure is:

COOH
|
C = C
|
COOH

But in the trans configuration, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, but each C in the double bond is connected to a COOH group, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So, each C has substituents: COOH, H, and two bonds to the double bond. So, each C is connected to three substituents, making it a trigonal planar geometry. Therefore, those carbons are not chiral centers.

So, fumaric acid doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is a chiral molecule because it has a plane of symmetry? Or because it's not symmetrical?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing fumarate with some other compound. Let me look up whether fumarate exhibits optical activity. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I remember that fumarate is a meso compound. No, wait, that's maleate. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and it's a meso compound. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer and is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but earlier analysis suggests it doesn't have any chiral centers.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently. If a molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but is still chiral, it's called a chiral molecule without chiral centers. For example, allenes or certain compounds with axial chirality.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the diester of fumaric acid, the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 in the trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this structure have any chiral centers? Each CH in the double bond is connected to OOCCH3, H, and the double bond. So, each CH has substituents: OOCCH3, H, and two bonds to the double bond. So, the substituents are OOCCH3, H, and two identical groups (the double bond), making them not chiral centers.

But wait, the molecule as a whole could be chiral due to the arrangement around the double bond. This is called geometric isomerism, which is different from optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of chirality, which can come from chiral centers or other forms like axial chirality.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical. Because it has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me imagine looking at the molecule: the two ester groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, perhaps it's chiral.

But without any chiral centers, how can that be? Oh, because the molecule has a center of chirality elsewhere, perhaps due to the double bond's geometry. Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's due to the double bond's configuration leading to axial chirality.

Wait, in allenes, axial chirality arises from the arrangement around the double bonds. For example, in 1,2-dichloroethene, the substituents on either end of the double bond can create axial chirality. So, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the trans configuration creates axial chirality, making the molecule chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: for axial chirality, the molecule must have a biphenyl-like structure or a similar arrangement where the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of internal symmetry. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to axial chirality. Therefore, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. No, wait, no. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester, which would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are mirrored. But in reality, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.

So, this would mean that compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that there are no chiral centers. So, how can the molecule be chiral? Because of the trans configuration leading to axial chirality.

So, in conclusion, compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, going back to compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

In this compound, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2. So, substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent (since in a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is adjacent to 1 as well, making 2 and 6 adjacent? Wait, no, 1 is the point where the two rings are connected. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting point (position 1). So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, adjacent to the point of connection.

So, the arrangement on each ring is that the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, which are adjacent to the 1 position. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the arrangement around the central bond is asymmetrical, then the molecule would have axial chirality.

So, for example, if on each ring, the nitro group is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, and these substituents are arranged such that they are on the same side of the biphenyl, it could lead to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6) and their arrangement is such that the overall molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral. But if their arrangement is asymmetrical, then it's chiral.

So, in this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetric with respect to the central bond?

Yes. Because the two rings are connected at 1, and each has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to 1. So, the substituent positions on each ring are symmetrical with respect to the central bond. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but no. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions don't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral. For example, if on one ring, the nitro group is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, and on the other ring, the nitro is at 2 and the carboxylate at 6, that would create asymmetry. But in this case, both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, so their arrangement might be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that they are on the same side of the biphenyl, leading to a lack of symmetry. So, for example, if both nitro groups are on the same side (like both on the top of each ring), the molecule might be chiral.

Wait, let me think of the biphenyl as two rings connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, substituent positions on each ring are at 2 (adjacent to 1) and 6 (opposite to 1). So, the 2 position is next to 1, and 6 is across from 1. Wait, but in a benzene ring, position 6 is adjacent to 1 if you number them correctly. Wait, no, position 6 is across from 1. Because in a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to 1 but are across from each other relative to the ring.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, on each ring, substituents are at positions that are adjacent to each other. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other relative to the ring, but adjacent to the connecting point (1).

So, the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2. If both substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

But if they are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

So, in the given compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Are they arranged symmetrically, leading to a plane of symmetry?

Assuming that the substituents are in positions that create a symmetrical arrangement, the molecule might be achiral. But if they're arranged asymmetrically, it could be chiral.

Wait, but the question is about whether the compound can exhibit optical isomerism. So, if the molecule can have non-superimposable mirror images, it would show optical isomerism.

In the case of biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. So, the key is whether the substituents are arranged in a way that leads to axial chirality.

In the given compound, each ring has a nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has substituents in positions that are adjacent to the central bond (1) but across from each other on the same ring.

So, the substituents on each ring are in positions that are para to each other. So, on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, which are across from each other. So, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring are not mirrored, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, if on one ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate is at 2, and on the other ring, the nitro is at 2 and the carboxylate is at 6, then the arrangement would be asymmetrical, leading to axial chirality.

But in our case, both rings have their substituents at 2 and 6. So, the arrangement may be symmetrical, leading to no chirality.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions are not symmetrical, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but the given compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each ring has substituents at 6 and 2. So, the 6 positions on each ring have nitro groups, and the 2 positions have carboxylate groups. So, the arrangement on each ring is that the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, which are across from each other on each ring.

So, looking from the biphenyl's central bond, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, if we imagine looking along the central bond, the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back:

Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Earlier analysis is conflicting. Wait, let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Does this molecule have any chiral centers?

The hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. Let me number the carbons in the ester:

1: COOCH3
2: CH2
3: CH2OH

So, the second carbon is connected to carbonyl, two CH2 groups, and two H's? No, wait, the second carbon is connected to the first (COOCH3), the third (CH2OH), and two H's. So, substituents on C2: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So, substituents are two H's, so not a chiral center.

The third carbon (CH2OH) is connected to C2, two H's, and OH. So, substituents: C2, H, H, OH. Again, two H's, so no chiral center.

So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. But without any chiral centers, how can that be? It can't. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let me imagine the structure of CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical around the central CH2 group. Because the two CH2 groups are identical, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central carbon, making it achiral.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! I think I'm making a mistake here. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be hydroxypropanoate with the hydroxyl on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

So, the carbons are:

1: COOCH3
2: CH2
3: CH2OH

So, the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If I imagine a plane bisecting the molecule between C2 and C3, then on one side is COOCH3-CH2 and on the other is CH2-OH. These are not mirror images, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral.

Wait, but wait, each of the CH2 groups are identical. So, the molecule is symmetrical. No, because the substituents on either side of the central plane are different: one side has COOCH3, the other has OH.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me approach this differently. The molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. So, the chain is O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH, attached to OCH3.

So, the two CH2 groups are in between the carbonyl and the hydroxyl. The question is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

The central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- two H's
- CH2OH.

So substituents are COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So two substituents are H's, so no chiral center.

The third carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- CH2 (from the second carbon)
- OH
- two H's.

So substituents are CH2, OH, H, H. Again, two H's, so no chiral center.

But wait, the third carbon is CH2OH. So, the substituents are:

- two H's
- OH
- CH2 (from the second carbon).

So, substituents are H, H, OH, CH2. Two substituents are the same, so it's not a chiral center.

Therefore, the molecule lacks any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, what if the molecule has a plane of symmetry?

If I imagine a plane passing through the central carbon (the second CH2), then on one side is COOCH3 and on the other is CH2OH. Are these mirror images? No, because COOCH3 and CH2OH are different groups. So, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.

Wait, but without any chiral centers, can a molecule be chiral? Yes, through other forms like axial chirality. But in this case, the molecule is a straight chain with no such features. So, it can't be chiral.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this with the concept of internal planes of symmetry. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In the case of CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, is there a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine a plane cutting the molecule into two halves. If one half is a mirror image of the other, then it's symmetrical. But in this case, one side is COOCH3 and the other is OH. So, the two halves are not mirror images, meaning the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral. But without any chiral centers, how does that work?

Ah, I think I'm confusing the concepts here. A molecule can be chiral without any chiral centers, but that's typically in cases like allenes or certain cyclic structures. For straight-chain molecules, chirality usually arises from chiral centers.

So, in this case, since there are no chiral centers, the molecule can't be chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No optical isomerism (because symmetrical).

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: No optical isomerism (no chiral centers).

3. Benzophenone: No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Yes, optical isomerism (due to axial chirality, as it's a trans diester with no plane of symmetry).

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, which would mean it's achiral. But that's conflicting with the idea that fumarate is the trans isomer and is chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I need to correct myself. Fumarate is the trans isomer and is indeed a chiral molecule, whereas maleate is the cis isomer and is a meso compound (achiral).

Wait, no. Wait, maleate is the cis isomer and is a meso compound, hence achiral. Fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, hence chiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate would have optical isomerism because it's chiral.

So, to summarize:

Which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1. No.

2. No.

3. No.

4. Yes.

Wait, but earlier analysis said compound 2 doesn't, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are given as A to D.

The question asks which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

If only compound 4 does, but looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

But from my analysis, only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 4. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3, then that would have a chiral center. But that's not the structure. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. So, no chiral centers.

But perhaps another structure. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The structure is a straight chain with COOCH3, two CH2 groups, and OH on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as (CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-OH. So, the ester is on the first carbon, then two CH2 groups, then the OH.

In this case, the middle carbon (second CH2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 on one side
- CH2OH on the other
- Two H's.

So substituents are COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So, two substituents are H's, so not a chiral center.

The third carbon is CH2OH, connected to:

- CH2 group from the second carbon
- OH
- Two H's.

Again, substituents are CH2, OH, H, H. So, two H's, no chiral center.

Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 4. But looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

None of the options include only 4. So, either I made a mistake, or the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro), which are adjacent to the central bond (1).

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

But in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other on the ring. So, the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical fashion on each ring, leading to a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 4. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Are there any other compounds among the four that exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I missed something with compound 1. Let me think about the possibility of axial chirality.

In biphenyls, axial chirality arises when the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if on one ring, substituents are on the same side of the central bond, and on the other ring, they're on the opposite side, the molecule can be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Assuming that the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and exhibit axial chirality.

But wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other on each ring. So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, the molecule could be symmetrical.

But if the substituents on each ring are on the same side, then the molecule would be asymmetric, leading to axial chirality.

So, does the compound have substituents arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical or not?

In the given compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, if the nitro and carboxylate on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, the molecule would have axial chirality.

But without knowing the specific arrangement, I can't be certain. However, the question states that the substituents are in those positions, but it doesn't specify their arrangement relative to the central bond.

Assuming that the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, then compound 1 would exhibit axial chirality and hence optical isomerism.

Therefore, if both compound 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism, but the options don't have that combination, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

But, in the options, option A includes 1, 2, and 4. But I've determined that only 4 does, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Maybe it does have a chiral center. Let me reevaluate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but what if the structure is cyclopropane-based? No, that's not the case. It's a straight chain.

If the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3, then the central carbon would be CH(OH), with substituents: OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and another CH3. Wait, that would make the central carbon a chiral center because it's connected to four different groups: OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and CH3. Wait, no, two substituents are CH3, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, no, that structure would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate: the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

So, the carbon attached to the OH is connected to:

- OCOCH3 (from the ester)
- CH3
- OH
- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would have the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH(OH)CH3.

So, the carbon attached to the OH is the second carbon, connected to:

- OCOCH3
- CH3
- OH
- and another CH3?

Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think: the formula is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the ester is OCOCH3, connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So, the carbon attached to the OH is connected to:

- OCOCH3
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- and another CH3 (from the same carbon? No, wait, that can't be.)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester group is OCOCH3, connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(OH)CH3.

No, that's not correct. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the carbonyl is connected to OCH3, and the adjacent carbon (the second carbon) is connected to OH and CH3 groups.

So, the substituents on the second carbon are:

- OCOCH3 (from the ester)
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- and another CH3 (from the same carbon? No, that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds.)

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)CH3. No, that's not 2-hydroxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)CH3, making the second carbon a chiral center.

Wait, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

So, the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) is connected to:

- OCOCH3
- CH3
- OH
- and another CH3?

Wait, that can't be, because each carbon can only have four substituents. So, perhaps the structure is:

The second carbon is connected to OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and another CH3. No, that's four substituents, two of which are CH3. So, the substituents are OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and CH3. So, two substituents are the same (CH3), making it not a chiral center.

Wait, unless the substituents are arranged differently. For example, if the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-CH3, but that's not correct for 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)CH3. No, that's not 2-hydroxy.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me approach it differently.

If the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to OCOCH3, two CH3 groups, and OH. So substituents: OCOCH3, CH3, CH3, OH. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none include only 4. So, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4.

Wait, let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a chiral molecule. So, dimethyl fumarate would have two enantiomers and hence exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer should include compound 4.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → if 1 is not chiral, this is incorrect.

B) 3 and 4 → 3 is benzophenone, which isn't chiral. So incorrect.

C) 2 and 3 → both not chiral. Incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → both not chiral. Incorrect.

Hmm, none of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound 1. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer would be A) 1,2,4. But earlier analysis suggested that compound 2 doesn't exhibit isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Maybe it does have a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the central carbon is connected to OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and CH3. So, substituents are OCOCH3, CH3, CH3, OH. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

But what if the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Then, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to OCOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. No chiral center.

The third carbon (CH2OH) is connected to CH2, OH, and two H's. Again, no chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options include that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester, which is a chiral molecule. So, it should exhibit optical isomerism. So, the correct answer must include compound 4.

Looking at the options, only option A includes compound 4, but it also includes 1 and 2, which I don't think exhibit isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they are not symmetrical, the molecule would be chiral.

For example, if on one ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2, and on the other ring, the nitro is at 2 and the carboxylate at 6, then the arrangement around the central bond would be asymmetrical, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, but in this compound, each ring has substituents at 6 and 2. So, on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2. So, both rings have the same substituent arrangement. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no chirality.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that only compound 4 does. But since none of the options include that, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But I've determined that only 4 does, so perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3, then the central carbon is connected to OCOCH3, two CH3 groups, and OH. So, substituents: OCOCH3, CH3, CH3, OH. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

But wait, if the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)CH3, then the hydroxyl is on the third carbon. The third carbon is connected to:

- CH2 (from the second carbon)
- OH
- two CH3 groups.

So, substituents are CH2, OH, CH3, CH3. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH2CH3. No, that's not 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-CH3. Then, the central carbon (the one with CH(CH2OH)) would have substituents: OCOCH3, CH2OH, CH3, and another CH3. So, substituents are OCOCH3, CH2OH, CH3, CH3. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit isomerism.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is that only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering that I might have missed some cases for compounds 1 and 2.

But based on my analysis, the only correct option would be only compound 4, but that's not present. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Based on the options, the only option that includes compound 4 is option A and B.

Option B is 3 and 4. But 3 is benzophenone, which doesn't exhibit isomerism.

So, the only option that includes 4 is option A.

But I've determined that only 4 does. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, considering that I might have made a mistake with compounds 1 and 2.

But given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group, making that carbon a chiral center.

Wait, the structure would then be CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

In this case, the carbon attached to the OH is connected to:

- OCOCH3
- CH3
- OH
- and another CH3.

So substituents are OCOCH3, CH3, OH, and CH3. Two substituents are CH3, so no chiral center.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism. But since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: some compounds can have both constitutional isomerism and stereoisomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism.

In any case, based on the analysis, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 4, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is asymmetrical, it can exhibit axial chirality.

So, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A: 1,2,4.

But earlier analysis of compound 2 suggests it doesn't exhibit isomerism. So, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compounds 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises from either chiral centers or axial chirality.

---

### **Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. However, in this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetrically arranged, with the nitro and carboxylate groups at positions 6 and 2, respectively. This symmetry results in a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, **compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. The molecule is a straight-chain ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the propanoate chain. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is connected to:

- The carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- Two hydrogen atoms,
- The third carbon (CH2OH).

Since two substituents are identical (the two hydrogens), the second carbon is not a chiral center. Similarly, the third carbon (CH2OH) is also not a chiral center because it has two identical hydrogen atoms. Additionally, the molecule lacks any form of axial chirality. Therefore, **compound 2 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 3: Benzophenone**

Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and connected to two identical phenyl groups. Double-bonded carbons cannot be chiral centers because they are sp² hybridized and have only three substituents. Furthermore, the molecule is symmetrical, with identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group. Thus, **compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. In the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. This arrangement disrupts the molecule's symmetry, leading to axial chirality. As a result, dimethyl fumarate exists as two non-superimposable enantiomers and exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, **compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (symmetrical biphenyl structure).
- **Compound 2**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (no chiral centers).
- **Compound 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (symmetrical structure).
- **Compound 4**: Exhibits optical isomerism (axial chirality due to the trans configuration).

From the given options, **only compound 4 exhibits optical isomerism**. However, none of the options explicitly include only compound 4. Based on the analysis, **option A (1, 2, and 4)** is the closest match, assuming a potential error in the question or options.
