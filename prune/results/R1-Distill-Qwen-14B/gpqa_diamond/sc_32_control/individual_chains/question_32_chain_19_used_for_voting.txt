Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we have to use the equations from special relativity. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast. So I think I'll need to calculate the Lorentz factor gamma because that comes into play with relativistic energies.

Wait, what's the Lorentz factor gamma? Oh right, gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. Let me compute that.

(0.96)^2 is 0.9216, so 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5=0.98, wait no, 3.5714 times 0.28 is around 1, yeah because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of nucleus X to calculate the total energy. Since X is Li with 3 neutrons, what's the isotope? Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. That makes it Li-6. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is needed.

I think the atomic mass can be found using the periodic table. But wait, I don't have exact numbers here. Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Let me think, for a more precise approach, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I can approximate. Each proton is about 938 MeV, same for each neutron. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. So the mass should be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 938 is 5,628 MeV. Oh, but wait, that's the rest mass energy, right? Because E = mc², so the rest mass energy is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

But wait, the actual atomic mass might be a bit different because of binding energy. Wait no, because when you calculate the rest mass, you have to consider the mass defect. Oh wait, no. Because when you combine protons and neutrons into a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy. So the rest mass of the nucleus is actually the sum of the masses minus the binding energy (divided by c²). But wait, if I calculate the rest mass energy as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, that's an overestimation. Because in reality, the nucleus has a lower mass due to the mass defect, which is the energy released when the nucleus forms.

But wait, when using the mass of the nucleus in relativistic calculations, I think the correct approach is to find the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which includes the mass defect. So maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, but given that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, perhaps the approximations are okay. Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think: If I use the mass of the nucleus as 6 times the mass of a proton (since neutron is slightly heavier but maybe they approximate to same mass), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the mass of Li-6 in terms of its atomic mass and then convert that into energy.

Wait, let me find the atomic mass of Li-6. I remember that the atomic mass of lithium is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, no, that's the average atomic mass for Li, considering its natural abundance (with isotopes Li-6 and Li-7). Oh, but Li-6 itself has a mass of around 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Wait, 1 atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So if Li-6 is 6.015 u, then its mass energy is 6.015 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

6.015 * 931.5 = let me compute 6*931.5 = 5589, 0.015 *931.5=13.9725. So total is 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV. Which is 5.6029725 GeV.

Wait, was that right? Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me check: from my vague memory, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. So, proceeding with that, the energy would be 6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.015 multiplied by 931.5. Let me compute that step by step.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015 * 931.5 = approximately 13.9725.

So adding them together: 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest energy of the nucleus, right? So the rest mass energy E0 is 5.603 GeV.

But wait, the problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus when moving at v=0.96c. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy.

So E = gamma * E0.

Earlier, I found gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6029725.

Hmm, 3 *5.603 is 16.809, 0.5714 *5.603 is about 3.198.

So 16.809 +3.198= ~19.007 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 19 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419, and option B is 23.069. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe the atomic mass of Li-6 is a bit different. Let me double-check that. I think I might have been a bit off. For example, if Li-6 is 6.015 u, then E0 is 5.60297 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the actual value is 6.014 u. Let me recalculate. If it's 6.014 u:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV, 0.014 *931.5=13.041 MeV. So total E0 is 5602.041 MeV → 5.602041 GeV.

Hmm, that's close to what I had before.

So gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.602041 ≈ ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

5.602041 *3.5714.

Let me break this down:

5.602041 *3 = 16.806123.

5.602041 *0.5 = 2.8010205.

5.602041 *0.0714 ≈ Let's compute 0.07 *5.602041=0.39214287, and 0.0014 *5.602041=0.007842857. So total is 0.39214287 +0.007842857=0.400 approx.

Adding them: 16.806123 +2.8010205 =19.6071435 +0.400=20.0071435 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.007 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is about 21.419. So 20.007 is closest to option C.

Wait, but perhaps I approximated gamma as 3.5714. Maybe a more precise value of gamma would affect the result.

Wait, let's compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c → v²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714286 *5.602041 GeV.

So 3.5714286 * 5.602041 = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.602041 =16.806123.

0.5714286 *5.602041.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.602041=2.8010205.

0.0714286 *5.602041 ≈ Let's compute 5.602041 *0.07 =0.39214287.

5.602041 *0.0014286 ≈ approximately 0.008 (since 5.6 *0.0014 is around 0.00784).

So 0.39214287 +0.008 =0.40014287.

So 0.5714286 *5.602041 =2.8010205 +0.40014287=3.20116337.

So total energy is 16.806123 +3.20116337 =19.991286 GeV.

Wait, so about 19.991 GeV. Hmm, that's approximately 20 GeV. The options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

So 19.991 is very close to 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Maybe the actual mass is higher. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. Let me recalculate the rest energy with that.

So 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 MeV.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005122 *931.5 = let's compute 0.005 *931.5=4.6575 and 0.000122 *931.5= about 0.1134.

So 4.6575 +0.1134 =4.7709.

So 9.315 +4.7709 =14.0859 MeV.

Total E0 is 5589 +14.0859 =5603.0859 MeV → 5.6030859 GeV.

So E0 is approximately 5.6030859 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.5714286):

5.6030859 *3.5714286.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6030859 =16.8092577.

0.5714286 *5.6030859:

0.5 *5.6030859 =2.80154295.

0.0714286 *5.6030859 ≈ Let's compute 5.6030859 *0.07 =0.392216, and 5.6030859 *0.0014286≈0.008 (as before).

So 0.392216 +0.008=0.400216.

So 0.5714286 *5.6030859 =2.80154295 +0.400216=3.20175895.

Adding to the 3* part: 16.8092577 +3.20175895 =20.0110166 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV. But in the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, so why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or the mass. Let me double-check the mass.

Wait, I think the mass of Li-6 is actually 6.015122 u, which is correct. So 6.015122 *931.5 MeV = as above, 5.6030859 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the mass of the lithium nucleus to be calculated using the number of nucleons, each with their rest mass, without considering the binding energy. Wait, but that would overstate the mass, leading to a higher energy.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is considering the mass as the sum of individual protons and neutrons. Let me think, for example, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's compute the total mass as 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = ?

3*(938.272) =2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565)=2818.695 MeV.

Total is 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV →5.633511 GeV.

Wait, so that's the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons. But the actual nucleus has a lower mass due to binding energy. So using this sum would give a higher E0, leading to a higher total energy. Let me see what that gives.

So E0 =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714286.

So E =5.633511 *3.5714286.

Calculating:

5 *3.5714286=17.857143.

0.633511 *3.5714286.

Hmm, 0.6*3.5714286=2.142857.

0.033511 *3.5714286 ≈ 0.1195.

So total ≈2.142857 +0.1195=2.262357.

So E =17.857143 +2.262357=20.1195 GeV.

Ah, that's approximately 20.1195 GeV. Which is very close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without considering the mass defect), leading to E0=5.6335 GeV and E=20.1195 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.12 GeV, matching option C.

But wait, why would the problem expect that approach? I thought that the actual rest mass of the nucleus is lower due to binding energy. But perhaps in this context, the problem is treating the nucleus as if it's a composite of individual nucleons, each contributing their rest mass, leading to a higher E0.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is treated as the sum of the protons and neutrons, neglecting binding energy for the sake of the problem.

In that case, the E0 would be approximately 5.6335 GeV. So gamma is 3.5714286, so E=5.6335*3.5714286≈20.12 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the problem is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no, the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy, not just the kinetic.

Wait, but let me clarify. The total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So RHIC's energy refers to the total energy.

So, if the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, the total energy is gamma*m*c². So the calculation I did earlier with the actual rest mass (including mass defect) gives around 20 GeV, but if the problem treats the mass as the sum of nucleons, it's about 20.12 GeV, which matches option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Using v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly.

So gamma =1/0.28 =3.5714285714...

So 3.5714285714.

Now, with E0 as 5.633511 GeV.

3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5714285714.

Hmm, 0.5714285714 is 4/7 approximately.

So 5.633511 *4/7 = ?

5.633511 *4=22.534044.

22.534044 /7 =3.21914914.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to this but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I used an approximate value for the mass of the nucleons. Let me check the exact mass values:

Proton mass: approximately 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: approximately 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So E0 =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E =5.633511 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this more precisely.

Multiplying 5.633511 by 3.5714285714.

Perhaps using a calculator approach:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5714285714.

Compute 5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.0714285714.

Let me compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.0014285714 ≈ approximately 5.633511 *0.0014=0.007886915.

So 0.39434577 +0.007886915≈0.402232685.

So 5.633511 *0.0714285714≈0.402232685.

So the 0.5714285714 contribution is 2.8167555 +0.402232685≈3.218988185.

So total E=16.900533 +3.218988185≈20.119521 GeV.

So approximately 20.1195 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of nucleons. Wait, the problem says X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual binding energy of Li-6. The binding energy can't be ignored because it affects the rest mass. So the actual mass is lower than the sum of individual nucleons. Let me think, but I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the molar mass for the atomic mass. Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u. So, perhaps I should stick with that value, leading to E0=5.603 GeV, which gives a total energy of about 20.01 GeV. But this doesn't match any option exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the gamma calculation. Let me double-check that.

Wait, another approach: calculate the kinetic energy (K) and then add it to the rest energy to get the total energy.

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

But the problem is asking for the total energy, which is gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma and the mass.

Let me try another approach. Let me calculate gamma more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) with v=0.96c.

v =0.96c → v²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Now, using the sum of the nucleon masses, E0=5.633511 GeV.

So gamma * E0 =3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Calculating:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this as:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈ let's compute precisely.

5.633511 *0.07142857 = ?

5.633511 * (7/99) approximately. Wait, 7/99 is about 0.0707, but 0.07142857 is 1/14.

Hmm, so 5.633511 * (1/14) = 5.633511 /14.

14 *0.4=5.6. So 5.633511 /14 = 0.40239364.

So 0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.40239364.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 =2.8167555 +0.40239364=3.21914914.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511 =16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps there's a slight discrepancy due to rounding. Maybe the precise calculation would give 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses more precise values for the mass.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is calculated as the mass of the atom, including electrons. Wait, but in high-energy physics, when considering nuclei, we usually take the rest mass of the nucleus, which is the sum of protons, neutrons, and the binding energy (which is subtracted). Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are considered, but in this case, since it's a nucleus, not an atom, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus.

Wait, but if we include the electrons, for a Li-6 nucleus, the atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons would add 1.533 MeV, which is negligible compared to the GeV scale. So that shouldn't affect the result significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the atomic mass, including electrons, but that would still be a minor adjustment.

Another thought: perhaps I should use more precise values for the speed and thus a more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Wait, v =0.96c, so v²/c² =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

So no error there.

So if the calculation gives me approximately 20.11968 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.012 GeV higher. Maybe the problem uses more precise values for the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151222 u, which when multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives:

6.0151222 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.0051222 *931.5= let's compute:

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0001222 *931.5= approximately 0.1136.

So total 4.6575 +0.1136=4.7711 MeV.

So 0.0151222 *931.5=9.315 +4.7711=14.0861 MeV.

So E0=5589 +14.0861=5603.0861 MeV =5.6030861 GeV.

Then, gamma * E0=3.5714285714 *5.6030861.

Let me compute this:

3 *5.6030861=16.8092583.

0.5714285714 *5.6030861.

0.5 *5.6030861=2.80154305.

0.0714285714 *5.6030861≈ let me compute:

5.6030861 *0.07 =0.392216.

5.6030861 *0.0014285714≈ 0.008.

So total 0.392216 +0.008=0.400216.

So 0.5714285714 *5.6030861=2.80154305 +0.400216≈3.20175905.

Total energy E=16.8092583 +3.20175905=20.011017 GeV.

Which is about 20.011 GeV. So why is option C 20.132 GeV?

Hmm, perhaps the approach is different. Maybe the problem uses the relativistic energy for each nucleon, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the kinetic energy instead of the total energy, but the question asks for the total energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction, but I'm using 0.96c correctly. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should use another formula for gamma: gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But that's what I did. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the rest energy in terms of nucleons, not the nucleus as a whole. Wait, no, the question is about the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but no, the options are in GeV, which is a large unit, more appropriate for the entire nucleus.

Another angle: perhaps the problem isn't about the rest energy but the kinetic energy. Let me check.

If the question were about kinetic energy, K= (gamma-1)*m*c².

So, with E0=5.603 GeV, gamma=3.5714.

K=(3.5714-1)*5.603 =2.5714*5.603≈ 14.400 GeV.

But the options are higher than that, so the question must be about total energy.

Wait, but the options include 20.132, which is close to the 20.1197 I calculated earlier when using the sum of nucleon masses. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of nucleon masses, leading to option C.

But in reality, the nucleus has a lower mass than the sum, so using the sum would give a higher energy than the actual. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass, leading to around 20 GeV, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest energy. Let me try with more precise figures.

Exact mass of Li-6: 6.0151222 u.

E0=6.0151222 *931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0151222 *931.5: Let me compute this more precisely.

0.0151222 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0001222 *931.5=0.1136.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725, plus 0.1136=14.0861 MeV.

So E0=5589 +14.0861=5603.0861 MeV =5.6030861 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma=3.5714285714.

5.6030861 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this with more precision.

Breaking it down:

5.6030861 *3 =16.8092583.

5.6030861 *0.5714285714.

Compute 5.6030861 *0.5=2.80154305.

5.6030861 *0.0714285714.

Compute 5.6030861 *0.07 =0.392216027.

5.6030861 *0.0014285714 = approximately 0.008.

Adding 0.392216027 +0.008=0.400216027.

So 0.5714285714 *5.6030861=2.80154305 +0.400216027=3.201759077.

So total E=16.8092583 +3.201759077=20.011017377 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic mass formula, where mass increases with speed. But no, the rest mass is still the same, and the total energy is gamma times rest energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction of c in terms of beta, but perhaps I should recompute gamma with beta=0.96.

Wait, beta is v/c =0.96 → beta^2=0.9216.

So gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed, like 0.9996c, but no, the question says 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the options, but I can't do anything about that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy, but I don't think so because the options are higher than what I calculated for kinetic energy.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the nucleus is composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but considering that the binding energy is significant, perhaps the actual rest mass is lower than the sum, but without exact data, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula for each nucleon. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire nucleus is moving, not individual nucleons.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But looking at the options, option C is the closest to the 20.12 GeV I got when using the sum of the individual nucleon masses. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

So the answer would be option C, 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li with 3 neutrons, i.e., Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( E_0 \) of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.015122 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
E_0 = 6.015122 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 6 \times 931.5 = 5589 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( 0.015122 \times 931.5 \approx 14.0861 \, \text{MeV} \)

Adding these gives:

\[
E_0 = 5589 + 14.0861 = 5603.0861 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6030861 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma E_0 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6030861
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 3 \times 5.6030861 = 16.8092583 \)
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.6030861 \approx 3.201759077 \)

Adding these gives:

\[
E = 16.8092583 + 3.201759077 \approx 20.011017 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). However, option \( C \) is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), which is slightly higher. This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or the problem's assumptions about the nucleus's rest mass.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated value is \( C \), \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
