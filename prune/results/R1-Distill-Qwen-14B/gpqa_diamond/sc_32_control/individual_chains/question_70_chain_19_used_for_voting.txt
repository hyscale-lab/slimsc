Okay, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the reactions described. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio. Maybe a common reaction where a solid and a gas form a compound. Bright red makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide or maybe a metal oxide? But wait, when you form a compound with multiple equivalents, perhaps it's a complex with multiple B molecules.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas? Alternatively, considering other possibilities, perhaps something with high symmetry.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. One is strong, the other weak. Strong acid examples are HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or HCN. So when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. So C is probably a salt, maybe a sulfide or a nitride?

Wait, when you have a salt reacting with water to form acids, like if C is a sulfide, it might produce H2S (which is a weak acid) or if it's a nitride, NH3 and HNO3? Wait, but F is strong and G is weak. Hmm.

Another angle: C reacts with D to form E. Let's think about possible reactions. Maybe C is a metal oxide. Suppose B is something like O2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, B could be H2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, ether, etc. So D and B make a solvent. Let me think: if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O, a solvent. Or if B is O2 and D is H2, same thing. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else, but not sure.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2, giving H2O as the solvent.

If that's the case, let's think about the first reaction. A reacts with B (O2) in 8 equivalents. So maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2. Let's say A is copper metal. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would form CuO, but copper has multiple oxidation states. Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe A is a polyvalent metal. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is O2, forming Fe3O4, which has a formula with 4 O2 per Fe3. Hmm, but that's 4/3 equivalents per Fe, not 8. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a metal carbonyl. For example, Ni(CO)4. In that case, B would be CO. So A is Ni metal, and 4 CO molecules per Ni. But the question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps 2 Ni per CO? No, wait, perhaps it's a different stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na) and B is Cl2. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2. But in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B are used. So maybe 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That would suggest something like a compound with 4 Cl per A ion, maybe. For example, if A is Mg, 2 Mg + Cl2 → 2 MgCl. But MgCl is not stable; Mg typically forms MgCl2. So 1 Mg per 1 Cl2, which is 2 Cl per Mg. So that's 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Mg. But the first reaction uses 8 equivalents, so perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a complex with B. For instance, perhaps B is H2, and A is a transition metal that forms a hydride. But 8 equivalents would mean the metal takes 8 H2 molecules. That doesn't ring a bell immediately.

Wait, another possibility: the first reaction produces a compound that's red. What compounds are bright red? Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe some other oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide, like CuS is black. Hmm. Maybe it's a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Then, when C reacts with water, it would produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, which would then acidify to form a metal salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. If D is a halogen, like Cl2, and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form a dangerous substance. For example, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is Cl2, leading to SO2 or HCl. But that's not matching the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, reacting with D (like O2) could form a nitride oxide? Not sure.

Wait, let's consider that when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So, for example, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is not very stable) and H2S. But that only gives one acid, H2S. So perhaps C is a more complex salt.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it might not produce much except perhaps the carbonate dissociating into CO3^2- and the metal ion. But that doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, no, that's not likely to produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if C is a salt that's a combination of a metal and some anions that, when water is added, break down into the metal (A), and two acids. For example, maybe C is a sulfide of a group 1 metal? No, group 1 metals typically form +1 ions. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal that can form different oxidation states.

Wait, but let me try another approach. Let's consider the possible symmetry groups of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

D∞h is the symmetry group for something like a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. For example, CO2 is D∞h. But wait, CO2 is linear but has a center of inversion. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but the options include D4h, which is a higher symmetry than D2h. D4h has a four-fold axis of rotation, horizontal mirror planes, and inversion. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about product E. It's formed from C and 2 equivalents of D. So perhaps E is a molecule with a certain symmetry.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule with a linear structure. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. Or maybe something like SF6, which has Oh symmetry (but that's not one of the options).

Wait, D∞h symmetry is common for diatomic molecules like O2, H2, etc. So if E is O2, but wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule, but in what form? Ozone is O3, which has C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E could be something like SO2, which has a bent structure, which would have a C2v symmetry. Alternatively, SO3 would have D3h symmetry, but that's not an option here.

Wait, what about Cl2? Cl2 is a diatomic molecule and has D∞h symmetry. But that's if E is Cl2, but Cl2 is a gas, and in the reaction, D is a reagent. Wait, perhaps D is Cl2, and E is something else.

Wait, let's think again about the reactions.

1. A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s, bright red)
2. C(s) + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B(g) + D(g) → H(l), which is a solvent.

So H is a solvent formed by B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think about possible B and D combinations that make a solvent.

If B is H2 and D is O2, their reaction doesn't directly make a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, perhaps in a redox reaction, but that forms H2O, which is a solvent. So H is H2O.

So B is O2 and D is H2. Then, their reaction (B + D → H) is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So H is water, which is a solvent.

So B is O2, D is H2.

Now, let's go back to the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). What solid A reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form a bright red solid?

Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A. That's a lot. Let's think about metal oxidation states. Suppose A is iron. Iron oxide can be FeO (wustite), Fe3O4 (magnetite), or Fe2O3 (hematite). But their O:Fe ratios are 1:1, 4:3, 3:2 respectively. So 8 O2 per A would be a ratio of O2 to A as 8:1, but perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, manganese in +7 oxidation state (like in Mn2O7), which is dark brown, though. Or vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), which is orange.

Wait, but bright red. Maybe it's a sulfide? No, because sulfides are usually black or another color.

Wait, another possibility: A is copper (Cu). When copper reacts with oxygen, it forms CuO (black) or Cu2O (which is a reddish solid). Oh! Cu2O is bright red. So if A is copper, and B is O2, then 4 Cu + O2 → 2 Cu2O. Wait, the stoichiometry here is 1 mole of O2 per 4 moles of Cu. So 8 equivalents would be 2 moles of O2 per 4 moles of Cu, which is 0.5 equivalents per mole of Cu. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B (O2) per mole of A. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. So, the stoichiometry is A + 8 O2 → C.

Let me think of a reaction where a solid metal reacts with O2 to form an oxide with a 1:8 ratio. That seems unusual. Maybe A is a metal with a very high oxidation state.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide, Na2O2. Sodium (A) reacts with O2 to form Na2O2. The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. But that's 1 mole O2 per 2 moles Na, so 1 equivalent. But the question says 8 equivalents, so perhaps the oxide is more complex.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with oxygen to form Al2O3. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So for 4 Al, 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So per Al, O2 is 3/4. That's 0.75 equivalents per mole Al. Not 8.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I'm approaching the first reaction incorrectly. Let's think about what could form a bright red solid when reacting with O2.

Wait, maybe C is a manganese compound. Mn2O7 is a dark brown solid. Not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but their oxides are usually green or brown.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is not an oxide. Could it be a sulfide? But sulfides are usually not red. However, PbS is a dark brown solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about transition metal carbonyls. For example, Ni(CO)4 is a liquid or solid, but not red. Maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Let's think about the formation of C from A and 8 equivalents of B (O2). Suppose A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal like Fe, and C is FeO4^2- or something. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a complex oxide. Like a metal with multiple oxygen atoms. But I'm not recalling a bright red oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a different kind of compound, like a metal azide? Unlikely, but not sure about the color.

Alternatively, maybe the product C is a metal oxide with a different structure. Wait, copper(II) oxide is black, but copper(I) oxide is red. Oh! So Cu2O is a bright red solid. So if A is copper metal, and B is O2, then the reaction could be:

2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO → but that's black.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is under different conditions. Alternatively, is there a way to form Cu2O?

Cu2O can be formed by the reaction of copper with sulfur in a particular way, but in this case, the reactant is O2. So, maybe when copper is heated in O2, it forms CuO, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can form Cu2O. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

4 Cu + O2 → 2 Cu2O. Let's check the stoichiometry. 4 moles of Cu, 1 mole O2 → 2 moles Cu2O.

So for 4 moles Cu, 1 mole O2. So per mole of Cu, 0.25 moles O2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, which is O2, per mole of A (Cu). So 8 moles O2 per mole of Cu. That doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track with B being O2. Let me think differently.

If H is the solvent formed by D and B in a 1:1 ratio, and H is a solvent like water, then D and B are H2 and O2. So, back to that conclusion.

So B is O2, D is H2.

Now, the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red).

Looking for a reaction where a solid metal reacts with 8 moles of O2 per mole of A to form a bright red solid.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A is a metal that forms a superoxide. For example, K (potassium) forms KO2 (super oxide). The reaction is 2 K + O2 → 2 KO2. So each K uses 1 O2, so for 2 K, 1 O2. So per mole of K, 0.5 O2. Not 8.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. Let's see, perhaps V in +5 oxidation state.

Wait, Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is orange, not red.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is tin, Sn. Sn can form SnO2 (stannic oxide, white) and SnO (stannous oxide, which is yellowish). Not red.

Alternatively, maybe A is silver, which forms AgO, but AgO is not a common oxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide or another compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an oxide. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe C is a nitride? If A is a metal that forms a nitride, perhaps with O2 as the reactant. Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule; if it's a nitride, the reaction would involve N2, not O2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe B is not O2. Let me try a different approach.

If B is H2, then what? Then D would be something else. Because in the fourth reaction, B + D → H (solvent). If B is H2, then D would need to form a solvent with H2. For example, D could be O2, and H2O is the solvent. So H is H2O.

Wait, but earlier I thought B is O2. Let's reevaluate. Let me try B as H2.

So in the first reaction, A (solid) reacts with 8 eq H2 → C (bright red).

What solid reacts with H2 in large amounts? Maybe a transition metal that forms a hydride. For example, Ti reacts with H2 to form TiH2. But TiH2 is white, I think.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction producing a metal carbonyl. For example, Fe + CO → Fe(CO)5. But that's with CO, not H2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with H2. For example, sodium hydride (NaH) is a compound, but that's made from Na and H2. The reaction is 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. So 1 mole H2 per 2 moles Na. So for A as Na, 1 eq H2. But the first reaction uses 8 eq H2, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a different hydride. For example, magnesium hydride (MgH2). The reaction is Mg + H2 → MgH2. So 1 mole H2 per mole Mg. But the first reaction uses 8 eq H2 per mole A. So 8 moles H2 per mole A.

Hmm, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a complex with H2. For example, perhaps a transition metal hydride with a higher H:metal ratio. But I'm not aware of such a reaction with 8 H2 per metal atom.

Another thought: perhaps C is a different kind of compound. Let's think about when a solid reacts with multiple H2 molecules to form a compound. For example, perhaps it's a reduction reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonyl. Let's say A is Fe, and B is CO. Then, Fe + CO → Fe(CO)5. The stoichiometry would be Fe + 5 CO → Fe(CO)5. That's 5 eq CO per mole Fe. But the first reaction uses 8 eq, so that's close. So maybe C is Fe(CO)5. Bright red? I think Fe(CO)5 is a yellow liquid, not red.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps C is a different compound. Let's think of something else.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If A is a metal that reacts with H2S to form a sulfide. But in this case, B is H2, not H2S. So that may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2. Then, D would be something that reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is something else, but I don't see a direct reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, the solvent H is H2O.

Now, back to the first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So C is a bright red solid formed from A and O2.

Wait, maybe C is a molybdenum compound. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a brown solid, but I'm not sure about its color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium trioxide (CrO3) is dark red. Oh! That's possible. So CrO3 is a bright red solid.

So, if A is Cr metal, then Cr reacts with O2 to form CrO3. The reaction would be:

4 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 CrO3.

Wait, that's 3 moles O2 for 4 Cr → 2 CrO3. So per mole Cr, (3/4) moles O2. Which is 0.75 eq. But the first reaction uses 8 eq O2 per mole A. So 8 moles O2 per mole Cr. That's much higher. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a metal oxide with a high oxygen content. Like PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide) is dark brown, but not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is a metal that forms a nitride upon reaction with N2, but since B is O2, that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So when C is treated with water, it gives back A, and two acids. One strong (like HCl) and another weak (like CH3COOH).

So perhaps C is a salt that contains both Cl- and another anion that hydrolyzes to form a weak acid. Or maybe C is a salt that decomposes in water into a metal and two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite. When a sulfite reacts with water, it might decompose. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. But carbonates usually decompose into CO2 and the metal hydroxide. Which wouldn't produce two acids.

Wait, if C is a bisulfide salt, like a metal bisulfide, which upon reaction with water could produce H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But the metal hydroxide would then react with water (if it's a group 1 metal) or perhaps decompose. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: C could be a mixed salt. For example, a salt that contains both ClO3^- and Cl^- ions. When it decomposes, it might release HClO3 (a strong acid) and HCl (a strong acid as well, but perhaps in this case, one is stronger than the other? Wait, no, both are strong. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate and another salt. For example, perhaps a nitrate that, when decomposed, produces HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid.

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. Suppose C is a nitrate of a group 2 metal. Then, when it reacts with water, it would form the hydroxide (which is a weak base) and nitric acid (a strong acid). But that would give F as HNO3 and G as the hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, suppose C is a metal sulfite, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO3 (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide (a base). But again, that doesn't fit because one is an acid and the other is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that doesn't produce two acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think differently. Maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal. When it reacts with water, it can produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But the metal hydroxide is a base, so that doesn't directly produce two acids. Unless the metal hydroxide is amphoteric and reacts further with water to form an acid. For example, Al(OH)3 is amphoteric and can react with water to form Al(OH)3·nH2O, but I'm not sure if that produces an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (which is a weak acid? No, C2H2 is a neutral molecule, I think).

Hmm. I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should move on to the other reactions and see if that helps.

The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D (which is H2) to form E, an extremely hazardous product.

Wait, D is H2, so C + 2 H2 → E.

E is extremely hazardous. So what reacts with H2 to form something dangerous?

Maybe E is a highly toxic gas. For example, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is toxic, but that would require CN- in C. Alternatively, phosgene (COCl2) is highly toxic, but I'm not sure if that's formed from H2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent, but I'm not familiar with their synthesis from H2.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) is a liquid and is toxic. But how is it formed? Maybe from a metal oxide reacting with H2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a hydride. For example, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but I don't think it's extremely hazardous unless inhaled or ingested in large quantities. Not sure.

Wait, but the reaction is C + 2 H2 → E. So perhaps E is a compound with H2 acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with H2 would produce the metal and water. But that would produce H2O, not E. So perhaps C isn't an oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Reacting with H2 could form an amide and release NH3, but that's not matching.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, then H2 might not react directly. Unless under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal hydride. For example, NaH is formed from Na and H2. But in that case, C would have to be Na, which doesn't fit because C is a product of A and O2.

Alternatively, maybe E is a different compound altogether. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: what extremely hazardous products are formed from reactions involving H2? Maybe something like sarin gas, but I don't know the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide. For example, if C contains CN- groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly explosive compound, like H2O2 (but that's formed from H2 and O2, not C and H2).

Wait, another angle: Since D is H2, and C is reacting with 2 H2, perhaps E is a compound with H in a certain oxidation state. For example, if C is a metal oxide, then H2 could reduce it to the metal, but that would produce H2O, not E.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl, as I thought before. For example, if C is a metal oxide, and H2 acts as a reducing agent to form the metal, but then how would E be formed?

Hmm, I'm not making progress on this part. Let me think about the molecular symmetry group of E.

The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2, H2, or Cl2, then D∞h is the symmetry group. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry. SF6 has Oh symmetry, which isn't an option here.

Wait, if E is O2, then D∞h is the correct symmetry. O2 is a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion and two-fold axes perpendicular to the bond axis. So yes, D∞h symmetry.

But earlier, I thought E is formed from C and D (H2) in a 2:1 ratio. If E is O2, that doesn't make sense because O2 is the reactant (B). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule. Let's think of another diatomic molecule. Maybe Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. But earlier I thought D is H2, so if E is Cl2, that would require C reacting with H2 to form Cl2, which I don't think is feasible.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. How would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more complex molecule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me get back to the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C must be a salt that, when water is added, breaks down into the metal (A), and two acids.

So perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then:

Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3↑.

But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS:

FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S↑.

H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. So that doesn't give two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a more complex salt, like a sulfite or a carbonate. Let's try a sulfite:

CuSO3 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + H2SO3.

H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. Cu(OH)2 is a base. So F would be H2SO3 (weak acid), but then where's the strong acid?

Hmm. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitrate and a chloride. For example, if C is a double salt that, when water is added, releases both HNO3 (strong acid) and HCl (strong acid). But both are strong, so F and G would both be strong. But the question says F is strong and G is weak.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate and a sulfite. For example, perhaps something like a nitrosulfate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't make sense because it's produced from A and B.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Then:

MgCO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + CO2↑.

CO2 is a weak acid (it's a gas, but in water it forms H2CO3, a weak acid). Mg(OH)2 is a base. So F would be CO2 (which isn't an acid in the solid state but forms an acid in solution), and G would be Mg(OH)2, which is a base. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfonate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a different kind of compound. Let's think about a metal that forms a complex anion which, when water is added, releases two different acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide and a chloride. For example, a double sulfide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide of a transition metal that, when it reacts with water, disproportionates into two different acids.

For example, V2O5 reacts with water to form V(OH)3 and VO(OH)2, but I'm not sure if they're acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to form NaOH and O2. But that would produce a base and a gas, not two acids.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Let me try to think about the overall picture. I have to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, D∞h is the symmetry. O2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the answer would be D∞h.

But earlier, I thought E is formed from C and D (which is H2). So C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is O2, that would imply that C is O2 and the reaction is O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O, but that doesn't fit because E is a gas, and H2O is a liquid. So that's unlikely.

Another possibility: E is a different diatomic molecule. For example, if E is Cl2, but how would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a triatomic molecule. For example, ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry. So if E is O3, the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how would O3 form from C and H2? Not sure.

Wait, let's think. If C is O2, and H2 is D, then perhaps C reacts with H2 to form something else. But that's not matching the reaction description.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, another angle: E is extremely hazardous. So maybe it's a nerve agent, but I don't know the exact structures. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure about their symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. HCN is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N. So yes, its symmetry group is D∞h.

So, if E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

But how would HCN form from C and H2?

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, then reacting with H2 might form HCN. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide. For example, CuCN. Reacting with H2 might reduce it to form HCN.

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the reaction conditions.

Wait, the reaction is C + 2 H2 → E. If E is HCN, then perhaps C is a cyanide compound. For example, maybe C is (NH4)CN, which upon reaction with H2 could produce HCN and NH3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2 → Na + HCN. But the reaction would require some acidic conditions or a catalyst.

Hmm. This is getting a bit too speculative.

Another approach: the symmetry group options. Option C is D∞h, which is for linear molecules. So if E is linear, the symmetry is D∞h. So possible candidates are O2, HCN, CO, NO, Cl2, etc.

If E is O2, then symmetry is D∞h. If E is HCN, same. If E is CO, same. If E is Cl2, same.

But what's the most dangerous of these? O2 is a gas but not extremely hazardous. HCN is highly toxic. Cl2 is dangerous but not as immediately lethal as HCN.

So perhaps E is HCN. Then, the symmetry would be D∞h.

But to get back to the reaction: C + 2 H2 → HCN.

So C would be a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2 → Na + HCN + something else. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO (carbon monoxide), and H2 is D. But CO + H2 doesn't directly form a dangerous product.

Wait, perhaps E is a different compound. Let me think about another possibility: E could be a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), which has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent like sarin, which has a complex structure but perhaps some symmetry. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different diatomic molecule. For example, I2 (iodine) has D∞h symmetry, but it's a solid at room temperature and not a gas, so maybe not.

Another thought: E could be a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) is a liquid and is toxic, but it's tetrahedral, so its symmetry group is Td, which isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule altogether. I'm not making progress here.

Let me try to tie everything together.

If the first reaction forms a bright red solid C, which when reacted with H2 forms E, which is extremely hazardous.

Assuming that C is a sulfide, perhaps Cu2S (but it's black). Or maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the first reaction forms a sulfide. Let's say A is Fe and B is S (but B is a gas, so S is a solid, which doesn't fit).

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different gas. Maybe B is SO2, but that's a gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a reduction. For example, A is a metal oxide, and B is H2. So A (metal oxide) + H2 → metal + H2O. But then C would be the metal, which doesn't fit the 'bright red' description.

Hmm. Another idea: perhaps A is a metal that forms a red-colored oxide. For example, Fe2O3·nH2O is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a different kind of compound, like a coordination compound. For example, [Cu(OH)2]^2- is a blue solid, but not red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but chromium(VI) oxide is orange.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, then the answer is C. But I'm not sure about the exact identity of E.

Another angle: the third reaction produces two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Common strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include HCN, H2CO3, H2SO3.

If F is HCl (strong) and G is HCN (weak), then C might be a chloride cyanide, perhaps. But I'm not familiar with such a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, so that fits. Then, C would be a compound that, when reacted with water, produces H2SO4 and H2S. How?

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that also contains sulfur in another oxidation state. For example, perhaps a sulfide that, when hydrolyzed, produces H2S and sulfuric acid. But I'm not sure of such a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a sulfide and a sulfate. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal sulfide with another functional group. For example, perhaps a metal thiosulfate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal disulfide. For example, FeS2 reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But again, Fe(OH)2 is a base, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The question is about the symmetry group of E. If E is O2, symmetry is D∞h. If E is HCN, symmetry is D∞h. If E is something else linear, same symmetry.

Given the options, and the fact that E is extremely hazardous, I'm inclined to think E is something like O2 or a similar diatomic gas with D∞h symmetry. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like ozone (O3), that's an option. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a molecule with a bent structure, such as SO2, which has a C2v symmetry group. But SO2 isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as O2 or HCN.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with a different structure. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given all this, I think the most likely scenario is that E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a compound with a high oxygen-to-metal ratio. A bright red solid could be copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O), but the exact identity of A and C remains unclear. However, the color and stoichiometry hint at a compound involving oxygen.

2. **Reaction 2**: Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction suggests a transformation involving H₂ (if D is hydrogen) or another gas. The hazard level implies E could be a toxic gas like HCN, O₂, or a nerve agent, but the exact identity is ambiguous.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that decomposes in water, releasing a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a sulfide, it might produce H₂S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, but this does not fully align with the description.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, H could be H₂O, a common solvent.

### Symmetry Analysis:
- The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
  - **A) C₂**: C₂ symmetry involves a single twofold rotation axis.
  - **B) D₄h**: D₄h symmetry includes a fourfold rotation axis, horizontal mirror planes, and a center of inversion.
  - **C) D∞h**: D∞h symmetry applies to linear molecules like O₂, HCN, or Cl₂, with a center of inversion and multiple twofold rotation axes perpendicular to the molecular axis.
  - **D) C₂v**: C₂v symmetry involves a twofold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes, as seen in molecules like O₃ or SO₂.

- If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or HCN, it would have **D∞h symmetry**. O₂ is a common hazardous gas, and HCN is highly toxic, aligning with the description of E as extremely hazardous. Both have linear structures, consistent with D∞h symmetry.

- If E were a bent molecule like O₃ or SO₂, it would have **C₂v symmetry**. However, these molecules are less likely to match the description of E as extremely hazardous compared to diatomic gases like O₂ or HCN.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, assuming E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or HCN.
