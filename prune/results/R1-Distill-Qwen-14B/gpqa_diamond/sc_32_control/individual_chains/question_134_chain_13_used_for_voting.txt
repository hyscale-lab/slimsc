Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, since there are multiple acids and a base here, I need to figure out all the reactions involved.

So, first, let's list out the substances:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and the base involved. Because enthalpy depends on the moles reacting, right?

HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. So, each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each molecule can provide two OH- ions, so each mole gives two equivalents of OH-.

Wait, but when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction might produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate, and water. Similarly, HCl will react with the remaining OH- after that.

Let me think about the steps.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each acid's H+ and the moles of OH- from the base.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate one H+ per mole. So, HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Moles = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So, 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but when mixing the acids and the base, the OH- will react with the H+ from the acids.

So, total H+ available: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

OH- available: 0.2 moles.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat, typically around 57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, what's the exact value? I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

But let's check. The neutralization reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative, indicating heat is released.

So, the total moles of H+ available are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So, the OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28.

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, meaning 0.2 moles of H+ will be consumed, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. When it reacts with a base, the first H+ is more acidic and reacts quickly, but the second H+ is less so. However, in strong bases, I think both H+ ions will react. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.

But wait another point: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the strong acids. So, all the available H+ will react until OH- runs out.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Total H+ from both acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2.

So, OH- is less than H+, so OH- is limiting. So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So, after neutralization, 0.08 moles of H+ remain.

But wait, what about the other products? H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so perhaps if all OH- is consumed, some of the H2SO4 might not be fully neutralized. Let me think. Oh, no, when the OH- neutralizes the H+, it's consuming H+ from both acids.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalents.

Each HCl contributes 1 equivalent per mole (since each mole gives 1 H+).
Each H2SO4 contributes 2 equivalents (since each mole gives 2 H+).
Each Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 equivalents (since each mole gives 2 OH-).

So, total equivalents of acid: (0.1 * 1) + (0.09 * 2) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.
Total equivalents of base: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 eq.

So, the acid is in excess. The base can neutralize 0.2 eq of H+.

So, the neutralization reaction will use 0.2 eq H+ and 0.2 eq OH-.

Wait, but what's the enthalpy per equivalent? Because each mole of H+ (from any acid) and OH- (from any base) reacting releases about the same amount of heat, assuming strong acid and strong base.

But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but diprotic. So, when it reacts, each H+ contributes to the neutralization enthalpy.

So, for each H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ/mol (or kcal? Wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Hmm, I think the standard value is about 57 kJ per mole, which is equivalent to approximately 13.6 kcal/mol because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, let me check the conversion: 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, so 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So, 57 kJ is equal to 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but the options are given in kcal and kJ. So, I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Alternatively, sometimes it's given as about -13.6 kcal per mole.

So, when 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH-, it releases about 57 kJ or 13.6 kcal.

So, in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ (from acids) react with 0.2 moles of OH- (from base), releasing heat.

Wait, no, the moles of H+ consumed is 0.2. So, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Or, if using kcal, 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's interesting because option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. So, which unit should I use?

Looking back at the problem, the options are in both kcal and kJ. Hmm, so perhaps the answer is either A or D. But wait, the question says 'enthalpy of neutralization'— usually, enthalpy of neutralization is expressed per mole of reaction, which is typically per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change when these specific volumes are mixed. So, it's the total heat released due to the neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+.

So, if each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. So, the enthalpy change would be -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 0.2 *57 kJ is 11.4 kJ, which is not in kcal.

Alternatively, if the calculation uses the value in kcal, 0.2 *13.6 kcal is 2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting options here. Let me double-check the values.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization:

H+ + OH- → H2O(l); ΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol)

So, yes, 57.3 kJ per mole or 13.6 kcal per mole.

So, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ, which is approximately 11.46 kJ. So, the enthalpy of neutralization would be -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is quite different. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if using kcal: 0.2 *13.6=2.72 kcal. So, -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but why would the answer be in kcal? Because sometimes chemistry textbooks use kcal, especially in older contexts. But the problem gives both options. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is worded as 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed.' So, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, leading to an enthalpy of 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, or 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

So, the options are A: -2.72 kcal and D: -16.0 kJ. So which is correct?

Wait, another point: when H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in the presence of a diacid, does the second H+ contribute the same as the first? I think yes, because both are strong. So, each H+ from H2SO4 contributes 57 kJ/mol.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28 moles, but only 0.2 moles react. So, the heat released is 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ. So, the answer would be -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 kcal. But 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.6=2.72 kcal. So, that's option A.

But why is there a discrepancy? The problem here is whether the reaction uses kJ or kcal.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different standard value. For example, sometimes the enthalpy is taken as 13.7 kcal per mole, or 57.3 kJ per mole.

Wait, let me think: 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J. To convert that to kcal: 57300 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.69 kcal. So, approximately 13.7 kcal per mole.

So, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.7 = 2.74 kcal. So, that's approximately 2.74 kcal. So, the closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would imply 11.42 kcal, which would be 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. That would correspond to about 0.83 moles of H+ neutralized. But in this problem, we only neutralized 0.2 moles. So that can't be.

So, back to the calculation. The correct enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But the options don't have that. Option D is -16 kJ, which is way higher.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me double-check.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Correct.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- → 0.1 *2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ total is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So, OH- is the limiting reactant. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole releases 57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ released → -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, none have -11.46 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.1 kJ (because 11.42 *4.184≈47.8). So that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps I should not have considered the H+ from H2SO4 as all reacting. Maybe only the first H+ of H2SO4 is neutralized, and the second remains. But that would complicate things.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base, both H+ from H2SO4 would react, right? Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, both protons are donated. So, the initial calculation should be correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ + OH- → H2O. Because when you mix different acids and a base, maybe some other reactions occur, like precipitation.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and a good source of Ba^2+ ions. When mixed with H2SO4, which is H+ and SO4^2-, a precipitation reaction might occur. Because Ba^2+ and SO4^2- can form BaSO4, which is a precipitate.

So, this changes things. Because when Ba(OH)2 is added to H2SO4, a double displacement reaction occurs: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let's write the balanced equation:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O

But wait, the stoichiometry: each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So, this reaction produces one mole of BaSO4 precipitate and releases heat.

Wait, but the enthalpy of this reaction would be a combination of the neutralization and the formation of the precipitate. However, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm. So, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is only considering the H+ and OH- reacting, not the precipitate formation. Or maybe the precipitate's formation contributes to the overall enthalpy change.

Alternatively, the question is perhaps only about the neutralization part, not the precipitation. But neutralization is about H+ and OH- → H2O, so the precipitate's effect is separate.

So, perhaps I should calculate the heat from the neutralization (H+ and OH-) and any additional heat from the precipitation reaction.

Wait, let's think again.

First, the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

The molar amounts:

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The mole ratio is 1:1. So, Ba(OH)2 is in excess by 0.01 mol.

So, all 0.09 mol of H2SO4 will react, producing 0.09 mol of BaSO4 and 0.18 mol of H2O.

Wait, but this reaction involves H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, the reaction is: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Breaking it down, the H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole, and Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole.

So, overall, each mole of H2SO4 will consume 2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, in the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 will donate 2 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 will donate 2 OH-.

The balanced equation would require 1 mole of H2SO4 and 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce BaSO4 and 2 H2O.

So, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But let's think about the H+ and OH-.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So, when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water, and Ba^2+ and SO4^2- will form BaSO4.

So, the reaction involves both acid-base neutralization (H+ + OH- → H2O) and the formation of a precipitate.

But the enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat from the acid-base reaction, not including the precipitation.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The problem says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', which typically refers to the heat from H+ and OH- combining into water. So, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 reaction would release heat due to both the acid-base part and the precipitation.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+. So, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 reaction would release heat from both the neutralization and the precipitation. But without knowing the enthalpy change for the formation of BaSO4, it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to ignore the precipitation and only consider the neutralization of H+ and OH-.

But the presence of Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 will form BaSO4, which is a solid. So, the reaction would proceed as a neutralization plus precipitation.

So, perhaps the problem is designed to have two parts: the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, and then H2SO4 and any remaining Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so when mixed with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, they would neutralize each other, producing BaCl2 and water.

Similarly, the H2SO4 would react with remaining Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate and water.

But let me go step by step.

First, list the acids and base:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, each giving 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, each giving 2 OH- → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, total H+ available: 0.28.

Total OH- available: 0.2.

The neutralization reaction will consume the OH- first, so 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

But the way the substances are mixed, perhaps the stronger acid reacts first. But I think, in reality, both H+ will be available, so the OH- will react with the available H+.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which acid provides H+ first.

But perhaps the order doesn't matter, as all H+ and OH- are available in the mixture.

Alternatively, let's consider the reactions in sequence.

First, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 might react:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Each mole of HCl provides 1 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

But wait, the reaction is:

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid. So, the reaction would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

But the molar ratio is 1:1.

So, moles of HCl: 0.1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So, they would completely neutralize each other, producing 0.1 moles of BaCl2 and 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but in this case, all 0.1 moles of HCl would react with 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.0 moles of HCl and 0.0 moles of Ba(OH)2.

But wait, the initial moles are 0.1 HCl, 0.09 H2SO4, and 0.1 Ba(OH)2.

Wait, if the HCl and Ba(OH)2 react first, they would neutralize each other completely, leaving:

HCl: 0.

Ba(OH)2: 0.0.

And then, the H2SO4 would react with any remaining Ba(OH)2, but since all Ba(OH)2 has reacted, that's not possible.

Wait, but this approach might be incorrect because when multiple acids and a base are mixed, the base will react with the strongest acid first, but perhaps all available H+ and OH- will react. Alternatively, perhaps it's a simultaneous reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute all H+ and OH- available regardless of source, and determine which is in excess.

So, total H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2 (Ba(OH)2).

So, OH- is limiting. All OH- will react, requiring 0.2 moles H+.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

So, the heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is approximately 11.5 kJ. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, 11.46 kJ is about -11.5 kJ, but that's not an option. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than 11.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the actual enthalpy is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the neutralization of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2, which produces BaSO4 precipitate, which releases more heat.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the acid-base reaction, not precipitation. However, the problem might consider the overall enthalpy change, including both neutralization and precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to only consider the neutralization of the Ba(OH)2 with HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but the initial approach was to find all H+ and OH- and proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the student calculate the neutralization of HCl and Ba(OH)2, and then the neutralization of H2SO4 with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me try that approach.

Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) reacts first with HCl (0.1 mol):

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

This reaction consumes 0.1 mol HCl and 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, producing no precipitate.

Now, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.1 = 0 mol.

Wait, no: initial Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. After reaction with 0.1 mol HCl, all Ba(OH)2 is consumed, leaving 0 mol.

Then, the H2SO4 (0.09 mol) will not react with any Ba(OH)2, as it's all consumed.

So, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol, and no OH- to react with.

So, the only neutralization is between HCl and Ba(OH)2, 0.1 mol each, leading to 0.1 mol H+ neutralized.

The enthalpy change would be 0.1 *57.3 kJ = 5.73 kJ. So, -5.73 kJ. But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the H2SO4 also reacts with some OH- from Ba(OH)2 before the HCl is consumed. Because H2SO4 is a stronger acid than HCl? Wait, no. Both are strong acids, so their strengths are about the same. So, perhaps the OH- would react with both acids equally.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization involves all H+ and available OH-.

So, in any case, the approach is:

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

Heat released: 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as 11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.8 kJ.

Hmm, which is much higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value, like 56.9 kJ per mole. 0.2 *56.9=11.38, which is about -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.42 kcal → -47.8 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid-base reaction, but considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps each mole contributes 2 equivalents.

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier. So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 contribute 0.18 moles H+.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ. But no option matches that.

Looking back at the options: option B is -11.42 kcal. Which is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, if the question used the value 13.6 kcal/mol, then 0.2 *13.6=2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both H+ from HCl and H2SO4, but perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is 13.6 kcal, so 0.28 moles would be neutralized, but that's more H+ than OH- available.

Wait, no, because OH- is the limiting factor, only 0.2 moles H+ react.

So, 0.2 *13.6=2.72 kcal → option A.

But why is option B present? It's -11.42 kcal, which is about 25.8 moles of H+? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, the neutralization enthalpy is about -57.3 kJ per mole of HCl (since each mole contributes one H+). For H2SO4, since each mole contributes two H+, the neutralization enthalpy would be about -114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But that complicates the calculation because each acid contributes differently.

Let me think: if the problem is considering each mole of H2SO4 as contributing two moles of H+ and thus two moles of neutralization enthalpy, then the calculation would be:

Heat = (moles of HCl) *57.3 + (moles of H2SO4)*114.6.

But wait, no, because Ba(OH)2 only has 0.2 moles of OH- available.

So, the maximum moles of H+ that can be neutralized is 0.2 moles.

Which would come from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+.

But since only 0.2 moles OH- are available, all H+ will be neutralized until 0.2 moles are consumed.

So, HCl's 0.1 moles H+ are all consumed, and then 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4 are consumed.

So, the heat would be:

0.1 *57.3 (from HCl) + 0.1 * (57.3 *2) (from H2SO4, since each H+ is 57.3 kJ).

Wait, wait, no. Each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+, each giving 57.3 kJ. So, 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4 would give 0.1 *57.3 =5.73 kJ.

So, total heat would be:

HCl: 0.1 *57.3 =5.73 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.1 *57.3 =5.73 kJ.

Total: 11.46 kJ.

So, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.1 kJ. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering all the H+ from H2SO4 and HCl as reacting with the base, and the excess H+ remains.

But the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when they're mixed. So, the heat released during neutralization is due to the H+ and OH- reacting.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the amount of H+ and OH- available, determine the limiting reagent (OH- in this case), and multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So, 0.2 moles reacting → 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: -16.0 kJ.

But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L =0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2:0.5 M *0.2 L= 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles.

So, yes, correct.

So, why is the option not there? Maybe the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but in terms of the acid-base reaction, like 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total equivalents, but that's what I did.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy from all the H+ and OH- that can react, and the excess H+ remains, but the question asks for the total enthalpy change regardless of excess.

So, the total is 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the neutralization for each acid separately, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula for neutralization in terms of the volume and molarity.

Wait, another approach:

The neutralization reaction can be considered as:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O(l); ΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol.

The total moles of H+ available: 0.28.

Moles of OH-: 0.2.

The reaction will proceed until the OH- is exhausted, so 0.2 moles of H+ will react, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the given options have a mistake, but among the options, the closest is option B, which is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, converting 11.46 kJ to kcal: 11.46 /4.184≈2.737 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.2 moles would release more than 2 kcal.

Wait, wait, 57.3 kJ per mole is 13.69 kcal per mole.

0.2 moles would be 2.74 kcal. So, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

So, why is option B so much larger in kcal? That would be 11.42 kcal, which is about 48.3 kJ. But that would require about 0.84 moles of H+.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the limiting reagent, and is instead calculating all H+ from all acids.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles. So, 0.28 moles *57.3 kJ =16.0 kJ. Which is option D.

Wait! 0.28 *57.3=16.044 kJ, which is approximately 16.0 kJ. So, that's option D.

But why would that be the case? Because OH- is 0.2 moles, which is less than 0.28, so only 0.2 moles react.

But perhaps the problem is making a mistake and considering all H+ neutralized, leading to 0.28 *57.3=16.0 kJ. So, the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused between the equivalents and moles.

Wait, another approach: when mixing the three solutions, the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So, the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, releasing 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the intended correct answer is option A, assuming the calculation is done in kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the question is considering the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with both HCl and H2SO4, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the volume and molarity. Because sometimes, the neutralization is calculated based on the volumes and concentrations, not just moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, the moles are what matter, not the volumes. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.

But given that option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 0.28 *57.3=16.0 kJ, perhaps the problem expects that calculation, neglecting the limiting reagent.

So, maybe the correct answer is D).

But that would be incorrect because OH- is limiting. So, only 0.2 moles of H+ react.

But perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the limiting reagent and compute based on all H+ available.

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is to calculate the enthalpy change for the entire mixture, including the formation of BaSO4.

So, for each mole of H2SO4 that reacts with Ba(OH)2, a precipitate is formed, which releases additional heat.

Wait, but the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the acid-base part, not precipitation.

But let me see. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would include the neutralization and the precipitation.

The standard enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated, but I don't remember the exact value. However, the problem might be expecting me to use the neutralization part only.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total H+ and OH- and proceed.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct calculation is 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. But none of the options have that in kJ.

Alternatively, if the calculation is in kcal, 0.2 *13.69=2.74 kcal → option A.

But the problem is that the correct answer isn't present. Maybe the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in terms of the moles of H+ from each acid, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck:

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L =0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the limiting reagent is OH- at 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol H+ react, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

But none of the options have that in kJ. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming all 0.28 H+ are neutralized.

But that would require 0.28 mol OH-, but we only have 0.2.

So, that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, but using the kJ value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kJ, but using the incorrect approach of considering all H+.

So, 0.28 moles *57.3=16.0 kJ, which is option D.

But that can't be right because OH- is limiting.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D.

But that would be a mistake. Alternatively, the problem may have intended for the calculation to ignore the limiting reagent, which would make the answer D.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 produces two moles of H2O per mole of Ba(OH)2, so each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes two OH-, and each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+.

So, in the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, the moles would be:

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 neutralizes two H+ from H2SO4.

So, 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 0.2 moles H+ from H2SO4.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+.

So, all 0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4 can be neutralized by 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think again.

Reaction: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Molar ratio 1:1.

So, moles of H2SO4:0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2:0.1.

So, H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So, all 0.09 moles H2SO4 will react, requiring 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

So, Ba(OH)2 left: 0.1 – 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

Which provides 0.02 moles OH-.

Then, the remaining HCl (0.1 moles H+) will react with the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 moles), which provides 0.02 moles OH-.

So, H+ from HCl: 0.1.

OH- available:0.02.

So, all 0.02 moles OH- will react, consuming 0.02 moles H+ from HCl.

So, the total H+ neutralized:

From H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 *2 H+ = 0.18 moles H+.

From HCl: 0.02 moles H+.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.2 moles.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 *57.3 kJ =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal.

Because 11.42 kcal is approximately 48.4 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which releases more heat.

The reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction can be found, but I don't remember the exact value.

Alternatively, the overall reaction is:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → products.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total moles of H+ from all acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

So, the neutralization would be:

n(H+) = 0.28.

n(OH-) = 0.2.

n(neutralized H+) = min(0.28,0.2) = 0.2.

So, heat released: 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming all H+ are neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate based on the assumption that all H+ are neutralized, regardless of OH- availability.

So, 0.28 moles H+ → 0.28 *57.3=16.0 kJ → option D.

But that would be incorrect because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should choose the option that aligns with 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, which would be about 11.5 kJ. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming all H+ are neutralized.

But I'm not confident. Another way: perhaps the problem is considering the reaction of all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 with the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and any excess H+ doesn't contribute to the enthalpy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the moles.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, providing two OH- per mole, but HCl is monoprotic, H2SO4 is diprotic.

So, total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 =0.28.

Total OH- is 0.2.

So, neutralization: 0.2 moles.

Heat released: 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert 11.46 kJ to kcal.

11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈2.737 kcal.

So, -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

But why would the option B be so much higher?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of reaction considering the stoichiometry, which for H2SO4 would be two moles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Enthalpy = (moles of H+ from HCl + 2 * moles of H2SO4) × enthalpy per H+.

So, (0.1 + 2*0.09) =0.28 → 0.28 ×57.3=16.0 kJ.

Which is option D.

But that would be considering all H+ available, which isn't possible because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

But perhaps the problem expects that approach, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation to be done per mole of H+ from all sources.

But if that's the case, the correct answer would be 0.2 moles ×57.3 kJ =11.46 kJ, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D, considering all H+.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I think the intended answer is D) -16.0 kJ.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Moles of H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   - **HCl**: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H⁺.  
   - **H₂SO₄**: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H₂SO₄, contributing 2 H⁺ per mole → 0.18 moles H⁺.  
   - **Ba(OH)₂**: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)₂, contributing 2 OH⁻ per mole → 0.2 moles OH⁻.  

   Total H⁺ available: \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total OH⁻ available: \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  

2. **Limiting Reagent**:  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)) than H⁺ (\( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \)).

3. **Heat Released**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   Since 0.2 moles of OH⁻ react, the heat released is:  
   \[
   0.2 \, \text{moles} \times 57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kcal:  
   \[
   11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx 2.737 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]  

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated \( -2.737 \, \text{kcal} \), assuming the reaction uses kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: This would correspond to approximately \( 48.1 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated \( 11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Does not match any part of the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: This corresponds to \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \times 57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 16.044 \, \text{kJ} \), but this assumes all \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ are neutralized, which is incorrect because OH⁻ is limiting.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct calculation based on the limiting reagent (OH⁻) gives \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) or \( -2.737 \, \text{kcal} \). Among the options, the closest match is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.
