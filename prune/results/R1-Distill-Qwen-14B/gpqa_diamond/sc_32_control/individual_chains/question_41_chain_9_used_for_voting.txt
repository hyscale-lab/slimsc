Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in a moving medium, specifically glass. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes depending on the medium's refractive index. But wait, this medium, the glass, is moving relative to the observer. That complicates things a bit.

Alright, let's read the problem again. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Oh, but wait, the beam is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Hmm, but light is going through the glass. So how does the movement of the glass affect the observed speed of light?

I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Because this is about the speed of light in a medium, not necessarily about inertial frames moving relative to each other. Or maybe it is. Let me think.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_glass = c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames. But this isn't a vacuum; it's glass. So the speed depends on the medium. So how does the movement of the medium factor in?

Maybe I should consider the velocity transformations. Let's see, if in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. Then, when the glass moves at velocity v, the lab frame would see the light's velocity as v_light' = (v_light + v)/(1 + (v_light * v)/c²). Wait, but wait, that's the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But does that apply here? Because the light is in the glass, not in a vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium is still c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But that doesn't sound right because the medium's motion would affect the light's speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but if the glass is moving, the speed of the light in the lab frame might be different. So let's model this. Let me define the frames. The lab frame is S, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is also towards the observer. Hmm, but the light is going through the glass, so it's going in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is v_g = c/n. So in the lab frame, what would the speed be?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the velocity addition formula again. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the original frame, and u' is the velocity in the frame moving at speed v relative to the original.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Wait, no. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So the lab frame sees the glass moving at v. So to transform from the glass's frame (where u is c/n) to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. Let me clarify the directions. Let's say in the glass's frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass is moving relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the speed of light is u = c/n. The lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass frame (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). So to find the speed in the lab frame, we apply the velocity addition.

So, the formula would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, no. Because when transforming from the moving frame to the rest frame, the direction of v matters. Let me think. Wait, no, the formula is correct as stated when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in this case, the glass's frame is S', and the lab is S. So the lab sees S' moving at velocity v. So to find u', which is the speed in the lab frame, we use u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). 

Wait, but wait. Wait no. Because in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n, and the lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). Because the lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, the lab is moving at -v in the glass frame).

Wait, no, that's getting me confused. I think I should get this straight. Let's take S as the lab frame, and S' as the glass's frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in S. So, to find the speed of light in S, which is the lab frame, we can transform from S' to S.

In S', the speed of light is u' = c/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because when you have a frame S' moving at v relative to S, the velocity in S is given by u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

So substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify this:

The denominator becomes 1 + (v/(n c)).

So, u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / (1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c
Denominator: n c (1) + v

Wait, wait, let me re-express the denominator. 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

Wait, so the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check:

Wait, [ (c + n v)/n ] divided by [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ] is equal to [ (c + n v) * c ] / [ n (n c + v ) ) ].

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

u = numerator / denominator

numerator = (c + n v) / n

denominator = (n c + v) / (n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator cancels with the n c in the numerator, leaving:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's [c(c + n v)] / [c n + v ]

Wait, the denominator is c n + v, and the numerator is c^2 + c n v.

So, u = [c^2 + c n v ] / [ c n + v ]

Wait, but if we factor out c from numerator and denominator, let's see:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c n + v = c n + v → it's the same as the denominator.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this differently. Let me factor c from denominator:

Denominator = c n + v = c(n) + v → can't factor c out unless it's c (n + v/c ), but not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should substitute c=1, as per the problem statement.

So, substituting c=1, the expression becomes:

u = (1 + n v) * 1 / (n *1 + v )

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which matches option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the velocity addition formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it in the lab frame. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be the speed inside the glass (c/n) plus the speed of the glass (v), but that's only in the case of classical addition, which is wrong according to relativity.

Wait, but that's the Galilean addition, which isn't correct. So using the relativistic formula is necessary here, because when velocities are a significant fraction of c, Galilean addition doesn't hold.

So according to the velocity addition formula, the correct calculation is as I did earlier, leading to option A.

But wait, let me double-check the options. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v), which with c=1 is exactly what I got.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has a refractive index \( n \), and light travels through it at a speed of \( c/n \) in the glass's rest frame. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer in the lab frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Rest Frame of the Glass**:  
   In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = c/n \).

2. **Lab Frame**:  
   The lab frame observes the glass moving at velocity \( v \). To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \), we get:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Simplify the denominator:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]  
   Thus, the expression becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]  
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to eliminate fractions:  
   \[
   u = \frac{c (c + n v)}{n c + v}
   \]  
   Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which matches **Option A**.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)  
  This matches the derived expression and is correct.  
- **Option B**: \( 1 \)  
  Incorrect, as the speed of light in a medium is not always \( c \).  
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)  
  Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the derived expression.  
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)  
  Incorrect, as the numerator does not match the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
