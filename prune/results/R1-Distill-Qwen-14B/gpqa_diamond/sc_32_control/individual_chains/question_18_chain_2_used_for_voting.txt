Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses compared to the Sun. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I'm not sure if that matters here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Oh right, photospheric compositions are given using the EW method, which I think is equivalent width, but maybe that's not directly important for this calculation.

The data provided includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. And the Sun's photosphere has certain values: 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, and 12 + log(nMg/nH) is 7. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so Ratio = Si_1 / Si_2.

Wait, let me remember what these brackets mean. The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y in the star compared to the Sun.

Let me break down each star.

Starting with Star_1. Its [Fe/H] is 0, which means the number of Fe atoms relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 implies that nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, the Sun's values are given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) for the Sun is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, the Sun's log(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5, so nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^(-5).

Wait, no, wait. The way it's given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5-12= -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, it's 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So Fe is the same as Sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, but we don't know nH1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H], but since [Fe/H]=0, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H], because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] = [Si/H]. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which equals [Si/H]_1. So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun). And that's 0.3.

So log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) + 0.3.

But what's nSi_sun / nH_sun? I don't have that directly, but maybe I can find it from the given data. Wait, the Sun's data is for Fe and Mg, not Si. Hmm. Do I have the Sun's [Si/Fe] or [Mg/Si]?

Wait, I think I need to make some assumptions. Since the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg, perhaps we can consider that the Sun's Si abundance is determined by some other means, but wait, no, the problem doesn't provide that. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? No, that's not right. The Sun's [X/Fe] is sometimes used as a reference. But in this problem, the data only gives Fe, Mg, and for the stars, Si and Mg in their respective ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the abundances using the given ratios.

Wait, let's think about Star_1 first. We know [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means the Fe abundance is solar. So the Si abundance relative to Fe is 0.3 dex higher. So Si is more abundant relative to Fe in Star_1 than in the Sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means (nSi1 / nFe1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, what's nFe1? Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. Similarly, nH1 is the number density of H in Star_1's photosphere.

Wait, but for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). So nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun. So nFe1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH1.

Similarly, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 * nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 * (10^(-4.5) nH1) )

But this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by considering the ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the abundance ratios in terms of [X/H].

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So [Fe/H] = 0 → Fe abundance is solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1, substituting:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 
= (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log( (nSi_sun / nH_sun * nH1) *10^0.3 / nH1 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)
= log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)
= log(10^0.3) = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Wait, that's consistent with earlier thinking. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's see.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

And from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) nH2, we get:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2 ) /nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Solving for nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * nH2 * 1/(10^0.3) )

So nSi2 /nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (1/10^0.3 )

So [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *1/(10^0.3) ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(1/(10^0.3)) = -0.3.

Wait, wait. Because [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi2 = (nMg2 *nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, since [Mg/H]=0 for Star_2, nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 / nH_sun). And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So substituting nMg2 from the first equation into the second:

(nMg_sun * nH2/nH_sun) / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: nH2/nH_sun /nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun ) → nH2/(nH_sun nSi2 ) = 10^0.3.

Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to express nSi2 in terms of nH2.

Alternatively, let me compute [Si/H] for Star_2.

We can write [Mg/Si]_2 as [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]. Because [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

We know [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So:

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So for Star_2, [Si/H] is -0.3. Which means the silicon abundance is lower than solar by 0.3 dex.

So now, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi1 /nH1) divided by (nSi2 /nH2) → (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2 ).

But this ratio is (nSi1 nH2 ) / (nH1 nSi2 ).

Hmm, but we don't know nH1 or nH2. Oh, but wait, in stars, the total number of hydrogen is roughly the same as the total number of particles, but perhaps it's hard to say without more info.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the ratio as ( [Si/H]_1 + [Si/H]_2 )? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the ratio is (nSi1 / nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) = (nSi1 /nSi2 ) * (nH2 /nH1 ).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, nH2/nH1, I can't compute this directly.

Wait, but perhaps the hydrogen density is the same for both stars? No, that's not necessarily true. They have different masses, but that's more about the overall size and luminosity, not necessarily H density in the photosphere.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the problem again.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. That is, what is (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 /nH2)? Because that gives (nSi1 /nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2 ) = (nSi1 nH2 )/(nH1 nSi2 ).

But I don't have information about the H densities in each star. Wait, but the Sun's photosphere has a certain nH_sun, and each star's nH depends on their own conditions.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps assume that the H density is the same in both stars? That's a big assumption, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's acceptable.

If nH1 =nH2, then the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) )= (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH1) ) = (nSi1/nSi2 ) × (nH1 /nH1 )=nSi1/nSi2.

But wait, I don't know if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined.

Wait, but in the Sun, the number density of H is a given, but for the stars, their H density would depend on their gravity and temperature, which we don't have. Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here.

Wait, another approach: express everything in terms of the Sun's abundance.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) +0.3 → nSi1 = nH1 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2)= log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3 → nSi2 =nH2 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^(-0.3).

So the ratio Si_1/Si_2 is (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) = [ (nH1 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^0.3 ) /nH1 ] / [ (nH2 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^(-0.3) ) /nH2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) × 10^0.3.

Denominator = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^(-0.3).

So ratio = [10^0.3] / [10^(-0.3)] = 10^(0.3 +0.3) ) =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 3.9 or 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Alternatively, let me compute 10^0.6. 10^0.6 is the same as e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(1.3816) ≈ 3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which would round to ~3.9. So the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships between logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
   - Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Thus, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.
   - Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we find:
     \[
     [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
     \]

3. **Sun's Photosphere**:
   - The Sun's silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio is not explicitly provided, but it is consistent across both stars when comparing their [Si/H] values.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}.
\]
Using the logarithmic abundance ratios:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Calculating \(10^{0.6}\):
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \, \text{(rounded to ~3.9)}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
