Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. 

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be represented on a Bloch sphere, which is like a way to visualize quantum states in a 3D space.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a unit sphere in three dimensions, right? Each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. The pure states |0> and |1> are at the poles of the sphere. |0> is at (0,0,1) and |1> is at (0,0,-1), I think. But this is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state if it's not a pure state. 

Let me see: the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is a projector, same with |1><1|. So adding those gives a matrix. Let me compute what this looks like. 

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0s except 1 at (2,2). Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So ρ is (1/2) times that. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

Wait, that's the completely mixed state for a qubit. I remember that the completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which has equal probability for both states |0> and |1>. So where does that place it on the Bloch sphere?

The Bloch sphere representation for a general qubit state is given by the vector r = (x, y, z), where x = <σx>, y = <σy>, z = <σz>, and σ are the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix ρ, the expectation values are calculated as Tr(ρ σ_i) for each i. 

So let's compute these. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

First, compute Tr(ρ σz). Since ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|), so ρ is diag(1/2, 1/2). σz is diag(1, -1). The product ρ σz is diag(1/2*1, 1/2*(-1))= diag(1/2, -1/2). The trace is 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0. 

Similarly, Tr(ρ σx): ρ is diag(1/2, 1/2), σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The product is [[ (1/2)(0) + (1/2)(1), ... wait, maybe it's easier to compute Tr(ρ σx) directly. Alternatively, since the density matrix is diagonal, and σx is off-diagonal, their product will have elements that are 1/2*(1) at (1,2) and (2,1). The trace is the sum of diagonal elements. But σx is traceless, so Tr(ρ σx) would be [ (1/2 * 0) + (1/2 * 0) ] because the diagonal terms of σx are zero. So Tr(ρ σx) = 0. Same for Tr(ρ σy), because σy is also traceless, and the product would have zero diagonal elements. So all the expectation values are zero. 

So the vector r would be (0, 0, 0). Wait, but wait a second. The origin in the Bloch sphere? Because my density matrix is maximally mixed, which is the same as having no preferred state. So the state is in the center of the Bloch sphere. So the position is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the probabilities of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are equal. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. On the Bloch sphere, a qubit state is represented by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x)\), \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y)\), and \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z)\), with \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) being the Pauli matrices.

1. **Compute \(z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z)\):**  
   \(\rho\) is diagonal with entries \([1/2, 1/2]\), and \(\sigma_z\) is diagonal with entries \([1, -1]\). The product \(\rho \sigma_z\) has diagonal entries \([1/2, -1/2]\), and the trace is \(1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\).

2. **Compute \(x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x)\):**  
   \(\sigma_x\) is off-diagonal, and since \(\rho\) is diagonal, the diagonal elements of \(\rho \sigma_x\) are zero. Thus, \(\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = 0\).

3. **Compute \(y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y)\):**  
   Similarly, \(\sigma_y\) is off-diagonal and traceless, so the diagonal elements of \(\rho \sigma_y\) are zero. Thus, \(\text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = 0\).

Since all expectation values \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are zero, the density matrix corresponds to the vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\) in the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. This represents the maximally mixed state, which has no preferred direction and is equally distant from all pure states.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
