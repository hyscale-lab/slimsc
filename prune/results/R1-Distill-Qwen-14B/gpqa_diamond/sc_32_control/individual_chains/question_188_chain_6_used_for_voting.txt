Okay, I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think this through.

So the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with some values around 9 to 10 Angstrom.

Wait, interplanar distance? Oh right, that's the d-spacing for a particular set of planes. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the Bragg formula, but wait, no, that's for the diffraction condition. The actual calculation for the interplanar spacing uses the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is something like 1/(d) squared is equal to (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) + some terms involving the cosines of the angles. Oh wait, but this is for a general crystal system, maybe a triclinic one. Right, for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case where a = b = c and all angles are equal, so α=β=γ.

So in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, let's say 'a'. The angles are all equal too, 30 degrees here. The Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

I think the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system might be a bit simpler. Let's see, the general formula for d_hkl is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ)/(a²) but wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is based on the unit cell vectors.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d can be found using the formula derived from the structure factor, which for a cubic system is simple, but for rhombohedral it's a bit more involved.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, since all a, b, c are equal and all angles are equal, maybe we can model it as a cube with certain distortions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal.

The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c)

But wait, this can't be right. Wait, I think the correct formula for d² is:

d² = (a² b² c²) / [ (h^2 (b c sin α)^2 + k^2 (a c sin β)^2 + l^2 (a b sin γ)^2 ) + 2 h k a b c (cos(γ - β)) + 2 h l a b c (cos(β - α)) + 2 k l a b c (cos(α - γ)) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system, which simplifies things because a = b = c and α = β = γ.

So given that, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom (since the interatomic distance is 10 A, but wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice constant a is the interatomic distance if it's a simple structure, but maybe I'm assuming it's a simple cubic. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is more complex. Wait, no, the interatomic distance might not necessarily be the lattice parameter. Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong. The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of cubic system, but with a certain distortion.

Wait, but wait a rhombohedral system is a special case where all a = b = c, but angles can be different from 90 degrees. So in our case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, so the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So for a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a is equal to the interatomic distance because each atom is at the corners of the cube and perhaps in the center? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. A simple cubic structure has atoms at the corners only, so the interatomic distance is a√3/√3? No, wait, in a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a. Because each corner atom is along the x, y, and z axes, so nearest neighbor is along the edge, so distance a. So in that case, the interatomic distance is a, so a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but rhombohedral can have other structures, like maybe a face-centered or body-centered arrangement, but I think in this question, it's a simple rhombohedral structure. So perhaps a is 10 Angstrom. So for a rhombohedral structure, a = interatomic distance.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure, but let's proceed with that assumption.

So, the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d^2 = (a²)/(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)

Wait, that rings a bell. Alternatively, perhaps that's for the case where all three indices are the same. Wait, no, wait, for a general case, the formula is more complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos γ) + 2(hl \cos β) + 2(kl \cos α)}}

But wait, in our case, since α = β = γ = 30 degrees, and a = 10.

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So substituting:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) ]

Simplify the denominator:

1+1+1 = 3

Each cos 30 is √3/2 ≈0.866.

So each 2*(1*1 * 0.866) = 2*(0.866) = approx 1.732. But there are three such terms, so 3 * 1.732 = approx 5.196.

So the denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So d^2 = (10^2) / 8.196 = 100 /8.196 ≈12.202.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the denominator is (3 + 5.196) = 8.196, so d^2 is 100 / 8.196 ≈12.202. So d is sqrt(12.202) ≈3.491 Angstrom? That can’t be right because the options are all around 9 Angstrom. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-examine. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \alpha + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \gamma } }

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So, for (111):

d^2 = a² / [1 +1 +1 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 ]

Wait, that's 3 + 2*3*(√3/2) → 3 + 3√3.

Wait, 3√3 is approximately 5.196, so denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196) → a is 10.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) → sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's way too small compared to the options given (which are about 9-10). So either I messed up the formula, or my initial assumption about a being 10 is wrong.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance isn't the same as the lattice parameter a. Oh, that's possible. For example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2 / 2 or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a in terms of the interatomic distance. Let's think.

In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of cubic with angles not 90 degrees, the nearest neighbor distance might not be a.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of a cube and perhaps the center of each face, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a primitive cell, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral crystal is given by the edge length of the unit cell multiplied by the square root of 2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the structure. Suppose each atom is at a corner of the unit cell, then the distance would be a multiplied by the square root of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2), but that's for the (111) direction. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the lattice parameter a in terms of the given interatomic distance. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. The interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbor atoms. In a rhombohedral structure, what are the nearest neighbors? For a simple cubic structure, each corner atom is connected to others via edges, face, and body diagonals. But in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbors could be along the edges, but with a modified angle.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance 'd' is the length of the edge of the unit cell. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is calculated using the dot product of the vectors.

In a rhombohedral unit cell, the vectors are a, a, a but with angles of 30 degrees between each other.

Wait, another approach: the nearest neighbor distance 'd' can be found from the unit cell vectors. The vectors are a along x, a along y, and a along z, but the angles between each pair are 30 degrees.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance would be the minimum distance between any two lattice points. So the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is a, but perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the vectors are not orthogonal, so the actual distance might be different.

Wait, perhaps I should model the unit cell as a cube with vectors a, a, a but with angles between them. The distance between two adjacent points would then be determined by those vectors.

Wait, the position vectors of the atoms can be considered as vectors in a rhombohedral lattice. The distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) would be calculated using the vectors. Let's say the lattice vectors are a (along x), a (along y), a (along z), but with angles between each pair of vectors equal to 30 degrees.

Wait, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is just the magnitude of the first vector, which is 'a'. So the interatomic distance along the x-axis is a. But wait, perhaps that's not the nearest neighbor. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) might be closer in terms of Euclidean distance due to the angles between the vectors.

Wait, let me think of the unit cell vectors. The rhombohedral lattice can be described by three vectors a1, a2, a3, each of length a, with the angles between each pair being 30 degrees. The positions of the atoms are given by n1 a1 + n2 a2 + n3 a3, where n1, n2, n3 are integers.

So the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is |a1|, which is a. Similarly, the distance between (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) is a, same for (0,0,1). What about the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0)? That would be the magnitude of a1 - a2. Let's compute that.

a1 and a2 are vectors of length a, with an angle of 30 degrees between them. The distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is |a1 - a2|. The magnitude squared is |a1|^2 + |a2|^2 - 2 a1·a2. Which is a² + a² - 2 a² cos(30 degrees) = 2a² (1 - cos30). So the distance is a√[2(1 - cos30)].

What's the numerical value? cos30 is about 0.866, so 1 - 0.866 = 0.134. 2 * 0.134 = 0.268. Square root is about 0.517. Multiply by a, so the distance is about 0.517a.

Wait, that's shorter than a. Hmm, so the nearest neighbor distance is 0.517a, which is the interatomic distance. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So 0.517a = 10 → a = 10 / 0.517 ≈19.34 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's a very large lattice parameter. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) in the rhombohedral lattice.

The displacement vector is a1 - a2. The magnitude squared is a² + a² - 2a² cosθ, where θ is 30 degrees. So 2a²(1 - cos30). So the distance is a sqrt(2(1 - cos30)).

So if that's the nearest neighbor distance, and it's given as 10 Angstrom, then:

a * sqrt(2 (1 - cos30)) ) = 10

So a = 10 / sqrt(2 (1 - cos30)).

Compute 2 (1 - cos30) = 2*(1 - (√3/2)) )= 2 - √3 ≈ 2 - 1.732 ≈ 0.268.

So sqrt(0.268) ≈ 0.517. So a ≈ 10 / 0.517 ≈19.34 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's a very large a. Let me proceed with this value.

Now, going back to the d-spacing calculation for (111) plane.

Using the formula:

d² = a² / [ (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) ]

As before. So denominator is 3 + 3*(2*(√3/2)) )= 3 + 3*(√3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d² = (19.34)^2 / 8.196.

19.34^2 is about 374. So 374 /8.196 ≈45.68.

So d ≈ sqrt(45.68) ≈6.76 Angstrom. But none of the options are near 6.7. The options are 9-ish. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is a, not the nearest neighbor distance. Because in the simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a (along the edge), so perhaps in this case, a=10 Angstrom.

But then when I calculated d for (111) as 3.49 Angstrom, which didn't match the options. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula for d-spacing.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me look up the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Upon reflection, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but wait, in rhombohedral, all angles are equal, so cos α = cos β = cos γ. So for (111):

d^2 = a^2 / [ 3 + 2(1 + 1 + 1) cos30 ]

Wait, because the terms hk, hl, kl are each 1*1=1. So 2*(1+1+1) =6.

So denominator is 3 +6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3.

Which is the same as before. So with a=10, denominator is 3+5.196=8.196. So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom. Again, not matching the options.

But wait, the options are in the 9-10 range. So perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance is not a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is a multiplied by sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + ... ) for (100) planes. Hmm, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance in the (111) direction is the same as the nearest neighbor distance? But in that case, if the nearest neighbor distance is 10, then d would be 10. But that's not matching the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't the same. Maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar distance, which is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 b^2 c^2) / ( (h l (b c sin α)^2 + ... )) ]^(1/2)

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α=β=γ=30°, so this simplifies.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell is a^3, but with angles, maybe it's a^3 multiplied by some factor.

Wait, perhaps using the relationship for the volume. The volume V of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a^3 multiplied by the square root of some term.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe using the relation between the d-spacing and the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l), but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for d-spacing for a rhombohedral system that I found online. But since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on my memory.

Another thought: The interplanar distance in a cubic system is given by a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral system, which is a form of cubic but with non-90 angles, the formula must include the angles.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

In our case, since all angles are 30 degrees, and a=10.

So for (111):

d² = 10² / [1 +1 +1 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 ]

Which is:

100 / [3 + 6*(√3/2) ]

Which is 100/(3 + 3√3)

3√3 is about 5.196, so denominator is 8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's way too low compared to the options. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption about 'a' being 10.

Alternative approach: Maybe 'a' is not the interatomic distance. Let me think about the structure of a rhombohedral crystal. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps 'a' is the edge length, but the interatomic distance is a multiplied by sqrt(2), or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure could be along the (111) direction.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral structure might be along the (1,1,1) direction. So the distance would be the length of the vector (a, a, a) when considering the rhombohedral vectors. Wait, no, that's the diagonal of the unit cell, which is probably longer than the nearest neighbor distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along the (100) direction, which would be length a, but that depends on the structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a rhombohedral structure is a cube that's been distorted, so the nearest neighbor distance is a. So in that case, a=10. Then, the d-spacing calculation would be as before, giving 3.49 Angstrom, which is not matching any options.

Another thought: Maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me try to derive it correctly.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 (b c \sin \alpha)^2 + k^2 (a c \sin \beta)^2 + l^2 (a b \sin \gamma)^2 ) + 2 h k a b c \cos(\gamma - \beta) + 2 h l a b c \cos(\beta - \alpha) + 2 k l a b c \cos(\alpha - \gamma) ) } }

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30°, so this simplifies.

Let's substitute a = b = c = a.

So, each term becomes:

h² (a a sin30)^2 = h² a^4 (0.5)^2 = h² a^4 (1/4)

Similarly for the other terms.

So, the first part becomes:

( h² (a² sin α )^2 ) = (h² a^4 (1/4) )

Similarly, same for k and l.

So, summing up the three terms:

h² a^4 (1/4) + k^2 a^4 (1/4) + l^2 a^4 (1/4) = a^4 (1/4)(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 )

The cross terms are:

2 h k a^3 cos(0) (because γ - β =0 ), same for others.

So 2hk a^3 *1, and same for other terms.

So the denominator inside the square root becomes:

a^4 (1/4)(h² +k² + l²) + 2 a^3 (hk + hl + kl) * 1

Factor out a^3:

a^3 [ (a (h² +k² + l²)/4 ) + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.

Given that a is 10 Angstrom, h=k=l=1.

Let's compute each part:

First part: a^4 (1/4)(1+1+1) = 10^4 * (3/4) = 10000 * 0.75 = 7500.

Second part: 2 a^3 (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2 *10^3 *3 = 2000 *3 = 6000.

So the denominator is sqrt(7500 +6000) = sqrt(13500) = approx 116.189.

So d_{hkl} = 1 / (116.189) ≈0.0086 Angstrom^-1. Wait, that's not correct. Because d is in Angstrom, so perhaps I missed a unit conversion.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different scaling factor.

Wait, maybe the formula I'm using is for reciprocal space. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using vectors.

Let me model the unit cell vectors as a, b, c with angles between each pair of 30 degrees. The vectors are:

a = a * (1, 0, 0)

b = a * (cos30, sin30, 0 )

c = a * (cos30, 0, sin30 )

Wait, but perhaps the angle between a and b is 30 degrees, between a and c is 30 degrees, and between b and c is 30 degrees. So the positions of the atoms are given by lattice points.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the sum of the reciprocal lattice vectors:

d_{hkl} = 1 / |h a^* + k b^* + l c^* |

But I'm not confident about this approach.

Another approach: The Miller indices (hkl) define a plane, and the distance between adjacent planes is the interplanar distance. The formula for d is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha } }

But wait, is that correct? Because in a cubic system, when α=90°, the formula becomes d= a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l²)), which is correct. So perhaps in rhombohedral, it's similar.

Wait, but no. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between axes are not 90 degrees, so the formula must account for that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But since in our case, the angles are 30 degrees, and a=10.

So for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 2*(1 + 1 + 1) cos30 )

Which is same as before, 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) =10 / sqrt(3+3√3) ≈10/ sqrt(8.196) ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that still doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the initial assumption that a=10 is wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two (111) planes, but that's unlikely. No, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in that direction.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the given interatomic distance is along a different direction, say along the (100) direction, which would make a=10. But that leads back to the same issue.

Alternatively, maybe I need to reverse the formula. Perhaps d is given by a multiplied by some factor involving the angles.

Wait, another approach: Let's use the relation between lattice parameters and the unit cell vectors.

The unit cell vectors are:

a1 = a (1, 0, 0)

a2 = a (cos α, sin α, 0 )

a3 = a (cos α, 0, sin α )

Wait, no, perhaps a3 is more complex considering the angles.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, the three vectors can be represented as:

a1 = a (1, 0, 0 )

a2 = a (cos α, sin α, 0 )

a3 = a (cos α, 0, sin α )

But I'm not sure about the exact representation. Alternatively, perhaps the third vector a3 has components (cos α, sin α cos β, sin α sin β), but since all angles are equal, perhaps it's (cos α, sin α cos α, sin α sin alpha )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = ( 2π/a ) (1, 0, 0 )

b2 = ( 2π/a ) ( cos α, sin α, 0 )

b3 = ( 2π/a ) ( cos α, sin α cos α, sin α sin α )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ],
       [a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
       [a² cos α, a² cos alpha, a² ] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor g^(-1) is used to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for d-spacing in terms of the metric tensor.

The formula for d² is:

d² = 1 / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos gamma ]

Wait, no, that's when a=b=c and angles are all equal. So in this case, for rhombohedral:

d² = 1 / [ (h² +k² + l²) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos gamma ]

But since all angles are 30 degrees and a=b=c=1 (unit vectors?), perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma )

Which, given that a=10, and all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1, gives:

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1)(1) * cos30 + 2*(1)(1) * cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*√3 )

So denominator sqrt(3 +5.196)= sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's nowhere near the options. So I must be making a wrong assumption about 'a' being 10.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate 'a' based on the given interatomic distance. Let me think again.

The interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the structure. Let's imagine the structure has atoms at (0,0,0) and (1,0,0). The vector between them is a1. So the distance is |a1|=a. So interatomic distance d= a.

But given that, a=10.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, such as (1,1,1), which would be the diagonal.

So the displacement vector is a1 + a2 + a3. The magnitude would be sqrt( (a)^2 + (a)^2 + (a)^2 + 2 a^2 cos30 + 2 a^2 cos30 + 2 a^2 cos30 )

Which is sqrt(3a² +6 a² cos30 )

Which is a * sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) ) = a * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

So if the interatomic distance along (111) is 10, then:

a * sqrt(3 + 3√3 )=10 → a=10 / sqrt(3+3√3 )

Calculate denominator: 3+3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)= 2.863.

So a=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Now, with a=3.49, let's compute the interplanar distance for (111) plane.

Using earlier formula:

d= a / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2)) )

Which is 3.49 / sqrt(8.196) → 3.49 / 2.863 ≈1.22 Angstrom. Still way too low.

Hmm, maybe the interatomic distance is the edge length a. So a=10.

But that brings us back to the earlier result of d≈3.49 Angstrom, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a primitive unit cell and we're looking for the d-spacing, but I'm not seeing how that would change things.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system, but it's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) (1/a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos alpha) (1/a² )

Wait, with a=10, and for (111):

1/d²= (3)(1/100) + 2(3 * (sqrt(3)/2) ) (1/100 )

= 3/100 + (3*sqrt(3) )/100

= (3 +5.196)/100 → 8.196/100=0.08196.

So d²=1/0.08196 ≈12.202 → d≈3.49 Angstrom.

Same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is that the given interatomic distance is the edge length a. Then, the interplanar distance (d) is 10/(sqrt(8.196))=3.49 Angstrom. But since none of the options match, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, but the options are all around 9-10 Angstrom. Let me think if I can get an answer in that range.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d-spacing is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/a². So for (111), d = a /sqrt(3) → 10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal correctly.

Wait, another thought: maybe the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance in the (200) direction, which is a√2. If a√2=10 → a=10/sqrt(2)=7.071.

Then, using that a=7.071, compute d for (111):

d= a/sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2)) → a=7.071.

Denominator sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=7.071/2.863≈2.47 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, such as (220). The distance would be sqrt(2^2 +2^2 +0^2 + 2*2*2* cos30) → wait, not exactly. Let me model the vectors.

Wait, wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, which would be a√3, but considering the angles.

Wait, the displacement vector (1,1,1) in a rhombohedral system would have a magnitude of sqrt( a² +a^2 +a^2 + 2 a² cos30 + 2 a² cos30 + 2 a² cos30 )

Which is a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

So interatomic distance d = a * sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2)) ) =a * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

If given d=10, then a=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 ) → same as before, a≈3.49.

Then, interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2)) ) → 3.49 / 2.863≈1.22 Angstrom. Still no.

Hmm, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the interplanar distance is computed using the reciprocal of the structure factor, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me think about another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

But then, with angles being 30°, perhaps cos30=1. 2*(hk +..) would be 6, so denominator 9, so d=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333. Still no.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Plugging α=30°, cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

Compute:

1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3.

0.866^2≈0.75 → 3*0.75=2.25.

0.866^3≈0.866*0.75≈0.6495 → 2*0.6495=1.299.

So:

1 -2.25 +1.299=1 -2.25= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=≈0.2214.

So V=a^3 * 0.2214 → V= (10)^3 *0.2214=2214 Angstrom^3.

Now, the interplanar distance d is related to the reciprocal of the structure factor, but I'm not sure.

But perhaps using the relation between d and the volume:

d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) )

But same as before.

Wait, unless I'm missing a factor involving the volume. Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. The calculations based on the initial approach don't match the options, but I can't see where I went wrong. Maybe the correct answer is option C:9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, but how?

Another thought: Perhaps the formula for d-spacing is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

But for (111):

3 -3 =0 → division by zero. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the Miller indices as (100), but the question is about (111), so that's not applicable.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is using the simple cubic formula, ignoring the angles. So for (111), d= a/sqrt(3)=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct and the options are wrong. But I must choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another way.

The general formula for d is:

1/d² = (h² /a²) + (k² /b²) + (l² /c²) - 2 hk cosγ/(a b) - 2 hl cosβ/(a c) - 2 kl cos alpha/(b c )

But in our case, a=b=c=10, and all angles are 30°, so:

1/d² = (3/100) - 2*(3)*(cos30)/ (10*10 )

Wait, because hk=1, etc.

So 3/100 - (6 * cos30)/100.

cos30 is 0.866, so 6*0.866=5.196.

So 1/d² = 3/100 -5.196/100 = (3-5.196)/100 = (-2.196)/100 = -0.02196.

But that gives d² negative, which is impossible. So this can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed the negative signs in the formula. Let me re-express the general formula correctly.

The correct formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = (h²/(a²)) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) - (2 hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2 hl cos β)/(a c) - (2 kl cos α)/(b c )

But in our case, a=b=c=10, and all angles are 30°, so:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² - (2 hk cos30 + 2 hl cos30 + 2 kl cos30 )/(a² )

Substituting h=k=l=1:

1/d² = (3)/(100) - (2*(1+1+1)*cos30)/(100 )

= 3/100 - (6 * 0.866)/100 → 3/100 - 5.196/100.

Which is (3 -5.196)/100 →-2.196/100 →-0.02196.

Which is negative, which is impossible. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong formula. Maybe it's:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² ) + 2( hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a b c )

Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

(1/d²) = (h² (b c sin α)^2 + k² (a c sin β)^2 + l² (a b sin γ)^2 + ... )

But getting stuck again.

At this point, I think I've made a mistake in the formula, but can't find the right one. Since the options are around 9, and my initial calculation with a=10 gives 3.49, but that's not an option, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal of a multiplied by some factor.

Wait, considering that the interatomic distance is 10, and a=10, but the d-spacing is 10 divided by something. Maybe, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by a multiplied by the square root of (something).

Wait, if I compute a multiplied by sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) )=sqrt(3)=1.732, then 10*1.732=17.32. No, that's not matching.

Another approach: Perhaps the given interatomic distance is not along the edges but along face diagonals or body diagonals. Let's compute the body diagonal length.

In a cube, the body diagonal is a√3. But in a rhombohedral structure with angles 30°, the body diagonal would be longer.

Wait, the displacement vector is (1,1,1), so the distance is sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 )

= a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Which is a * sqrt(3 +5.196 )=a*sqrt(8.196)= a*2.863.

If the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10/2.863≈3.49.

Then, for the (111) plane, d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=3.49 / 2.863≈1.22 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 Angstrom, but I can't see how with the given formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct expression is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 +6 )=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.33 Angstrom. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(9)=30. No, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / (something), but I'm not getting anywhere.

I'm stuck. Given the options and my calculations, I think the correct answer should be approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I have made a wrong assumption about 'a' being 10.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between two (111) planes. No, that's the d-spacing itself.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing a key point. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at the options, the closest to the formula I'm using (but with a different a) is option C:9.54.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Suppose that the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and the formula for d-spacing is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos alpha ) )

If I take a=10, and we have:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866 )=10/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Angstrom.

But if I take a=10*sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63, then d=28.63/sqrt(8.196)=28.63/2.863≈10 Angstrom. So d=10.

But that's not possible because with a=28.63, the interatomic distance would be a=28.63, which is larger than the given 10.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:9.54 Angstrom, but I can't see the path to it. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula earlier.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Key Assumptions and Substitutions:
1. The interatomic distance is assumed to be the lattice parameter \( a \), so \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \).
2. For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \).
3. All angles are \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), so \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\).

### Calculation:
Substituting into the formula:
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:
\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866}
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

Now calculate \( d_{111} \):
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the given options, which are all in the range of 9–10 Å. This suggests either:
1. The interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter \( a \), but rather the nearest-neighbor distance in a different direction.
2. The formula used is incorrect for this specific case.

### Reassessing the Interatomic Distance:
If the interatomic distance corresponds to the diagonal of the unit cell, the distance along the (111) direction is:
\[
d = a \cdot \sqrt{3 + 6 \cos 30^\circ}
\]
\[
d = a \cdot \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = a \cdot \sqrt{8.196} \approx a \cdot 2.863
\]
Given \( d = 10 \, \text{Å} \), solve for \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

Now, recalculate \( d_{111} \) using this \( a \):
\[
d_{111} = \frac{3.49}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866}} = \frac{3.49}{2.863} \approx 1.22 \, \text{Å}
\]
This result is still inconsistent with the options.

### Conclusion:
Despite multiple approaches, the calculations do not yield a value close to the provided options. Based on the reasoning and the given options, the most plausible answer is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the exact derivation remains unclear.
