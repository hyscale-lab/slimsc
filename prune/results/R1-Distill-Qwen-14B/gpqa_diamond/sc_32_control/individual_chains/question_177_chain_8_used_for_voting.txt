Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars and how they compare. So, I remember that luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

Wait, the problem says that both stars have the same apparent brightness in terms of wavelengths. Oh, but wait, no—the question mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. Oh right, from Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if their peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

But wait, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and mass 1.5 times as well. But right now, mass doesn't seem directly relevant to the problem unless maybe it's a red herring or needed for another aspect. But the question is about luminosity, so perhaps focusing on radius and temperature is enough.

So, since T is the same for both, then luminosity depends on R squared. So L ~ R². Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same. So R1 is 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But T1=T2, so the T term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So why is the question giving different options?

Wait, but the question also mentions radial velocities. Oh, radial velocity is 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm. Wait, what's the impact of radial velocity on the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So their emitted wavelengths are different because of their velocities, but when observed, the peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The stars emit at their own peak wavelengths, but due to their motion, the observed wavelengths are different. But the astronomers found that the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps I need to correct the temperatures using the Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let's clarify. The stars emit at λ_emitted. But due to their radial velocity, the observed wavelength λ_observed is λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c). But wait, no, the exact Doppler shift formula is λ_obs / λ_em = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but that's for relativistic speeds, which I don't think applies here since velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. 700 km/s is about 0.0023c (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So non-relativistic approximation can be used.

In the non-relativistic case, the Doppler shift formula is approximately λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r/c). Wait, but for small velocities, maybe it's approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_em (1 + v_r/c). So if a star is moving towards us, v_r is negative (since moving towards), so the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). But in this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_obs1 is λ_em1 (since v_r=0). λ_obs2 is λ_em2 * (1 + 700e3 / c). Wait, but 700 km/s is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. Wait, the sign depends on the direction. Let's think: if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r/c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

Wait, but Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. Hmm, but the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs1 is λ_em1, and λ_obs2 is λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c). So:

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_em is proportional to 1/T. So λ_em1 = b / T1 and λ_em2 = b / T2. So:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

Wait, but wait, Star_2's v_r is 700 km/s. But is that moving away or towards us? Radial velocity is usually positive when moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, that would cause a redshift, so λ_obs2 is longer than λ_em2.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So for Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_em1 (since v_r1=0)
For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c) [but v_r2 is positive if moving away]

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r is negative. So if v_r is 700 km/s towards us, then λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 - 700e3/c). That would make λ_obs2 less than λ_em2. But given that Star_1's λ_obs is λ_em1, and we have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So let's write:

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

But wait, the problem states that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as emitted, λ_em1. Star_2's observed wavelength is λ_em2*(1 + v_r2/c). But the observed wavelengths are the same, so:

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

But from Wien's law, we know that λ_em = b / T. So:

λ_em1 = b / T1
λ_em2 = b / T2

Substituting into the equation:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c)

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter, so λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 - v_r2/c) (since v_r is positive when moving towards). But in our problem, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2. The problem says, "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The sign depends on the convention. Typically, radial velocity is positive when moving away. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that's moving away.

So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ λ_em2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = λ_em2 * (1 + 0.002333...) ≈ 1.002333 * λ_em2.

But since the observed wavelengths are the same, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_obs1 = λ_em1, we have:

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

But wait, let's think again. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. So the observed λ for Star_2 is longer than its emitted. But since the observed λ is the same as Star_1's, which is λ_em1, that would imply that λ_em1 is longer than λ_em2.

Hmm, but according to Wien's law, longer λ_em corresponds to lower temperature. So T1 < T2.

But earlier, I thought T1 = T2 because their observed λs were the same. But that was before considering Doppler shift. So now, considering the Doppler shift, T1 is not equal to T2.

Wait, so let me correct that: the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_em1 (since v_r1=0)

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c) = λ_em2 * (1 + 700e3/3e5) = λ_em2 * (1.002333...)

So since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * 1.002333...

But from Wien's law, λ_em = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.002333...

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333...

=> T1 = T2 / 1.002333...

So T1 is less than T2.

So T2 is higher than T1.

So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

We need to find the ratio L1/L2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) 

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know T1 = T2 / 1.002333...

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.002333...) ≈ T2 * (0.997674)

So,

(T1 / T2) = 0.997674

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997674)^4 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.997674^2 = approximately (1 - 0.002326)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002326) + (0.002326)^2 ≈ 0.995347 + 0.0000054 ≈ ~0.995352.

Then squared again: (0.995352)^2 ≈ 0.99072.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (0.997674)^4:

First calculate ln(0.997674) = approx -0.002333 (since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x). So ln(T1/T2) = ln(0.997674) ≈ -0.002333.

Multiply by 4: 4 * (-0.002333) = -0.009332.

Exp( -0.009332 ) ≈ 1 - 0.009332 + 0.009332^2/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.99074.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99074.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (approx 0.99074) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99074 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, so approximately 2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe the approximation can be made more accurately.

Compute (T1/T2) = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997674.

Compute T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.997674)^4.

Let me calculate 0.997674^2:

0.997674 * 0.997674.

= (1 - 0.002326)^2

≈ 1 - 2*0.002326 + 0.002326^2

= 1 - 0.004652 + 0.0000054

= 0.9953534.

Now, square that result again to get the fourth power.

0.9953534^2 = ?

Compute 0.9953534 * 0.9953534:

= (1 - 0.0046466)^2

≈ 1 - 2*0.0046466 + (0.0046466)^2

= 1 - 0.0092932 + 0.0000216

= 0.9907284.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.9907284.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907284 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990728 ≈ Let's compute this.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000728 ≈ 0.001638.

So total is approx 2.2275 + 0.001638 = 2.2291.

Which is approximately 2.23.

So the factor is about 2.23, which is option D.

To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Temperature**: The observed peak wavelengths of the stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the temperatures of the stars are related to their emitted wavelengths. However, the stars' radial velocities cause a Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelengths.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_{r1} = 0 \), so \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,1}} \).
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), moving away. Using the Doppler shift approximation for small velocities:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \right)
     \]
     where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \):
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \right) \approx \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot 1.002333
     \]
   - Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), we equate:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{em,1}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot 1.002333
     \]
   - From Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{em}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \)), the temperature ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997674
     \]
3. **Luminosity Ratio**: Substituting into the luminosity formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   - Since \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), \( R_1^2 = (1.5)^2 R_2^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \).
   - The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.997674)^4 \approx 0.990728
     \]
   - Combining these:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990728 \approx 2.227
     \]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
