Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, let me think through what I need to do. Alright, the question gives me the matrices for the operators Px, Py, and Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So here, A is Pz. So I'll need to find the expectation value of Pz and the expectation value of Pz squared, then take the square root of their difference.

First, I should write down the state vector. Let me denote it as |ψ⟩. So |ψ⟩ is a column vector with components [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check: the first element is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2.

Next, I need to find ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value of Pz. The operator Pz is given, right? Its matrix is [[ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ħ]]. So to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Let me write down ψ†. Since ψ is a column vector, ψ† will be a row vector with elements [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ψ† is [ -0.5 , (1/√2), -0.5 ].

Now, ψ† multiplied by Pz is a row vector times a matrix. Let's compute each element.

Hmm, let me compute Pz ψ first. Let's compute the product Pz |ψ⟩.

Pz is diagonal, so each component of Pz|ψ⟩ is Pz's diagonal element multiplied by the corresponding component of |ψ⟩.

So first component: ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2.

So Pz|ψ⟩ is the vector [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when you multiply a diagonal matrix by a vector, each component is scaled by the diagonal element.

So Pz|ψ⟩ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ħ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† Pz ψ is the inner product of ψ† and Pz|ψ⟩. So:

⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩ = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: ( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ/2 ) = (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * ( ħ/2 ) = - ( ħ/4 ).

So adding them up: ( ħ/4 ) + 0 + ( - ħ/4 ) = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of Pz is zero.

Now, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is the same as applying Pz twice, which would just square the diagonal elements.

Alternatively, since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is just the square of each diagonal element. So Pz squared matrix is [[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, (ħ)^2 ]].

So to compute ⟨Pz²⟩, I can compute ψ† Pz² ψ.

Alternatively, since Pz is diagonal, I can compute it component-wise.

Let me compute ψ† Pz² ψ. Since Pz² is diagonal, the product Pz² |ψ⟩ is [ (ħ)^2*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (ħ)^2*(-1/2) ]^T. Wait, wait no: wait, Pz² is [[ ħ², 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0, ħ² ]], so when you multiply by |ψ⟩, each component is multiplied by the diagonal element.

So Pz² |ψ⟩ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the third component of |ψ⟩ is -1/2, right? So third component of Pz² |ψ⟩ is ( -ħ )^2 * (-1/2) ? Wait no, Pz² is (Pz)^2, which is for each diagonal element, squared. So for the first component, Pz is ħ, so (Pz)^2 is ħ². Third component is -ħ, so (Pz)^2 is (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So Pz² |ψ⟩ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that would give [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Then, ψ† Pz² ψ is the inner product of ψ and Pz² |ψ⟩.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, the inner product is:

( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ²/2 ) + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ²/2 )

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2 ) = (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/√2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Adding them together: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Wait, but ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. So the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So that would be option B, which is ħ/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake in the matrix multiplication?

Another approach: since Pz is diagonal, the expectation of Pz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Let me think: the eigenstates of Pz are the basis vectors here. So |ψ⟩ can be written as a combination of these basis vectors.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in the Pz basis. So the components of |ψ⟩ are the coefficients in the expansion of the state in the Pz eigenbasis.

So for Pz, the eigenstates are |z=+ħ⟩, |z=0⟩, and |z=-ħ⟩. So |ψ⟩ is a combination of these. The first component is the amplitude for |z=+ħ⟩, the second for |z=0⟩, and the third for |z=-ħ⟩.

Wait, so |ψ⟩ is [a, b, c]^T, where a is coefficient for |+ħ⟩, c for |-ħ⟩, and b for |0⟩.

So the expectation value of Pz is a*(ħ) + b*(0) + c*(-ħ).

In our case, a is -1/2, c is -1/2. So expectation is (-1/2)(ħ) + (-1/2)(-ħ) = (-ħ/2) + (ħ/2) = 0. Which matches what I found earlier.

Similarly, ⟨Pz²⟩ is a²*(ħ²) + b²*(0) + c²*(ħ²). Because each eigenstate's square is their eigenvalue squared.

So a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So a² * ħ² is (1/4) ħ². Similarly, c is -1/2, so c² is 1/4; c² * ħ² is also (1/4) ħ². Adding them together gives (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So same as before.

Thus, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with matrix elements:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the coefficients of the eigenstates of $P_z$. The first component corresponds to the eigenvalue $+\hbar$, the second to $0$, and the third to $-\hbar$. Thus, the expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with matrix elements:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2(\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
