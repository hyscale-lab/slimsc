Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm. I remember that the mass dimension of the coupling constant tells us about the renormalizability. If the dimension is positive, the theory is renormalizable. Wait, isn't it that when the dimension is positive, that means the coupling has positive mass dimension, which implies that the interaction term is relevant, so the theory is renormalizable?

Wait, wait. Or is it that for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants should have non-negative mass dimensions? Or maybe the opposite. Let me think. The mass dimension of the coupling in a term like g φ^n should be considered. The Lagrangian terms must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, the general approach is: each term in the Lagrangian must have [Lagrangian term] = mass^4.

So for this interaction term, L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

First, I need to find the dimensions of each component in the term.

Breaking down each part:

1. ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2 in four dimensions. Because, for a Dirac field, the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So for the term to have dimension 4, ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ must have dimension 4. Let's compute:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, γ is dimensionless, ∂_μ is dimension 1. So each ψ contributes 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ each 3/2. So (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) * (3/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) times γ (dimensionless) times ∂_μ (dimension 1) times ψ (dimension 3/2). So the dimensions: 3/2 * (1) * (1) * (3/2) = (3/2)^2 *1 = 9/4, but that's not correct because the term must have dimension 4. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So the whole term is dimension 4. Each ψ̄ and ψ have dimension 3/2 each, and ∂_μ is dimension 1. So the product would be (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 1 is 4. Oh, right, because each derivative adds one. So yes, ψ̄ and ψ each have mass dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ has [ψ̄]_M = 3/2, and same for ψ.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. But when you have a commutator of two gamma matrices, that's dimensionless because the gammas are dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} psi would have dimension [ψ̄] + [σ] + [psi] = 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. Let me think about that. For a gauge field, like in electromagnetism, the field strength F_{mu nu} has dimension 2. Because the Maxwell Lagrangian term is F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 4 (since each F is dimension 2). So F^{mu nu} here would have dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the interaction term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ F ψ), which has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] ?

Wait, no. Let me re-express the term: κ * (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) * F^{mu nu}.

Wait, because σ_{mu nu} is a tensor, and F^{mu nu} is another tensor, but in the term, it's ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me clarify: the term is (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) multiplied by F^{mu nu}. So the entire part inside is (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the product of ψ̄ σ ψ and F.

Wait, but the structure is (ψ̄ σ^{mu nu} ψ) * F_{mu nu} or similar? Wait, the index contraction is probably over mu and nu, so each sigma and F have two indices, but when you contract them, their dimensions still add. Because sigma has dimension 0, F has dimension 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) has dimension 3 (as before), and F has dimension 2. So the entire term (ψ̄ σ ψ) F is 3 +2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F), and this must have dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4.

Compute [ψ̄ σ ψ F]:

[ψ̄] = 3/2, [σ] = 0, [ψ] =3/2, [F]=2.

So sum: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 +2 =5.

So the term [κ] *5 must equal 4.

So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the dimension of kappa is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. The rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension >=0. Because in perturbation theory, each coupling with positive dimension can be considered as a relevant operator, so the theory can be renormalized.

Wait, but wait. If the coupling has negative dimension, it's an irrelevant operator, and the theory is non-renormalizable. So here, [κ]_M =-1, which is negative. So the interaction term is irrelevant, implying the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait! Wait a moment. Wait, is this a gauge interaction or something else? Because sometimes you can have higher-dimensional operators, but in the case of gauge theories, there's more structure.

Wait, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. That looks like a term that could come from a higher-dimensional operator. For example, in QED, the interaction is e ψ̄ γ^μ ψ A_mu, which has dimension 4 because e is dimensionless (in 4D). But in this case, the interaction term is dimension 5 (as we found earlier), so the coupling has negative dimension.

So let me recap: each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term given has dimension 5, so the coupling must have dimension -1 to make the total dimension 4.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

As for renormalizability, since the coupling has dimension -1, which is negative, this would imply that the theory is non-renormalizable. Because in a renormalizable theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension <=4, and the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. So any term with a coupling of negative dimension would make the theory non-renormalizable.

So the options given are:

A) [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable.

No, because if [κ]=-1, the theory is non-renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, [κ] is -1, so B is incorrect.

C) [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Yes, this matches our conclusion.

D) [κ]=1, theory not renormalizable.

No, because [κ] is -1.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\), and \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of each field
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([ F ]_M = 2\).
- The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless, so \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\). Breaking it down:
- The spinor fields contribute \([ \bar{\psi} ]_M + [ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3\).
- The field strength tensor contributes \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).
- The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless, so it does not affect the total dimension.

Thus, the total dimension of the interaction term is:
\[
[ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (to ensure the action is dimensionless), the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must satisfy:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimension of the interaction term:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is irrelevant, and the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\).
- **Option C**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\).
