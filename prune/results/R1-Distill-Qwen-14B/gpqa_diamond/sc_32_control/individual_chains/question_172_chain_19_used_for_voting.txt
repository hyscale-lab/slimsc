Okay, I need to figure out this star question. So, the problem is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, the excitation of atoms relates to temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the number of excited atoms in star 1 is higher. Oh wait, no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So N1 = 2 * N2, maybe?

Right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The population of an energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-E/(k*T)). So the ratio of the populations of two levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but in this case, it's the same energy level in both stars? Or is it different? The problem states the energy difference between the considered energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Oh, so each star has two energy levels, perhaps, but with the same energy difference. So for each star, the excitation is in the sameΔE.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy between the levels is ΔE. But wait, star_1 has twice as excited in the specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that level for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Wait, but the problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So, the population of that energy level is higher, which is N1 = 2 * N2.

But wait, in LTE, the excitation is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio between the populations of two energy states is given by (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). In this case, I think E_i is the higher energy level.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the excited state (n) to the ground state (or another lower state) is given by Boltzmann. But wait, the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so ΔE is same for both.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J between the levels considered. So for both stars, the same ΔE is used.

Let me think. For each star, the number of excited atoms in level i is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is the star's temperature.

So for star_1: n1 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: n2 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but why A? Because the total number of atoms would be a factor, but the ratio is what matters here.

Wait the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

So substituting the expressions:

A * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * [ A * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

A cancels out.

So: exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's take natural logarithm on both sides.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, that can be rearranged.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because [ (-1/T1) + (1/T2) ) ] is same as (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Alternatively, [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2) / (ΔE/(k) )

Wait, but wait... let me double-check.

Wait, let me re-express the equation:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) * (ΔE / k) ) = ln(2)

Wait, which can be rearranged as:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Hmm. But the problem gives us ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant k, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, wait a minute!

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Which is equal to k_B (Boltzmann constant), since k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is equal to k_B.

So substituting ΔE = k into our equation:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE = [ ln(2) * k ] / k = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k_B \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the population of an energy level is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. For star_1 and star_2, the populations of the excited energy level are proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / (k_B T_1)) \) and \( \exp(-\Delta E / (k_B T_2)) \), respectively. Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k_B \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k_B \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
