Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh, and c is given as 1, which I guess is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me recall what I know about this. So, when light moves through a medium, its speed is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed in the medium. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be v_light = c/n. But now the glass is moving, which complicates things.

I remember something about the addition of velocities in relativity, but wait, this is about light in a medium. Oh right, because the medium itself is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame might change. But wait, Einstein's theory says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, it's not a vacuum; it's a medium with index n.

Hmm, I think in this case, the speed of light in the medium depends on the frame. So when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light might not just be c/n anymore. But how?

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed observed from a lab frame can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but the formula for velocity addition is when you have velocities u and v, and you want the speed in the new frame. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, that's when you have a source moving at speed u and the observer moving at speed v. Or am I mixing up the frames?

Wait, no. The standard velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. So in this case, the light is moving at v_light_medium = c/n in the medium's frame. But the medium itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab frame, the velocity of the light would be (v_light_medium + v)/(1 + (v_light_medium * v)/c²).

Wait, but wait a second. The medium's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's velocity in the lab would be the velocity in the medium's frame plus the medium's velocity, adjusted by the relativistic addition formula.

Let me write that down:

u_medium = v (the speed of the medium relative to lab)
u_light_in_medium = c/n (since in the medium, the speed is c/n)

So the observed speed u_light in lab would be (u_medium + u_light_in_medium) / (1 + (u_medium * u_light_in_medium)/c² )

Plugging in the values:

u_light = [v + (c/n)] / [1 + (v * (c/n))/c² ]

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator becomes 1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) = 1 + (v)/(n c )

Wait, but since c=1, as per the problem, that's a big simplification. So let's substitute c=1:

Numerator: v + (1/n)
Denominator: 1 + (v)/(n * 1) ) = 1 + v/(n)

So the entire expression becomes [v + 1/n ] / [1 + v/(n) ]

Let me factor that. Let's see:

Numerator: (n v + 1)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So when you divide them, the n's cancel:

[(n v + 1)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (n v +1) / (n +v )

So the speed is (n v +1)/(n + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is the same as (n v +1)/(n +v ) because addition is commutative. So option A is correct.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think if I applied the formula correctly. Because sometimes, when the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion, the effect might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity addition is more complicated.

Wait, another thought: the velocity addition formula applies to objects with their own velocity in the medium. But in this case, the light is propagating through the moving medium. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the medium is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab measures the light's speed as u = (u_medium + u_light_medium) / [1 + (u_medium u_light_medium)/c² ]

Yes, that's what I did earlier. So the result is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

Alternatively, another approach: consider the refractive index. The index n is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium at rest. But when the medium is moving, the refractive index observed might change. But I'm not sure about that approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Doppler effect or something else. But I think the first approach with velocity addition is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the moving glass medium relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the medium's rest frame is \( v_{\text{light, medium}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Since the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame is given by:

\[
u_{\text{light}} = \frac{u_{\text{medium}} + u_{\text{light, medium}}}{1 + \frac{u_{\text{medium}} \cdot u_{\text{light, medium}}}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u_{\text{medium}} = v \) (the velocity of the glass relative to the lab) and \( u_{\text{light, medium}} = \frac{1}{n} \) (the speed of light in the medium, since \( c = 1 \) in this problem). Substituting these values:

\[
u_{\text{light}} = \frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + \frac{v \cdot \frac{1}{n}}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u_{\text{light}} = \frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:

\[
u_{\text{light}} = \frac{n v + 1}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
