Okay, I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. So, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension is important for renormalizability. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field and the coupling constant κ. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimensions that allow the interaction term to be renormalizable, which usually means their dimension is ≥ 0. Wait, or is it that each term must have a dimension that's equal to or less than 4? Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, the Lagrangian is an interaction term, so each term in the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4. Let me break down the term L_int. 

The term is κ times ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}. Let me write down each field's dimension. 

I think the fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, Dirac fields have dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2. 

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since γ matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} must have the same dimension as the field strength F, which is the antisymmetric combination of derivatives. 

What's the dimension of F^{μν}? F is made from the field strength tensor, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1 (since it's ∂/∂x^μ, and x has dimension -1 in mass units). So each derivative brings a dimension of 1. The field A is a vector field, so it has dimension 1 (since gauge fields like photons in electromagnetism have dimension 1). So F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ: each term is [∂][A] = 1*1 = 1. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, more accurately, each term in F is ∂μ Aν. So each A has dimension 1, each derivative is dimension 1, so F has dimension 1+1=2. 

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's compute the dimensions:

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices and derivatives? Wait, no: σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, and the commutator. So σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices, which are just constants, so it's actually a product of gamma matrices and maybe some derivatives? Wait, no: the sigma is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ F would have the dimensions: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 * 2 = 3, plus 2 is 5. But wait, the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the entire term L_int has to have dimension 4. So let me compute the dimensions:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5. 

This must equal 4 because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait. I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each ψ is 3/2, σ is dimensionless, F is 2. So adding them: 3/2 + 0 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5. So the term would have dimension 5, but Lagrangian terms must be dimension 4. So to make the entire term dimension 4, κ must have dimension -1. Because κ multiplied by something of dimension 5 equals 4. So κ must have [κ] = 4 -5= -1.

So that's the mass dimension of κ. Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. In general, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if each coupling has mass dimension ≤ (4 - dimension of the term). Wait, I might be a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because higher dimension couplings would lead to higher-order divergences that can't be absorbed by the original terms.

Wait, more accurately, in 4 dimensions, each coupling in the interaction term must have a mass dimension ≤ 0. Because each term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. Suppose the term is L = g φ^n. Then [g] = 4 - n*(mass dimension of φ). For renormalizability, the dimension of g must be ≥0, so 4 - n [φ] ≥0. So perhaps in this case, if [κ] is negative, which is -1, that would imply that the term is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension.

Wait, [κ] is -1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling constant has negative mass dimension, which means the interaction is of higher order and the theory is non-renormalizable.

Let me think again. The term is a dimension 4 term. The coupling κ has dimension -1. So the term is dimensionless? Wait, L has to have dimension 4 (since it's part of the Lagrangian density). So if the coupling has dimension -1, then the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = (-1) +3/2 +0 +3/2 +2 → (-1) +3 +2 =4. So yes, that adds up. But the fact that κ has negative dimension (so it's like an inverse mass scale) implies that the interaction is relevant or irrelevant? Negative dimension implies that it's an irrelevant coupling, but that might not be the right way to think.

Wait, in terms of renormalization, the superficial degree of divergence can be determined. For a Feynman diagram, the superficial degree is D = 4 - (sum of external legs' dimensions) + (number of vertices)*(coupling's dimension). Each vertex contributes a factor of [coupling]. So for each vertex, since [κ]=-1, each vertex contributes -1. 

But maybe that's more complicated. Another approach: the theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have dimensions ≤ 4 - (n), where n is the number of fields in the term. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the mass dimension of the term. 

In any case, another perspective: the interaction term is of the form ψ̄ γσ F ψ. The dimension of the term is 4. The coupling is κ, which we found has dimension -1. So for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the interaction non-renormalizable. 

Therefore, since κ has [κ]=-1, which is <0, the term is of higher dimension. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options: option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable. So the correct option should be C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. Consequently, $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, so $[\partial_\mu]_M = 1$ and $[A_\mu]_M = 1$. Thus, $F^{\mu\nu}$ has $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The object $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Therefore, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The interaction term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The dimension of the term is given by:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions of the fields:
\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
