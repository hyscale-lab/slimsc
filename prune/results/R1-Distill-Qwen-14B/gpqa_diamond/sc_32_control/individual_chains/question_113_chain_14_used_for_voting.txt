Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and three characterization techniques were used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given data and choose between the options A to D.

Let me list out the observations from each technique:

1. FTIR:
   - Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in this region are usually due to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might indicate hydrogen bonding. Carboxylic acids typically have broad O-H stretches because they can form strong hydrogen bonds. Alcohols usually have less broad peaks, but it depends on the solvent and concentration. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group like in a phenol? Phenols have broad O-H stretches as well.

   - Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, another thought: 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some electron withdrawal groups, or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Alternatively, maybe an ester or amide? No, wait, ester carbonyls are around 1740-1700. If the main carbonyl is at 1700, that's probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be something else. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch. For example, in a benzene ring, the stretching is around 1450-1600, so 1650 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ketone. Or perhaps an ester where the carbonyl is at 1700, and another peak is from a C=C in an ester group, but I'm not sure.

2. 1H NMR:
   - Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, maybe an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. If it's an aromatic ring, the H NMR would show signals in the aromatic region, like 6.5-8.5 ppm. But the question mentions vinyl hydrogens, which could mean either alkenes or aromatic.

3. Mass Spectrometry:
   - Fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. The molecular ion peak would give the molecular weight. The options are formulas with different molecular weights. Let me compute the molecular weights of each option:

   Option A: C6H12O2. The formula is C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72+12+32=116 g/mol.

   Option B: C6H10O. (6×12)+(10×1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

   Option C: C6H10O2. (6×12)+(10×1)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

   Option D: C6H12O. (6×12)+(12×1)+(16)=72+12+16=100.

   Wait, but the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. So what fragment could give a mass of 45? Let's think about possible fragments.

   45 could be a common fragment. For example, the methyl group is 15, but that's too low. Maybe a CH3CO+ (molecular weight 43) isn't 45. Alternatively, maybe a CO (28) plus something? Wait, 45 is 3×15 (for CH3 groups?), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps CH3COO- is 60, but that's not it. Oh wait! The CH3CO (acetate) group is 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or some other structure.

   Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group or something else. Hmm. Another angle: the molecular formula of the compound. Let me think about the possible structures.

   Let's consider the FTIR again. The peaks at 1700 and 1650. If 1700 is a carbonyl (C=O), and 1650 is a conjugated double bond. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond. For instance, an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, like a ketone with a conjugated double bond. That would explain the peaks at 1700 (C=O) and around 1650 (C=C in conjugation with the carbonyl). Alternatively, maybe an ester group, but in that case, the C=O would be higher, around 1740.

   Wait, wait. If the main carbonyl is around 1700, that's more typical of a ketone or an aldehyde. Esters are usually higher, around 1740. So perhaps it's a ketone. If 1650 is a C=C stretch, that would support an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone structure. Such as a cyclic structure, like cyclohexenone or something more substituted.

   Alternatively, 1650 could be a carbonyl from another group. Wait, but 1650 is lower than 1700, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, such as in an acid chloride, but that's probably too high.

   Now, about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests double bonds. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ring with substituents that cause splitting. For example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an ester or something. Alternatively, a non-aromatic compound with an alkene and a carbonyl.

   Now, combining all the info: the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 (probably O-H), a carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (maybe a conjugated double bond). The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so double bond protons. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

   Let me think about possible structures. Let's hypothesize that the compound is a carboxylic acid. Then, it would have a broad O-H stretch. The 1700 could be the carbonyl. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H and C=O. But their C=O is usually a bit lower than esters but higher than ketones. Wait, no, for carboxylic acids, the C=O is around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. So 1700 is possible. Then, why is there a peak at 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring's ring vibrations, or conjugated double bonds.

   Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the O-H peak at 3000 would not be present, unless it's an acidic ester. Wait, but the broad peak suggests an -OH group, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, the presence of an ester would imply another O, but maybe that's part of the formula.

   Let's think about the options. The options are four different formulas. So let me see:

   Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. Hmm.

   Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

   Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So same as B, two degrees.

   Option D: C6H12O. (12+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

   The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so at least one degree). The IR has a C=O, which is another degree. So maybe two degrees of unsaturation. Let me see which options have two degrees:

   Options B and C have two degrees. So either could fit. 

   Now, the IR has a broad peak, so O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. Which options have O in the formula? All except maybe but let's see. Oh, all options have O except none, but the options are all with O.

   Wait, option D is C6H12O. That would have one O. So, possible functional groups like an alcohol or an ether. But the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which would suggest an -OH (like an alcohol or phenol) or maybe an amine (-NH), but the question says it's FTIR, so amines have N-H stretches which might show up around 3300-3500 as a broad peak. But the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower, more likely an O-H.

   So, the compound has an O-H group. So, for the options, which have O in the formula. All options except perhaps some, but in the given options, all have O except maybe no, all have O.

   Wait, let's check each option:

   Option A: C6H12O2. Two O's. Could be a carboxylic acid (COOH) or an ester (COOR) or a ketone with an alcohol.

   Option B: C6H10O. One O. Could be an alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, or maybe an ester, but with only one O, maybe an aldehyde or ketone plus an alcohol? Not likely.

   Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Could be a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, but that would be two O's. Alternatively, an ester and a double bond.

   Option D: C6H12O. One O. Could be an alcohol or an ether or a ketone.

   Now, considering all the data, we have O-H, a carbonyl, and a conjugated double bond (if the 1650 is C=C). Let's think about possible structures.

   If it's a carboxylic acid (like benzoic acid), then the formula would have two O's (from COOH). But for C6H12O2, how? Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. So maybe a substituted version?

   Alternatively, perhaps an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R', which would have two O's. So the molecular formula would have two O's. For example, methyl benzoate is C8H8O2, but our options are C6H12O2, which is a different size.

   Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But that would require an oxygen in the ring, but I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene or an aromatic ring. If it's an aromatic ring, the NMR would show multiple peaks in the aromatic region. But the question says "peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens," so perhaps it's an alkene. So maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexene with a substituent.

   Let me think about the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. So what fragments could give that? The molecular ion would be the molecular weight. So the molecular weight is the sum of the formula.

   Let me calculate the molecular weights again:

   A) C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. 72+12+32=116.

   B) C6H10O: 72 +10=82 +16=98.

   C) C6H10O2: 72 +10=82 +32=114.

   D) C6H12O: 72 +12=84 +16=100.

   The fragment is at 45. So in the molecular ion, when the molecule breaks apart, a fragment with a mass of 45 is formed. Let's think about what could have a mass of 45. 

   45 is 3×15, but more importantly, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (58? Wait, no, acetone is (propan-2-one): C3H6O, which is 58. Hmm, that's not right. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3COOH? No, that's 60. Or maybe a smaller fragment.

   Alternatively, 45 could be CH3COO- (43), but that's 43, not 45. Wait, maybe a different group. Let's see: 45 is 45 g/mol. So that's 45=12a +1b +16c. Let's see possible combinations:

   Maybe C3H3O: (3×12)+(3×1)+(16) = 36+3+16=55. No.

   What about C3H7O? 3×12=36 +7×1=7 +16=16 → 36+7+16=59.

   Hmm. Maybe C2H5NO? No, probably not. Or perhaps a fragment that's something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH2O group. CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. No.

   Alternatively, think about the molecular formula. Let's assume the molecular weight is around 100-116. The fragment could be a smaller part. Let me think about the possible structures.

   Suppose the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a 5-membered ring, but that's C4H6O2. Our options are C6H10O2 or similar.

   Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester or something else.

   Another approach: in mass spectrometry, the most prominent fragments can give clues. For example, in esters, a common fragment is the loss of the R group, leaving the ester oxygen and the other part. Alternatively, the fragment at m/z=45 could be a common group. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58, so that's not it). Alternatively, 45 could be something like CH3COO- but that's 43. Hmm. Maybe a different approach.

   Alternatively, think about the possible structures that have a carbonyl and a double bond. Let's say the structure is something like cyclohexenone. Cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Its molecular formula is C6H10O. So option B is C6H10O. Let's see if that fits.

   So, cyclohexenone: the IR would show a C=O around 1700, and the double bond would have a C=C around maybe 1650, but wait, cyclohexenone's double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl, so its C=C would be around 1640-1660 cm⁻¹. So that would fit the 1650 peak.

   The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ would be problematic because cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH group. So the FTIR would not show a broad peak at 3000. So that suggests that the structure has an -OH group.

   Hmm. So perhaps the compound is a dihydroxy ketone, like a cyclohexanone with an -OH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic compound with a conjugated carbonyl.

   Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. But benzaldehyde doesn't have an -OH group.

   Alternatively, think about an ester with an -OH group. For example, a methyl salicylate or something similar. Salicylic acid has an -OH and an ester group. But let me think: salicylic acid is O-hydroxybenzoic acid. If it's an ester, like methyl salicylate, the structure would be OCH3 and COOCH3. But that would require two O's, so the formula would be C8H8O3, but our options are smaller.

   Maybe a substituted cyclohexanol with a ketone group. But then the formula would have more than two O's. Hmm.

   Let me think again about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens: perhaps the structure has an alkene group. So maybe it's something like an allyl alcohol. Allyl alcohol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Its formula is C3H6O. But our options are larger.

   Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic compound with an -OH group and a double bond. For example, cyclopentenol. But the formula would vary based on substitution.

   Let me try to approach this with the mass spec fragment. If m/z=45 is a fragment, perhaps it's a CH3CO group. Wait, CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12+12 +16=40? Wait, CH3CO is (CH3)₂CO? No, wait, CH3CO is the acetyl group, which is C2H3O. Its molecular weight is 2*12 + 3*1 +16=24+3+16=43. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45. Close but not exactly.

   Another idea: maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O something. Wait, 45 is 9×5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, think of a fragment like CH2CH(OH)CO something. Not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has a side chain that breaks off. For example, if the compound is something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

   Let me try another angle. The molecular formula must have an -OH group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens and IR). So possible structures could include:

   1. An acid (RCOOH): but then the O count would be two. So option A or C.

   2. An ester (RCOOR'): but that would require two O's as well.

   3. A ketone with an -OH group: which would be possible in option B (C6H10O) or D (C6H12O).

   Wait, option B is C6H10O. So that would have one O. If it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two O's. So that's not possible. So perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but that's getting complicated.

   Maybe the structure has both an ester and an -OH group, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

   Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an -OH substituent. For example, cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group. Let's say the structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-one with an -OH. Wait, but that would have the formula C6H8O2: because cyclohexenone is C6H10O, adding an -OH would make it C6H10O2. Wait, no. Let me count: cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Adding an -OH would increase O by one, but H by one? Because replacing a H with OH adds an O and a H. So initial formula is C6H10O. Adding an OH group would change to C6H11O2. But our options don't have C6H11O2. So that's not matching.

   Alternatively, maybe the structure has an ester group and another functional group. Let me think about the options again.

   Option C is C6H10O2. So two O's. So possible structures could be a diester, but that would require more O's. Or an ester and an alcohol, but that would require three O's. Alternatively, an ester and a carbonyl group. Wait, an ester has a carbonyl already.

   Wait, the IR shows two carbonyl peaks? No, IR shows 1700 and 1650. Maybe two different carbonyl groups. But that's less likely. More probably, 1700 is the carbonyl, 1650 is another functional group, perhaps an aromatic ring.

   Let me think about the NMR. Vinyl hydrogens usually appear in the range of about 4.5-7 ppm, depending on substitution. If the structure has an aromatic ring, the H's would be in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range. But the question says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl H's, which could also be from an aromatic ring, but perhaps the structure is not aromatic but has a regular double bond.

   Another approach: the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H), a peak at 1700 (C=O), and 1650 could be a C=C. So possible structures:

   An alpha, beta-unsaturated ester? Or perhaps a beta-keto ester.

   Wait, but the O count. Let me think about a possible structure.

   Suppose the structure is a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a 5-membered ring, but with more carbons. Let's say it's a six-membered ring, perhaps with an ester linkage. So the structure would be something like an ester with a ring. But then the O count would be two: one from the ester oxygen and perhaps another from somewhere else. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. These are known as geminal diols, but they tautomerize into enols. Wait, but that would require an H adjacent to the carbonyl. But the presence of an O-H group would suggest an enol form. Or, perhaps, it's a beta-hydroxy ketone. So the structure would have an -OH and a ketone group, along with a double bond.

   Let me think about the molecular formula. If the structure has a carbonyl, a double bond, and an -OH, what would the formula be? Let's say the structure is something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-R.

   But I'm not sure about that.

   Let me go back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let me think of possible groups:

   45 = 45. Let's see if any common groups match that. For example, the acetate ion is 43 (CH3COO⁻), but that's 43. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group. Wait, CH2CH2O has a molecular weight of 44 (24 + 2 +16=42? No, 2 carbons are 24, 4 H's are 4, 16 O: 24+4+16=44. No, 44. Not 45.

   Another possibility: the fragment is a CH2CH(OH) group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O with a substituent.

   Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the molecular ion is broken into a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has a molecular weight of 114. So, if the molecule breaks off a fragment of 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. So, perhaps the molecule is a combination of a 45 fragment and a 69 fragment.

   But I'm not sure what that would imply structurally.

   Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

   Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, carboxylic acids, lactones. Maybe a diol with a ketone. But how?

   Option B: C6H10O. Could be an aromatic alcohol? But without an -O- group, perhaps a phenol or an aliphatic alcohol with a double bond.

   Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Or a diol with a carbonyl group.

   Option D: C6H12O. Could be an alcohol with a ring or a double bond.

   Let's think about the FTIR. The broad peak suggests an -OH group. So the compound is either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid. The two carbonyl peaks: one at 1700 and another at 1650. Assuming 1700 is a carbonyl, 1650 could be a conjugated double bond.

   If the structure is a dihydroxy ketone, which would have an -OH and a ketone. But that would require two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A), depending on the structure.

   Alternatively, a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's more complex.

   Let me think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl H's suggests a double bond. So perhaps the structure has a conjugated enol form, which would have both an -OH and a double bond. So, for example, a cyclohexenone with an -OH group.

   Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. If it has an additional -OH, the formula becomes C6H10O2 (option C), which has two O's.

   So, structure like cyclohex-2-en-1-one-5-ol. So, cyclohexenone with an -OH group.

   Let's see if that fits all the data.

   IR: The O-H stretch would be broad around 3000, the carbonyl at 1700, and the C=C at 1650. That fits.

   NMR: The vinyl H's would be the protons on the double bond. Depending on the substitution, those would appear in the 4.5-6 ppm range. So that fits.

   Mass spec: The molecular weight would be 114 (C6H10O2). A fragment at 45 could come from a part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule breaks into a CH3COO- group (43) plus another fragment, but that's 43, not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a (CH2)3 group or something else.

   Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. Wait, that's 44, not 45. Hmm.

   Another possibility: the fragment at 45 is from a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, CH3O has a molecular weight of 31, but that's not 45.

   Alternatively, the fragment could be a benzene ring with something, but the options don't include benzene rings (as they have 6 carbons, but benzene itself is C6H6, but the options have more H's?).

   Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is 45, then the remaining would be 114-45=69. 69 could be a fragment like C5H10O or similar, but I'm not sure.

   Another approach: think about what the molecular formula would be if the fragment is at 45.

   If the fragment is 45, and the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (114), then 114-45=69. So the molecule could have a part that weighs 45 and another that's 69. Not sure if that helps.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is such that a common fragment like CH3COOH (60) is part of it. But 60 is higher than 45, so that's not matching.

   Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the data, the presence of O-H, a carbonyl, and a conjugated double bond suggests that the compound has two O's and two degrees of unsaturation. So the options with two O's are A, C.

   The degrees of unsaturation: for the structure to have a carbonyl (one), a double bond (another), and an -OH (no addition), that makes two degrees. So options with two degrees are B and C.

   Option B has C6H10O (two degrees), but only one O. So the structure would require an -OH and a carbonyl, which would need two O's, so option B can't be correct. Therefore, it must be option C: C6H10O2.

   Now, the mass spec fragment of 45: perhaps it's from a CH3COO group (43), but that would be 43, not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a different part of the molecule, like a CH2CH2O group, which is 44. Not matching exactly, but perhaps the exact value depends on the structure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2OCH3 group, but that's probably not right. Hmm.

   Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

   Option C: C6H10O2. Let me think of a structure with a carbonyl, a double bond, and an -OH group. For example, a cyclic structure like cyclopentenone with an -OH substituent. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but that's four carbons. Our compound has six carbons.

   Another idea: perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexenone with an ester group. But that would require more O's.

   Alternatively, maybe it's a diester, but that might require more O's.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an ester group. But again, O counts.

   Let me think about a specific example. Let's say the structure is a gamma-keto ester. For example, something like CH2CH2CO-O-R. Wait, but I'm not certain.

   Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond.

   I'm not entirely confident, but based on the O-H, two carbonyl peaks, and double bond, I think option C is the correct formula.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The following observations were made:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an -OH group (likely from an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid).  
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - Another strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹, which could correspond to a conjugated double bond (C=C) or an aromatic ring vibration.  

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond (either alkenyl or aromatic).  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45, suggesting a common fragment with a molecular weight of 45.  

### Analysis of the Options:
#### Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂  
- Molecular weight = 116 g/mol.  
- Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).  
- This formula could correspond to a compound with a carbonyl group and an -OH group, but it lacks sufficient degrees of unsaturation to account for the observed vinyl hydrogens and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak (likely requiring an additional double bond).  

#### Option B: C₆H₁₀O  
- Molecular weight = 98 g/mol.  
- Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).  
- This formula has only one oxygen, which is insufficient to account for the observed -OH group and the carbonyl group.  

#### Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂  
- Molecular weight = 114 g/mol.  
- Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).  
- This formula has two oxygens, consistent with the presence of an -OH group and a carbonyl group. The degrees of unsaturation align with the observed vinyl hydrogens and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak, suggesting a conjugated system (e.g., an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester).  

#### Option D: C₆H₁₂O  
- Molecular weight = 100 g/mol.  
- Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).  
- This formula has only one oxygen, which is insufficient to account for the observed -OH group and the carbonyl group.  

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygens to satisfy the -OH and carbonyl groups, as well as two degrees of unsaturation to account for the vinyl hydrogens and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak. Based on this analysis, the most likely chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.  

Answer: C
