Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but I think that might not matter much here.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers would choose the one with higher probability. The options give different ratios, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), or wait, no, I think it's more about the orbital alignment. Oh right, the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so the probability simplifies because the term becomes 1. So P = (R_p / R_s)^2, but wait, wait. No, I think I might be mixing it up.

Wait, actually, the transit probability P for a planet is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2)) + ... Hmm, maybe I should think differently. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for the transit. Oh right, the geometric probability. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (R_s + R_p) / a ]? Wait, no, I think it's P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s + R_p))) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me recall.

Another approach: The transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The probability P is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the planet's orbit is around the star, the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is based on the star's size relative to the orbit. So the transit probability P is approximately (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the likelihood that the orbital inclination is right. 

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 ))^(1/2), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. 

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s + R_p)) )^2? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of it geometrically. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit (a is the semi-major axis, but since it's circular, a is the radius). So the chance that the planet passes in front of the star is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, because we're looking for the fraction of the orbit where the planet would block our view. Wait, no, that's not quite correct because it's the solid angle. The probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, I recall that the probability is [ (R_p + R_s) / a ]^2 multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, no, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination allows a transit. The inclination for a transit is when the planet's orbit is edge-on, which is a specific condition. The probability of this, assuming randomly distributed inclinations, is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit. 

Wait, actually, here's a better approach. The probability P that a planet transits is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (R_s + R_p) / a ]^2. Or wait, no. Let me get this straight. The probability is the ratio of the area of the circle (from which a transit is possible) to the area of the orbit.

Wait, perhaps a simpler way is to think that the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find the formula. From what I remember, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a )^2 )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s + R_p)) ) )^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the Hill sphere or the area where the planet could transit. Alternatively, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2) ) ).

I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, so maybe I should think about the factors that influence the transit probability. The probability increases with a smaller star (since R_s is smaller, R_p/R_s is larger) and a smaller orbital distance a (since a smaller a makes R_s/a larger, but wait, smaller a would mean that the planet is closer, so the chances of alignment would be higher? Or lower? Hmm.)

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the transit probability. Since I can't actually look it up right now, I'll have to rely on memory. Let me recall: the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) ), but only when a > R_s, which it always is. Wait, no, I think that's for the depth of the transit, not the probability. Alternatively, the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 / (a / (R_s + R_p)) )^2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the transit probability as the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the distance from Earth, but that doesn't make sense because that's not given here. Alternatively, the probability is determined by the orbital inclination and the size of the star relative to the orbit.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is simply (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbit is edge-on enough. The probability that the orbit is edge-on is (R_s / a), since the critical angle for a transit is when the inclination is such that the planet's orbit's distance is equal to R_s. So, the probability for the orbit to be edge-on enough is (R_s / a) * 2 (since it's a circle, from both sides), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the probability that the planet transits is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), because R_s is the 'height' from the edge of the star, and a is the orbital radius. So, the probability depends on the ratio of these factors.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) ). Hmm, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, let me think about the transit probability as the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbital path as seen from Earth. But actually, the transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet would pass in front of the star. So, the area of the circle where the planet can transit is the area of the star's disk, but the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. So, the probability is (R_s / a)^2, but that's only part of it. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, which is a small part of the orbit.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (4 a^2) ) * (1 - (R_s / a) cos i ), but inclination i comes into play. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_s / (2 a))^2. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, I think I should look for the formula. From what I remember, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )) )

Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s/a)^2 ))^0.5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the probability that a planet transits is the fraction of its orbit that would pass in front of the star, considering the relative sizes. So, the area where the planet can transit is the area of the star, and the area of the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. So, the probability is (R_s / a)^2. But that's just the geometric probability based on area.

But wait, wait, no. Because the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, and the star is much smaller. The probability that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is higher when a is smaller and R_s is larger. So, P = (R_s / a)^2. But wait, that would mean that if a is small, the probability is higher. Let me think.

But wait, no, because when a is smaller (planet is closer to the star), the orbit is smaller, so the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is higher. So, higher probability when a is smaller. So, in our case, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, which implies it's closer to its star. So, Planet_1 has a smaller a than Planet_2. So, if the transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, then Planet_1 would have a higher probability.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the planet and the star. So, the formula I think is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 / a) )

Wait, no, perhaps not. I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transit probability as the product of two factors: the geometric probability that the orbit is edge-on enough, and the chance that the planet's size is sufficient to cause a detectable transit.

The geometric probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned correctly (i.e., edge-on) is given by (R_s / a)^2. Because the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_s, and the total possible area is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (R_s / a)^2.

Then, the transit depth depends on (R_p / R_s)^2, but the question is about the probability of a transit occurring, not the depth. So, the overall transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because (R_p/R_s)^2 is the depth, but the probability of the alignment is (R_s/a)^2. So, P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a^2). So, P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2.

Wait, but that would mean that the probability depends on the planet's radius and the orbital distance. So, if a planet is larger and closer, it's more probable to transit.

But in our case, both planets have the same mass. Since we're talking about Earth-like planets, their radii would be similar, but perhaps not exactly the same. But wait, the question says both have Earth-like planets, but their masses are the same, so perhaps R_p is the same for both? Or maybe not, because same mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius. But the question doesn't give their radii, so perhaps R_p is the same for both planets.

Wait, the question says the planets have the same masses, but their radii aren't given. But the transit probability depends on R_p, but since we don't know R_p for each, maybe in this problem, R_p is the same for both? Or perhaps it's not necessary because the question is only about the other factors.

Wait, the question says both host stars have the same radii. So R_s for both is the same.

So, if P is proportional to (R_p^2)/(a^2) * (R_s^2)/(a^2) ? No, earlier I thought P = (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a)^2. So that's (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2) ) = R_p^2 / a^2. So P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2.

But wait, if R_p is the same for both planets, then P depends on 1/a^2.

So, which planet has a smaller a (semi-major axis), because a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4ÏÂ²/G(M_s)) a^3, where M_s is the mass of the star.

So, a^3 = (G M_s P^2) / (4 ÏÂ² )

So, a is proportional to (M_s P^2 )^(1/3).

So, a â (M_s)^(1/3) * P^(2/3)

Given that Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = P_2 / 3. Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.

So, P1 = P_2 /3.

So, a1 = [ (M1) * (P1)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (M2) * (P2)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Given that M1 = 2 * M2.

So, M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P_2 /3.

So, a1 = [ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Let's compute the ratio a1 / a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 M2) * (P2^2 / 9) ) / ( M2 * P2^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * P2Â²/9 = (2/9) M2 P2Â²

Denominator: M2 P2Â²

So the ratio inside is (2/9) M2 P2Â² / ( M2 P2Â² ) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3).

9 is 3^2, so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3).

So, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

But I need to find a for each planet to compute (R_p/a)^2 for each.

Wait, but earlier assumption was that P is proportional to (R_p/a)^2, but if R_p is the same for both, then P is proportional to 1/a^2.

So, the probability P1 for Planet_1 would be (R_p1^2)/(a1^2) = (R_p^2)/(a1^2)

Similarly, P2 = (R_p^2)/(a2^2 )

So, the ratio P1/P2 is (a2^2)/(a1^2 )

Since a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 ), then a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3 )

So (a2/a1 )^2 = (9/2)^(2/3 )

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1 )^2 = (9/2)^(2/3 )

Let me compute (9/2)^(2/3). 9 is 3^2, 2 is 2.

So ( (3^2)/(2) )^(2/3 ) = [ (3^2) / 2 ]^(2/3 ) = 3^(4/3) / 2^(2/3 )

Which is approximately (cube root of 81) / (cube root of 4 ) â 4.326 / 1.587 â 2.73.

So P1 is about 2.73 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, that's the ratio P1/P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. Option C says ~1.65 times.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because earlier, I thought P is proportional to (R_p/a)^2. But I'm not certain if that's correct. Let me think again.

Wait, in Kepler's third law, we have a^3 = (G(M_s) P^2 )/(4 ÏÂ² )

So, a = [ (G M_s P^2 )/(4 ÏÂ² ) ]^(1/3 )

So, a is proportional to ( M_s * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So, a1: M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

a1 = [ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3 )^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 M2 * P2Â² /9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ M2 * P2Â² ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = a2 * [ (2/9 ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is the same as a2 * (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3) )

9^(1/3) = (3^2)^(1/3) )= 3^(2/3 )

So, a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3) )/(3^(2/3) )

So, a1 = a2 * (2 / 9 )^(1/3 )

Which is a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(0.333)

Compute 2/9 â 0.2222, cube root is approximately 0.607.

So a1 â a2 * 0.607 â a1 is about 0.607 a2.

So, a1 is smaller than a2.

So, the transit probability is P = (R_p / a )^2 * (R_s / a )^2 ?

Wait, no, earlier confusion. Let me think. The transit probability is the product of the geometric probability (which is (R_s / a )^2 ) and the chance that the planet is large enough (R_p^2 / R_s^2 ), so overall P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2 ) * ( R_s^2 / a^2 ) ) = (R_p^2) / (a^2 )

So, P = (R_p / a )^2.

So, for each planet, P1 = (R_p1 / a1 )^2, P2 = (R_p2 / a2 )^2.

Assuming R_p1 = R_p2 (since both are Earth-like, but same mass doesn't imply same radius, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we should assume R_p is same for both).

Wait, but the question says both have the same masses. Since Earth's mass is about the same as other Earth-sized planets, but if the planet's radius is different, that could change R_p. Hmm.

But, since the question doesn't give R_p, perhaps we can assume R_p is the same for both. So R_p1 = R_p2.

Then, P1/P2 = ( ( R_p / a1 )^2 ) / ( ( R_p / a2 )^2 ) ) = (a2^2 / a1^2 ) = (a2 / a1 )^2.

We have a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So, a2 / a1 = 1/( (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ) = (9/2 )^(1/3 )

Thus, (a2 / a1 )^2 = (9/2 )^(2/3 )

Which is  (9^2 )^(1/3 ) / (2^2 )^(1/3 ) ) = 81^(1/3 ) / 4^(1/3 ) ) = (81/4 )^(1/3 )

Wait, 81 is 3^4, 4 is 2^2.

So, 81=3^4, 4=2^2.

So, 81/4= (3^4)/(2^2 )

Taking cube root:

(3^4)^(1/3) = 3^(4/3), (2^2)^(1/3)=2^(2/3).

So, (81/4 )^(1/3 ) = 3^(4/3) / 2^(2/3 )

Which is approximately 4.326 / 1.587 â 2.73.

So, P1/P2 â 2.73.

So, Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.73 times higher than Planet_2's.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So, the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.

But wait, earlier I thought the transit probability was (R_p/a)^2, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me cross-verify.

Alternative approach: The transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s )^2 multiplied by (R_s / a )^2, which simplifies to (R_p^2 )/(a^2 ). So same as before.

Therefore, the calculation holds.

Thus, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) depends on the planet's radius \( R_p \), the star's radius \( R_s \), and the planet's orbital distance \( a \). The formula is:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Planet 1** has an orbital period \( P_1 \) that is three times shorter than Planet 2's orbital period \( P_2 \), i.e., \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).
2. The host star of Planet 1 has twice the mass of Planet 2's host star, i.e., \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
3. Both stars have the same radius \( R_s \), and both planets are Earth-like with the same mass but unspecified radii. We assume \( R_p \) is the same for both planets.
4. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M_s \cdot P^2)^{1/3} \).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law:

\[
a \propto (M_s \cdot P^2)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet 1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2M_2 \cdot P_2^2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet 2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

The ratio of the orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2M_2 \cdot P_2^2}{9}}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{9^{1/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}}
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2 \). Assuming \( R_p \) is the same for both planets, the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substitute \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3^2}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \frac{3^{4/3}}{2^{2/3}}
\]

Approximate:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx 2.73
\]

### Conclusion:
Planet 1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet 2. Therefore, the researchers should observe Planet 1.
