Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to break it down.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of geometries, and pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic spaces maybe? Or was it something else?

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh right, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. So their geometry is hyperbolic. But how does that tie into the metric here?

Let me think: the metric given seems to be in 2D because it's only got dx² and dy². So it's a 2-dimensional space. The general form of a metric in 2D can sometimes be written in terms of a conformal factor. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So, the line element is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric.

I think the area of a surface in such a metric can be found by integrating the area element over the relevant region. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, since it's conformally flat, the metric tensor is diagonal, right? So the determinant would be the product of the components. For the metric given, the components (g_xx and g_yy) are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², but since it's diagonal, the square root of g would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) here would be sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² )= 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, what's the region we're integrating over? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests that the radius squared (x² + y²) must be less than 4. So the domain is a circle with radius 2, since sqrt(4) is 2. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So the maximum x² + y² possible is 4, beyond which the metric isn't defined. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because sometimes these metrics can have different properties, like being anti-de Sitter or something else. But I think in this case, since it's a 2D metric, and the area is being asked, I just need to compute the integral of the area element over the allowed region.

So the area A would be the double integral over x and y of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy, with x² + y² < 4.

Hmm, to compute this, it might be easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. So, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy = r dr dθ.

Substituting into the area element:

A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The limits for r would be from 0 to 2, because x² + y² = r² must be less than 4. And θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ:

A = (32) * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Now, compute the r integral: ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r. So (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr) / (4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du / u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0. Oh wait, that's a problem because ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral seems to be diverging.

Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0, so the integral becomes (-1/2)(-infty) which is positive infinity. So the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2 is divergent, it goes to infinity.

But wait, that can't be right because the area can't be infinite if the space is finite. Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface with finite area? Or perhaps I'm getting confused between different geometries.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but is it finite in extent? Or is it an infinite surface? Wait, no—pseudosphere as a surface embedded in 3D is finite, but in terms of the metric, perhaps the area is finite or infinite.

Wait, but in the 2D case, the metric given is for a space that's conformally flat, but as r approaches 2, the area element blows up. So the area becomes infinite, which would mean that the entire space is infinitely large, even though the radius is 2.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere in 3D is a finite surface, but maybe this is a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane has negative curvature and is unbounded.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with finite area. So why does the integral give infinity?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in setting up the integral. Maybe there's a coordinate issue. Let me think: the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The denominator is 4 - r², so the allowed r is up to 2, but as r approaches 2, the conformal factor goes to infinity, so the area element becomes infinite. So the area would be infinite. But that can't be right for a pseudosphere.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Maybe the area is finite. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the metric. The metric looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space, but perhaps scaled.

Wait, the hyperbolic metric in 2D can be written as ds² = (1/(K)) (dx² + dy²), where K is the curvature, but I think that's only in certain coordinate systems. Alternatively, the hyperbolic metric can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates, where the metric is ds² = (dr² + dz²)/z². But that's a different form.

Alternatively, another form of hyperbolic metric is ds² = (1/(1 + (r²)/(4R²)))^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but I'm not sure. Maybe the given metric is similar to that.

Wait, in our case, the denominator is 4 - r². So as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which would cause the metric to blow up. So this would be a point of infinite curvature, making the space have a boundary at r=2, similar to how the Poincaré disk model has a boundary at radius 1, with the metric blowing up there.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, the standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a finite area surface. So perhaps this metric isn't representing a pseudosphere but instead a hyperbolic space which is infinite in extent, leading to infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius in the question is different. Wait, the user specified r=2, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 is 2². So perhaps the radius parameter is 2, but the area is still infinite because the space is non-compact.

Wait, but how? Because the pseudosphere is a compact surface. Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the metric given is for a hyperbolic disk of radius 2, which is a finite region but with infinite area due to the curvature.

Wait, that can't be right because hyperbolic disks do have finite area. Wait, no, wait: in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk of radius r is (2π)(cosh(r) - 1), which is finite for finite r. So why is the integral I'm computing giving an infinite area?

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in setting up the integral. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the integral:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ 32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral: ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ) ] = 32 * ∫ ( (-du/2) / u ) = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which gives -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=0. At r=0, u=4.

So the integral is:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so:

-16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ -infty ] = positive infinity.

So the integral diverges to infinity. That suggests the area is infinite.

Wait, but I thought hyperbolic disk areas are finite. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps the metric given isn't for a hyperbolic disk but something else. Let me think about the metric again.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, 32 is 2^5. Hmm, perhaps it's a different scaling. Let me think about the Ricci scalar or curvature to figure out what type of geometry this is.

The Einstein-Hilbert action would involve the Ricci scalar. But maybe it's easier to note that a metric of the form ds² = (A²)/(a² - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) is a form of the metric for a hyperbolic space, but scaled.

Wait, the standard hyperbolic metric in 2D is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²)/(a²)), where a is a constant. But that's when the curvature is negative. Alternatively, sometimes the metric is written with a negative sign, like 1 + (r²)/(a²).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to see if it's hyperbolic.

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E² (dx² + dy²), where E is the conformal factor, is given by K = - (1/(2 E)) Δ(ln E), where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space.

Alternatively, another formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat: K = - (1/(2 E)) [ (1/E) ]_{,rr} - (1/(r E)) [ (1/E) ]_{,r} }.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression, but perhaps an easier approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature. Let me think.

The given conformal factor is E = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, no, wait: the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²) in polar coordinates.

So E² = 32/(4 - r²), so E = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in 2D for a metric ds² = E² (dr² + r² dθ²) is K = - (1/(2 E²)) [ (E^2)_{,rr} + (1/r) (E^2)_{,r} ) ].

Wait, let me compute E²: E² = 32/(4 - r²) = 32 (4 - r²)^{-1}.

Compute derivatives:

E²_r = 32 * (-1) * (4 - r²)^{-2} * (-2r) ) = 32 * 2r (4 - r²)^{-2} = 64 r/(4 - r²)^2.

E²_rr = derivative of E²_r with respect to r:

Using quotient rule: [64 (4 - r²)^2 * 1 - 64 r * 2 (4 - r²)(-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^4.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute E² and its derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature without working it out, because I know that if the metric is ds² = (A^2)/(a^2 - r^2) (dr² + r^2 dθ²), then the Gaussian curvature is K = 2/(A^2 a^2) )? Not sure, maybe I should compute it.

Wait, let's set A² = 32, a² =4, so a=2.

Compute E² =32/(4 - r²).

The formula for K is:

K = -(1/(2 E²)) [ (d/dr)(E² / r) ) * r + (d²/dr²)(E²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a different approach.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = λ² (dr² + r² dθ²) is K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ (dλ/dr / r ) + (d²λ/dr²) ) ].

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a conformally flat metric. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 E^2)) [ E_{rr} + (1/r) E_r ],

where E is the conformal factor.

So E = sqrt(32/(4 - r^2)).

So E = sqrt(32) * (4 - r²)^{-1/2}.

Compute E_r: derivative with respect to r.

E_r = sqrt(32) * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * (-2r) ) 

= sqrt(32) * (r) (4 - r²)^{-3/2} 

= sqrt(32) r / (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

E_rr: derivative of E_r.

Let me compute it:

E_rr = sqrt(32) [ (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * 1 + r * (-3/2) (4 - r²)^{-5/2} (-2r) ) ]

Simplify:

= sqrt(32) [ (4 - r²)^{-3/2} + (3 r²) (4 - r²)^{-5/2} ) ]

= sqrt(32) [ ( (4 - r²) + 3 r² ) / (4 - r²)^{5/2} } ]

= sqrt(32) [ (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^{5/2} } ]

Now, plug into K:

K = - (1/(2 E²)) [ E_rr + (1/r) E_r ]

E² is 32/(4 - r²).

So 1/(2 E²) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - ( (4 - r²)/(64) ) [ E_rr + (1/r) E_r ]

Compute each term:

E_rr is sqrt(32) (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r^2)^{5/2}.

(1/r) E_r is (1/r) * sqrt(32) r / (4 - r²)^{3/2} ) = sqrt(32) / (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

So,

E_rr + (1/r) E_r = sqrt(32) [ (4 + 2 r²)/(4 - r²)^{5/2} ) + 1/(4 - r²)^{3/2} ) ]

= sqrt(32) [ (4 + 2 r² + (4 - r²)) / (4 - r²)^{5/2} ) ]

Because 1/(4 - r²)^{3/2} = (4 - r²)/(4 - r²)^{5/2}.

So,

numerator inside the brackets becomes (4 + 2 r²) + (4 - r²) ) = 8 + r².

So,

E_rr + (1/r) E_r = sqrt(32) (8 + r²) / (4 - r²)^{5/2}.

Now, plug into K:

K = - ( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * [ sqrt(32) (8 + r²) / (4 - r²)^{5/2} ) ]

Simplify:

= - [ (4 - r²) * sqrt(32) (8 + r²) ) ] / (64 (4 - r²)^{5/2} )

= - [ sqrt(32) (8 + r²) ) ] / (64 (4 - r²)^{3/2} )

Hmm, sqrt(32) is 4 * sqrt(2), so 4 sqrt(2) = 4 * 2^{1/2}.

So,

K = - [ 4 * 2^{1/2} (8 + r²) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^{3/2} ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 / 64 = 1/16.

So,

K = - [ 2^{1/2} (8 + r²) ] / [ 16 (4 - r²)^{3/2} ]

= - [ (8 + r²) ] / [ 16 * 2^{-1/2} (4 - r²)^{3/2} )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write 2^{1/2} as sqrt(2):

K = - [ (8 + r²) * sqrt(2) ] / [ 16 (4 - r²)^{3/2} ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. I'm getting a K that depends on r, which can't be right if the space has constant curvature. That suggests that the metric isn't one of constant curvature, which is unexpected because I thought the question was about a pseudosphere, which has constant curvature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing K. Alternatively, maybe the metric isn't one of constant curvature, which would mean it's not a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the original question.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Pseudospheres have finite area, but according to the integral calculation, the area is infinite. So maybe the answer is option D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, but the area shouldn't depend on x and y because it's a global property. So options B and C are area functions that depend on position, which doesn't make sense for a global area. So only A and D are possible.

Option A is 0, which is wrong because the area isn't zero. So the only option left is D) +infty.

But why is that? Because the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

So the answer would be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Key Observations:
1. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor is \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), which depends on \( x^2 + y^2 \). This indicates that the geometry is hyperbolic, as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) suggests a curvature singularity at \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \).

2. The region of integration is limited to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the metric becomes singular when \( x^2 + y^2 \geq 4 \). This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

3. To compute the area, the area element in 2D is given by \( \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

4. The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the area becomes:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

5. To compute the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating this from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|4 - r^2|\right]_0^2 = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Here, \( \ln(0) \) diverges to \(-\infty\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = +\infty.
\]

6. Since the radial integral diverges, the total area \( A \) is infinite:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0):** Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)):** Incorrect, as the area is a global property and should not depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)):** Incorrect, for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\)):** Correct, as the integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

Answer: D
