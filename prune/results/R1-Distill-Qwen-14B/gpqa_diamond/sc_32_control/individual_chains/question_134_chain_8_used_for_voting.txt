Okay, so I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, let me think about what I know. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value I remember is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But let me get into the problem.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait a second, when you mix these together, maybe some reactions will happen. I need to figure out which acids and bases are reacting with each other.

So, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the HCl and H2SO4 (acids) will react with Ba(OH)2 (base) to produce water and some salts.

Let me list the possible reactions.

First, HCl (H+) and Ba(OH)2 (OH-). Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. HCl gives H+ and Cl-.

So the neutralization reaction for HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:
HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

Wait, but since Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula unit, the reaction would be:
2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly for H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid. Each mole gives two H+. So the reaction with Ba(OH)2 would be:
H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per mole, and H2SO4 has two H+ per mole. So the reaction should be 1:1 molar ratio.

So first, I need to find the moles of each acid and base.

Let me calculate the moles:

HCl: volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

Now, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 moles of H+ because it's diprotic. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Each mole of HCl provides 1 mole of H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Total H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reagent is OH-, because 0.2 mol OH- versus 0.28 mol H+. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, taking 0.2 mol H+ to form 0.2 mol H2O.

But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy change. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative.

The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

So each mole of H+ neutralizing OH- releases about 57 kJ (or sometimes given as 57.3 kJ, but I think in this problem, we can take approximately 57 kJ per mole).

So since 0.2 mol H+ (or OH-) are reacting, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units. The options are A in kcal, B in kcal, C in kcal, D in kJ.

Hmm, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. Wait, but that would make the enthalpy change -11.4 kJ, which is option D: -16.0 kJ? No, that's not matching. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact stoichiometry of the reaction. Because in the case of H2SO4, each mole gives two H+. So when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, how much OH- is consumed?

Wait, let's re-examine the reactions:

For each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are produced. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So the neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So per mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of OH- are consumed. So the H+ from H2SO4 (2 per mole) reacts with OH- (2 per mole of Ba(OH)2), so 1:1 ratio in terms of moles for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Similarly, for HCl, each mole gives 1 H+. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

Wait, so the reaction for HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

But here, the problem is mixing all three solutions together. So all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but I have to calculate which is the limiting reagent. Let me re-examine:

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is in excess. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

Since each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. Let me calculate:

11.4 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about 49.1 kJ. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases 57 kJ, but I'm considering all the H+ and OH- reacting, but perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is 57 kJ.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a diacidic base, so each mole gives two OH-. Does that affect the calculation? Because when you neutralize with a diprotic acid, perhaps each H+ gives 57 kJ, but in the case of H2SO4, both H+ are neutralized with OH-.

Wait, let's think about the moles:

The total moles of H+ available are from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So all 0.2 mol OH- will react with H+.

So the moles of H+ consumed is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Which would be approximately -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So none of the options directly match 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.56 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching my calculation.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than my -11.4 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that each mole of H+ gives 57 kJ. Wait, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acids and bases. So for each mole of H+ reacting, it's -57 kJ.

So with 0.2 moles reacting, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal → approximately -11.4 kJ, because 2.72 kcal *4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, 2.72 kcal is 2.72 *4.184 ≈ around 11.39 kJ. Oh wait, so 2.72 kcal is approximately 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

So if the problem's answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options present it as -2.72 kcal (option A) and option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.5 kJ.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think: probably the options have a mistake or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles correctly.

Let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is limiting.

So moles of H+ consumed is 0.2 mol.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. No, that's not matching. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, 0.2 mol H+ gives 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer should be -11.4 kJ, but none of the options directly give that. Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → about -47.5 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → approx -16.07 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So the correct calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is equivalent to -2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal, but wait, option A is listed as -2.72 kcal. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, so it should be -11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options except option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the enthalpy per mole. Let me think again.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid reacting with a base. But for H2SO4, which is diprotic, each mole releases two equivalents of H+, so maybe the calculation is done on a per mole of acid basis.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Let me think: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces two moles of water.

Similarly, each mole of HCl reacts with 0.5 moles of Ba(OH)2 (since two HCl per Ba(OH)2):

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So perhaps the enthalpy per mole of acid varies.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

So for HCl, each mole gives one H+, so each mole contributes 57 kJ.

For H2SO4, each mole gives two H+, so each mole contributes 2 * 57 = 114 kJ.

But wait, wait. No, that can't be right because when you have a diprotic acid reacting with a base, the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

So in the case of H2SO4, each H+ contributes -57 kJ. So two H+ per mole would contribute -114 kJ per mole.

But wait, wait, the neutralization is for each H+ ion. So regardless of the source, each H+ and OH- reaction releases 57 kJ.

So the total enthalpy is based on the number of H+ ions neutralized.

So in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D? No, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in neutralization, the first H+ is strong, and the second may not be as strong. So maybe only the first H+ contributes fully to the enthalpy. But I think in the case of strong acids like H2SO4, both H+ are considered strong, so both contribute.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second dissociation (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) is not as strong. So perhaps the second H+ doesn't release as much enthalpy.

Wait, but in this problem, when mixing with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, both H+ would be considered for neutralization.

Hmm, but I'm getting confused. Let me proceed with the initial calculation. So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, giving -11.4 kJ. So in the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy in kilocalories or kilojoules? The options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

Let me look again. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So the calculation gives me -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ, so 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches -11.4 kJ.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be around -47.5 kJ, which is much larger than our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the initial steps.

Wait, let me calculate the moles again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol.

H+ from HCl: 0.1 * 1 = 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is mixing all three solutions, and perhaps I have to consider the dilution, but no, the question is about the reaction, not the solution's heat capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → H+ = 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.28; OH- = 0.2.

So which is the limiting reagent? OH- is limiting.

So moles of H+ neutralized = 0.2.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D: -16.0 kJ? No, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are considered in terms of the acid-base pairs.

Another approach: Calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents for H+:

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 eq (since each HCl gives one H+).

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 eq (since each H2SO4 gives two H+).

Total H+ eq: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol → 0.2 eq (since each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-).

So OH- eq: 0.2.

So H+ is in excess; all OH- will react.

Total H+ consumed: 0.2.

Enthalpy: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D? No, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but when mixed with two acids, the neutralization includes more than just H+ and OH-.

Wait, but no, the neutralization is of H+ and OH- to form water, regardless of the source.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.

So, all three solutions are mixed. So all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Thus, only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, giving -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A). But option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of H+ from H2SO4. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the first dissociation, it's fully ionized, producing 2 H+ ions? Or is it that only the first H+ is fully ionized, and the second is a weak acid?

Wait, in reality, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- in two steps, but the first step is complete, the second is partial, but for the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, both H+ would be considered as available. But wait, in reality, the enthalpy of neutralization for the first H+ is about -57 kJ/mol, and the second is about -44 kJ/mol (because the second H+ isn't as strong).

If that's the case, then the total enthalpy would be the sum of both H+ neutralizations.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the first H+ gives -57 kJ/mol and the second gives around -44 kJ/mol.

In that case, the total enthalpy would be the sum of both.

So for H2SO4:

0.09 mol → 0.09 mol for first H+ and 0.09 mol for second H+.

But wait, in the reaction, Ba(OH)2 would neutralize both H+ from H2SO4.

So for H2SO4:

Each mole provides two H+. So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, we have 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

But the first 0.09 mol would contribute 0.09 * (-57) = -5.13 kJ.

The second 0.09 mol would contribute 0.09 * (-44) = -3.96 kJ.

So total from H2SO4: -5.13 -3.96 = -9.09 kJ.

For HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is -5.7 -9.09 = -14.79 kJ.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when all three solutions are mixed, the OH- is limiting. So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects each H+ to contribute 57 kJ, regardless of the acid strength.

Wait, but in reality, the enthalpy of neutralization for the first H+ of H2SO4 is about -57 kJ/mol, and the second is about -44 kJ/mol. So perhaps the correct calculation is:

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.1 → 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

Moles of H+ from H2SO4: first H+: 0.09 * (-57) = -5.13 kJ; second H+: 0.09 * (-44) = -3.96 kJ.

Total: -5.7 -5.13 -3.96 = -14.79 kJ.

But wait, but the OH- is 0.2 mol, which can neutralize 0.2 H+.

So which H+ is neutralized first?

In the case of mixing, the strongest acids (HCl) would donate their H+ first, as they are strong, and then the weaker ones (second H+ of H2SO4) would follow.

Wait, but in reality, the strong H+ (from HCl) would react first with the OH-.

So let's think in terms of priority.

Total OH- available: 0.2 mol.

H+ sources:

- HCl: 0.1 mol (strong, so all available)
- H2SO4 first H+: 0.09 mol (strong)
- H2SO4 second H+: 0.09 mol (weaker)

So the OH- would first neutralize the strongest H+.

So, the order would be:

1. HCl H+ (0.1 mol) → neutralizes 0.1 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 mol.

2. H2SO4 first H+ (0.09 mol) → neutralizes 0.09 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

3. H2SO4 second H+ (0.09 mol) → neutralizes 0.01 mol OH-.

So, the moles of H+ neutralized would be:

- HCl: 0.1 → enthalpy: 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

- H2SO4 first H+: 0.09 → enthalpy: 0.09 * (-57) = -5.13 kJ.

- H2SO4 second H+: 0.01 → enthalpy: 0.01 * (-44) = -0.44 kJ.

Total enthalpy: -5.7 -5.13 -0.44 = -11.27 kJ.

Wait, that's approximately -11.3 kJ, which matches our initial calculation of -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but this approach complicates things and the initial assumption that each H+ contributes 57 kJ is probably what's intended in the problem. So perhaps the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A).

But looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -47.5 kJ. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in this approach. Let me think again: If the neutralization is only for the strong H+ and the weak H+ are not considered in the exothermic reaction as much.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that each acid contributes their H+ fully. So let's calculate the total H+ from all sources and see.

Wait, no, the limiting reagent is OH-, so only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, regardless of their source.

So the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A).

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because that would be 11.42 kcal * 4.184 ≈ 47.5 kJ, which is larger than what we have.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in terms of the number of moles of H+ from each acid that are neutralized, considering the stoichiometry of the reactions.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of each acid reacting with the base.

For HCl:

The reaction is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

Moles of HCl available: 0.1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So, the required HCl for complete reaction with Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol. But only 0.1 mol HCl is available. So HCl is the limiting reagent.

So, HCl will completely react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

Moles of HCl used: 0.1 → produces 0.1 mol H+ neutralized.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 used: 0.05 → produces 0.1 mol OH- neutralized.

So after HCl reaction, remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol → produces 0.1 mol OH-.

Now, the remaining OH- is 0.1 mol, which will react with H2SO4.

The reaction for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 available: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 available: 0.05 mol.

So Ba(OH)2 is limiting.

Thus, 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.05 mol H2SO4.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so 0.05 mol H2SO4 → 0.1 mol H+.

So total H+ neutralized:

From HCl: 0.1.

From H2SO4: 0.1.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.2 mol.

So enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Same as before. So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option A as kcal (-2.72) or option D as -16 kJ. Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but our calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is not one of the options except for option D is -16.0 kJ. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Another approach: calculate the total equivalents and see.

HCl: 0.1 eq (since 1 H+ per mole).

H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.28.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.2.

So H+ in excess by 0.08 eq.

So all 0.2 eq of OH- are neutralized, giving 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ released, so -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that; the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the heat released per mole of acid-base reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, but the calculation leads to -2.72 kcal (option A).

But the options are a bit confusing. So, the correct answer based on the calculations is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A) or in kJ, it's not listed except for option D which is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem counts the moles of H+ from both acids, considering the stoichiometry with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let's think about each acid's reaction with Ba(OH)2.

HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2 in a 2:1 ratio.

H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 in a 1:1 ratio.

So:

For HCl:

Moles HCl: 0.1.

Moles Ba(OH)2 needed: 0.1 /2 = 0.05.

So Ba(OH)2 available is 0.1, so after reacting with HCl, 0.05 Ba(OH)2 remains.

For H2SO4:

Moles H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles Ba(OH)2 needed: 0.09.

But only 0.05 Ba(OH)2 remains after HCl reaction.

So H2SO4 can only react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.05 *2 = 0.1 mol H+ neutralized.

Thus, total H+ neutralized:

From HCl: 0.1 mol.

From H2SO4: 0.1 mol.

Total: 0.2 mol → 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So I'm confused.

Wait, the only option that is -11.4 kJ is not present, but option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is limiting, all \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \) will react, neutralizing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) for each \( \text{H}^+ \) neutralized.
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

4. **Convert units if necessary:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted to kcal.
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Approximately \( -47.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Approximately \( -16.07 \, \text{kJ} \), which does not match.
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it corresponds to the calculated enthalpy change of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted to kcal.

Answer: A
