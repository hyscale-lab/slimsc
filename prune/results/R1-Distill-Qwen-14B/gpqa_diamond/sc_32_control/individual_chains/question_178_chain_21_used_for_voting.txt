Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I'm supposed to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ† σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, actually, the notation here is ψ bar, which is ψ† γ⁰, right? So the Lagrangian is in terms of ψ bar, σ, ψ, and F.

Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γμ, γν]. Oh right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I suppose, since that's where F usually comes from. So this looks like an interaction term between fermions and gauge fields, maybe like a Dirac term but with σ_{μν}.

First, let's recall how to find the mass dimension of coupling constants. The mass dimension of an operator in a term of the Lagrangian depends on the fields involved and the term's overall dimension.

In four-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1), and the integral is over four dimensions (each dx has dimension -1 in mass units). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The term in question is L_int = κ [ψ bar σ_{μν} ψ] [F^{μν}]. Let me consider each part.

Let me denote each field's mass dimension. For fermions (like ψ), in four dimensions, each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iD - m)ψ = 0. The derivative D has dimension 1, and m is dimension 1. So ψ must have dimension 3/2. So ψ bar (which is ψ† γ⁰) also has dimension 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism. Each F is made from derivatives of the gauge field A. So F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ plus some terms if it's non-Abelian, but I think for this case, it's Abelian, like electromagnetism. So each F has dimension equal to the dimension of the derivative of A. The gauge field A has dimension 1 (since it's like a vector potential with terms like Aμ ~ ∂μ φ in Maxwell theory, and φ has dimension 1). So the derivative adds one, so F has dimension 2 (since ∂μ Aν has dimension 1 + 1 = 2).

Now, let's compute the dimensions of each part of the term.

The term [ψ bar σ_{μν} ψ] is a product of ψ bar (3/2) times σ_{μν} (which is a product of two gamma matrices) times ψ (3/2). The gamma matrices are dimensionless since they're just matrices, not operators or fields. So the product ψ bar σ ψ would have dimensions 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Because σ is just a product of gamma matrices (which are dim 0), so σ doesn't add anything.

Then the other part is F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the product [ψ bar σ ψ] [F] has dimension 3 + 2 = 5.

So the term L_int is κ multiplied by a term of dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ must make the whole term have dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension ≤ 0. Wait, no: wait, the general rule is that for a term in the Lagrangian with dimension D, the coupling has dimension [g] = D - (sum of fields' dimensions). But for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0 when you're in four dimensions. Because in four dimensions, the renormalizable terms are those where the dimension of the coupling is non-negative, so that the interaction doesn't require an infinite number of counterterms (i.e., the interactions are "local" and don't introduce high-dimension operators).

Wait, no, actually, the correct condition for renormalizability is that the coupling constant has a positive or zero mass dimension. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction term has a higher dimension. Wait, wait, let's think. The interaction term is L = g φ^n, or something like that. Each φ has dimension d, and the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for L = g φ^n, [g] = 4 - n [φ]. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥ 0, because otherwise, the coupling becomes stronger at higher energies (UV divergences), leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

In our case, the coupling κ has [κ]=-1. Since it's negative, this implies the interaction term is of higher dimension than 4. So the theory is non-renormalizable. Because, in four dimensions, any term with dimension higher than 4 would require the coupling to have a negative mass dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable. So, since [κ] = -1 < 0, the theory isn't renormalizable.

Wait, but let me double-check. The term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4, right? Because each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So the interaction term is L = κ [ψ bar σ F ψ], which has dimension 4. The product [ψ bar σ ψ F] is dimension 5 as we saw earlier. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the whole term have dim 4.

Now, in terms of renormalizability, the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. Since the coupling has a negative mass dimension, which is -1, which is less than zero. So the theory isn't renormalizable because the coupling is relevant (in the RG sense) or marginal? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. No, the key point is that if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction is non-renormalizable because each vertex in Feynman diagrams would have higher dimension, leading to more divergences that can't be absorbed by the same number of counterterms. So in this case, the coupling's dimension is negative, so the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together, the mass dimension is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2} \) in four spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has dimension 1.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \)
The interaction term \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} \) must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density in four dimensions has dimension 4. The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) involves two fermion fields and the dimensionless \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \), so it has mass dimension:
\[
[ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi ] = [ \psi ] + [ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) adds another dimension:
\[
[ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[ \kappa ] + 5 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension (\( [ \kappa ] \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [ \kappa ] = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term has a higher dimension (dimension 5) than the Lagrangian density (dimension 4). Such terms lead to non-renormalizable interactions, as they require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states \( [ \kappa ] = -1 \) but claims the theory is renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It states \( [ \kappa ] = 1 \), which is wrong.
- **Option C**: Correct. It states \( [ \kappa ] = -1 \) and correctly identifies the theory as non-renormalizable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It states \( [ \kappa ] = 1 \) and claims the theory is non-renormalizable, both of which are wrong.
