Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. So, you use a method like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization to make the math work and get finite results.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different because it's a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's a background-independent theory. Wait, but does it require regularization? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in string theory, the basic framework might not have the same kinds of divergences as in other quantum field theories because the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles. Or maybe it's because of the way interactions happen at the string level. But I'm not 100% certain if it ever requires regularization. Hmm.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that in QCD, at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weaker due to asymptotic freedom. Wait, but when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, you still get divergences. So they must use regularization methods like lattice regularization or others. So QCD does require regularization. So B isn't the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that in QED, you get divergent loop integrals, like in the calculation of the electron self-energy. Without regularization, these would cause problems, so they must use techniques like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So C is out as well.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so divergences as in QED or QCD wouldn't be a problem. Because in classical electromagnetism, you don't have the same issues with infinities arising from quantum fluctuations. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges, but the theory itself doesn't have the same divergent integrals because it's not a quantum theory. So D might be the correct answer because it never requires regularization as it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So theories like QED, QCD, and superstring theory (if it's a quantum theory) would require some form of regularization because they're quantum in nature. But classical electrodynamics isn't a quantum theory, so it doesn't have these divergent loop issues. Therefore, it never needs regularization because it's not a quantum field theory.

So putting it all together: the theories that are quantum (A, B, C) require regularization because of divergences. Classical E&M (D) doesn't, so the answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on whether they are quantum field theories or classical theories and whether they involve divergences that necessitate regularization.

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory of gravity and involves quantum fields. While it is background-independent and fundamentally based on strings, it still requires regularization to handle divergences in calculations, particularly in loop diagrams. Thus, it does require regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and a well-established quantum field theory. It deals with divergences in loop integrals, especially at high energies, and therefore requires regularization techniques like lattice regularization. Hence, QCD requires regularization.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It involves divergent loop integrals, such as those in the electron self-energy, which necessitate regularization methods like cutoff or dimensional regularization. Therefore, QED also requires regularization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory based on Maxwell's equations and does not involve quantum mechanics or quantum field theory. As a result, it does not encounter the divergences that require regularization. It is the only theory among the options that never requires regularization.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **Classical Electrodynamics**, as it is the only theory that does not require regularization at high energies.
