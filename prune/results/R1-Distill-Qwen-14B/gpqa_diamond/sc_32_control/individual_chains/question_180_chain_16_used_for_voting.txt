Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle is twice the charge of a proton. The particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, and I need to correct it to three decimal places. The options are given, so I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the formula for electric potential energy between point charges. The potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, in this problem, we have multiple charges. So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the system is isolated and the 13th charge is fixed at P, while the others are at 2 meters away, maybe I can compute the potential energy contributed by each of the 12 charges relative to the fixed one.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the 12 charges are all at a fixed distance from P, each of them is at 2 meters from P. So the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P is the same. So I can calculate the potential energy for one pair and then multiply by 12.

Also, I need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because if they are all at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other might be... Wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement. That's a bit confusing. So I need to think about how to calculate the potential energy between all the 12 charges.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy—so maybe the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the repulsion. Oh wait, but all are positive charges because each has 2e charge. All like charges repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, they should be as far apart as possible. But in this case, they are constrained at 2m from point P. Hmm, but how are they arranged around that point?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecagon or something on a sphere of radius 2m. But since they are constrained at a fixed distance, perhaps their positions don't affect the calculation as each pair's distance is the same. Or maybe each of the 12 charges is equidistant from each other as well. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The problem doesn't give their arrangement, so maybe it's assuming that the only potential energy comes from the interaction between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not between the 12 themselves. Because if that's the case, then the problem becomes easier.

Wait no, wait. Because the problem says the system consists of all 13 charges, so the potential energy would be the sum of all pairwise interactions. So that includes the interactions between the 12 charges at 2m from P and the fixed one, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but if I have 13 charges, each of them is 2e. So the total potential energy U is the sum of all pairs. Let me think: the formula for the total potential energy of a system of charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs (q_i q_j / r_ij).

In this case, since each charge is 2e, all q_i = q_j = 2e.

So, U = (k) * sum over all pairs ( (2e)*(2e) ) / r_ij.

But wait, we have two different types of pairs here. The first type is between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges at 2m. The second type is between each pair of the 12 charges, assuming they are all at the same distance from each other. Wait, but is that the case?

Hmm, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So perhaps it's assumed that all 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as well, which would be if they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2m. But wait, in reality, arranging 12 points equally on a sphere would mean each adjacent pair is separated by a certain arc length, but the straight-line distance (r_ij) between any two would depend on the angle between them. But perhaps the problem is making a simplifying assumption that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2m. That would make the math easier, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not the mutual potential energy between the 12 themselves. Because if the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their exact positions are not given, maybe the mutual potential is not considered. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. Therefore, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy would arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, which would minimize their mutual repulsion. But if they're all fixed at 2m from P, their arrangement among themselves is not specified. Hmm, but without knowing their mutual distances, how can we compute the potential energy between them?

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to approach this methodically.

Total potential energy U of the system is the sum of all individual pairs:

U = U_fixed + U_12,

where U_fixed is the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and U_12 is the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

Let me compute each part.

First, the fixed charge is at P. Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So the potential energy between each pair (fixed and a 12th charge) is:

U_single = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) 

But wait, no, because the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each such pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k.

So for each of the 12, that's U_single = k * (2e)^2 / (2m) 

So times 12, U_fixed = 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] = 12 * [ (2 k e²) / m ].

Wait, let me compute that:

Each of the 12 charges contributes (2e)(2e)/(2m) * k.

So that's (4e²)/(2m) * k = (2 e² k )/(m).

So 12 of them would be 12 * (2 e² k )/(m) ) = (24 e² k ) / m.

Wait, but what is m? The distance is 2 meters, so r=2m. So denominator is 2 meters.

Wait, r=2 m, so 2 meters.

Thus, U_fixed = 12 * [k*(2e)(2e)/(2 m)] 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the fixed charge. The formula is U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 meters.

So for each pair, U_i = k * (2e)(2e) / 2m = k * (4e²) / (2m) = (2 k e²) / m.

But since there are 12 such pairs (each of the 12 charges paired with the fixed one), U_fixed = 12 * (2 k e² / m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Hmm, so that's one part.

Now the other part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each pair among the 12 contributes U_ij = k * (2e)(2e) / r_ij.

But what is r_ij? The distance between any two of the 12 charges. Since they are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distance isn't given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is 2m from P, but their distances from each other are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is ignoring their mutual interactions because they are constrained and maybe that part is considered fixed. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, so all interactions must be considered. So I can't ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute it. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible. But that depends on their mutual distances. Hmm, but if they are all fixed at 2m from point P, perhaps the minimum potential energy between themselves would be when they are arranged in a way that each is as far as possible from the others. But without knowing their exact arrangement, how can I calculate this?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all 2m as well. That would be a simplification, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let's see.

If each of the 12 charges is 2m from P and each is 2m from every other charge, then each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from every other, forming a regular 12-gon on a sphere of radius 2m. But wait, that's not possible because the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is 4 (like the vertices of a tetrahedron). For 12 points, they cannot all be equidistant. So perhaps the problem is making a different assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves. Then, the minimum energy would just be U_fixed.

But that seems unlikely because the system includes all 13 charges, so their mutual interactions should contribute to the total energy.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are 2m, but that's not possible because of geometry. So perhaps the problem is considering only the potential between the fixed charge and the others, and not the mutual potential. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something else, but in that case, the mutual distances vary, and I can't compute the sum without knowing each distance. But without that information, maybe the problem is only considering the fixed charge and the 12, and not the 12's mutual interactions. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is designed in a way where the mutual interactions are negligible or considered zero. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are so tightly packed that their mutual potential energy is not significant compared to the potential with the fixed charge.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are as close as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum is when all the 12 are as far apart as possible, but without knowing their arrangement, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the answer options. They are in the order of 1e-26 to 1e-27. Let me compute the U_fixed part and see what I get.

Given that, U_fixed = 24 * k * e² / (2m) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each step.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So each has a U of (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). 

So U_per_pair = (k * 4e²) / (2m) = (2 k e²) / m.

With 12 such pairs, U_fixed = 12 * (2 k e² / m) = 24 k e² / m.

So 24 * (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (e²) / (2 m).

Wait, but what is the value of e? e is approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs.

So let me plug in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

r = 2 m.

So U_fixed = 24 * (8.988e9) * ( (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 is about 2.566, so 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply those: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23. (8.988 * 2 is 17.976, 8.988 * 0.566 ≈ 5.091. So total ≈ 23.067.)

So 23.067e(9-38) = 23.067e-29.

But wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e(9-38) )= 23.067 * 1e-29.

So about 2.3067e-28 (since 23.067e-29 is 2.3067e-28).

Wait, no, 23.067e-29 is 2.3067e-28? Wait, 23e-29 is 2.3e-28. Yes.

Wait, no:

Wait, 1e-29 is 10^-29. 23e-29 is 2.3e-28. So yes.

So that's 2.3067e-28.

Then, multiply by 24 and divide by 2.

Wait, wait the U_fixed is 24 * (8.988e9) * (e²) / 2.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2m, so in the U_per_pair, it's 2m. So when computing U_fixed, it's 24 * (k * e² * 4 ) / (2m) ?

Wait, let me correct this.

Wait, each U_per_pair is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m). So that's (4 e² k ) / (2m) ) = (2 e² k ) / m.

Oh wait, no: (2e)^2 is 4e². So 4e² * k / (2m) = (4/2) * e² k / m = 2 e² k / m.

So each pair contributes 2 e² k / m. 12 pairs: 24 e² k / m.

So U_fixed = 24 * (e² k ) / m.

So m is 2 meters.

So U_fixed = 24 * e² k / 2 = 12 e² k / 1 m.

Wait, m is 2, so 24 divided by 2 is 12.

So U_fixed = 12 * k * e².

Wait, with k=8.988e9, e=1.602e-19.

So compute 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

Let me compute 2.566 * 8.988 ≈ 23.067.

Exponents: 1e-38 * 1e9 = 1e-29.

So 23.067e-29 = 2.3067e-28.

Multiply by 12:

12 * 2.3067e-28 = 27.68e-28 = 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, approximately 2.768e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about ten times larger than this.

Wait, but wait—that's only considering the U_fixed. What about the U_12, the potential energy between the 12 charges?

I think I can't ignore that. So I need to calculate U_12, which is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

Each pair among the 12 contributes (2e)^2/(r_ij) multiplied by k.

But without knowing r_ij, how can I proceed? The problem doesn't specify the mutual distances between the 12 charges. I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equally spaced on a circle of radius 2m. So for example, placed at the vertices of a regular dodecagon. In that case, the distance between adjacent charges can be calculated, but the distance between non-adjacent ones will vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m, which would make the setup a regular simplex, but for 12 points, that's not possible because in 3D space, you can't have 12 equidistant points.

Wait, but without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. But that seems incorrect because the total potential energy should include all pairs.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only considering the interaction between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not between the 12 themselves. That would make the calculation straightforward, and the answer would be approximately 2.768e-27 J, which is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's higher.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recompute U_fixed precisely.

Compute U_fixed:

U_fixed = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m)

Wait, wait, no, each charge contributes a potential with the fixed charge: each is 2e, fixed is 2e, distance is 2m.

So U_per_pair = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k / m.

12 pairs: 12 * (2 e² k / m) = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters. So 24 e² k / 2 = 12 e² k.

So U_fixed = 12 * e² * k.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 12 * 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 1.07856e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38.

1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) 

1.07856 * 2.566 ≈ 2.768.

So 2.768e-27 J.

So this part is about 2.768e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. The closest options are B (2.822e-26) which is about ten times bigger, and C (7.056e-27) which is about 2.5 times bigger.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38.

1e11 * 1e-38 = 1e-27.

So 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.566) * 1e-27.

Which is 2.768 * 1e-27 = 2.768e-27 J.

So that's U_fixed. So that's approximately 2.768e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for something else. Oh wait, the 12 charges each contribute to the potential energy not just with the fixed charge, but also with each other. So I must also compute the sum of all pairs among the 12 charges. 

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is only considering the fixed charge's potential with the others, and thus U = U_fixed.

In that case, 2.768e-27 J is approximately 2.768e-27, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of pairs.

Wait, I thought that each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the fixed charge, so that's 12 pairs. But perhaps I should have considered the fixed charge as the 13th, and each of the 12 charges interacts with it. So 12 pairs. So no mistake there.

But perhaps the problem is actually considering all possible pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves. If the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from each other, which isn't possible, but perhaps assuming that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that, but it's not possible. So maybe the problem is only considering the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and not their mutual interactions.

But then, why the options don't have 2.768e-27? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm, my calculation gives 2.768e-27, which is about 0.2768e-26. None of the options match that. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me double-check.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge, so that's 12 pairs.

But the 12 charges themselves have (12 * 11)/2 = 66 pairs.

Ah, right! Because each pair is counted once.

So the total potential energy is the sum of U_fixed (12 pairs) plus U_12 (66 pairs).

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute U_12.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. Are the mutual distances also 2 m? That would only be possible if all the 12 charges are arranged on a circle of radius 2 m, but their mutual distances would vary. For example, adjacent charges would be 2 m apart if the circle's radius is 1 m, but in this case, radius is 2 m. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, but each charge is 2 m away from every other. Which isn't possible for 12 points.

So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances between the 12 are the same as their distance from point P, i.e., 2 m. But as I thought before, that's not possible, but perhaps it's a simplifying assumption.

So, for the sake of calculation, perhaps the problem assumes that each pair of the 12 charges is 2 m apart, which would make each pair contribute U = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = 2 e² k / m, same as each pair with the fixed charge.

So each of the 66 pairs (12 choose 2) contributes the same U.

So U_12 = 66 * (2 e² k ) / (2 m) ) = 66 * (e² k ) / m.

Wait, because 2e * 2e =4e², and 4e²/(2m) = 2e²/(m). So each pair contributes 2 e² k / m.

So U_12 = 66 * (2 e² k ) / (2 m) )? Wait, no, because 4e²/(2m) is 2e²/m.

Wait, each pair of the 12 contributes U_ij = k (2e)(2e)/(2m) )= (4 e² k)/(2m) )= 2 e² k / m.

So each of the 66 pairs contributes 2 e² k / m.

So U_12 = 66 * (2 e² k ) / m.

Hmm, but m is 2 meters.

So U_12 = 66 * (2 e² k ) / 2 = 66 * e² k.

Wait, with e² k being (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9.

Wait, e² = 2.566e-38 C².

So e² k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 ≈ 2.306e-28.

So U_12 = 66 * 2.306e-28 = approx 152e-28 = 1.52e-26 J.

Meanwhile, U_fixed was 2.768e-27 J.

So the total energy U_total = U_fixed + U_12 = approx 2.768e-27 + 1.52e-26 = 1.8e-26 J.

Wait, but that's about 1.8e-26 J, which is not among the options either.

Wait, but this approach seems incorrect because I can't assume that the mutual distances between the 12 are 2 m. So perhaps the problem does not require considering the mutual potential energy between the 12, and only the fixed charge's potential with the 12.

In that case, the energy would be 2.768e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C)7.056e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the number of pairs. Let me recalculate.

Wait, wait, U_fixed is 12 pairs, each contributing (2e)(2e)/(2m) * k.

Which is 12 * [ (4e²) * k / (2m) ) ] = 12 * [ (2 e² k ) / m ].

So that's 24 e² k / m.

Hmm, but earlier I thought m is 2, so 24 e² k / 2 = 12 e² k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e² k first.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

e² k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 ≈ 2.306e-28.

So 12 * (2.306e-28) = 2.767e-27 J.

So U_fixed is about 2.767e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well as from P. But that would require all 12 charges to form a regular icosahedron or something, but in reality, arranging 12 points so that each is 2m from every other is impossible. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake, and I should proceed under the assumption that only the potential with the fixed charge is considered.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 2.768e-27 J. But none of the options have this. The closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me compute U_fixed once again.

U_fixed = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) ]

= 12 * [ (4 e² k ) / (2m) ) ]

= 12 * [ 2 e² k / m ]

= (24 e² k ) / m 

m=2 meters:

= 24 e² k / 2 = 12 e² k.

Now, compute 12 * e² * k.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Multiply e² * k: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-28 *12 = 2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, so U_fixed is 2.767e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes to the potential energy with the fixed charge, but the number of pairs is 13 * 12? No, because the 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 contributes once, giving 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. The system has 13 charges: 12 at 2m from P, and 1 fixed at P. So the 12 charges each interact with the fixed one, giving 12 pairs.

No, that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, but when calculating the potential energy between two charges, it's (q1 q2) which is (2e)(2e) =4e².

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, using 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me recalculate using k=9e9.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k=9e9.

e² *k = 2.566e-38 *9e9 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3094e-28 *12= 2.7713e-27 J.

Still about 2.77e-27 J.

No, that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expressing the energy in terms of eV instead of J? No, the options are in J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

So e² *k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) * 1e-38+9 

2.566 *8.988 ≈23.067.

1e-38 +9 =1e-29.

So 23.067e-29 = 2.3067e-28.

So 12 * 2.3067e-28 = 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around: the 12 charges are each at (2 m) distance from the fixed charge, but the mutual distances are taken as 4 m. That would halve the potential energy between each pair. But without knowing, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy per charge, but no, the question is about the entire system.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Because when summing all pairs in a system, sometimes a factor of 1/2 is included to avoid double-counting.

Wait, when computing the total potential energy, each pair is counted once. So in the case of the 12 charges, each pair is considered once. So in the U_12 calculation, each of the 66 pairs contributes a certain amount, but I can't compute that without knowing their mutual distances.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are all 2 m, which is not realistic, but perhaps that's what it's doing.

So, if each of the 66 pairs contributes (2e)^2/(2m) *k = 2 e² k / m.

So U_12 =66 * (2 e² k ) / (2 m) ) ?

Wait, no, because each pair is separated by 2 m, so r_ij =2 m.

So U_ij = k (2e)^2/(2 m).

So U_ij = (4e² k )/(2m) )= 2 e² k / m.

So U_12 =66 * (2 e² k /m )

With m=2, that's 66 * (2 e² k ) / 2 = 66 * e² k.

Which is 66 * (2.306e-28 ) = 1.518e-26 J.

Adding U_fixed (2.768e-27) gives U_total ≈1.518e-26 + 0.2768e-26 = 1.7948e-26 J.

But this isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and only consider the potential with the fixed charge. So the answer would be approximately 2.768e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, 12 charges each interact with the fixed charge, so 12 pairs.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with 11 others, but since each pair is counted twice, the number is (12 *11)/2=66 pairs.

So, if I have to sum all pairs, including the fixed charge, it would be 12 (fixed and others) + 66 (the 12 among themselves) =78 pairs.

But without knowing the distances for the 66 pairs, I can't compute U_12.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs, and the answer is 2.768e-27 J. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is exactly 10 times larger than my U_fixed value (2.768e-27 ≈ 2.77e-27, 10 times that is 2.77e-26, which is close to option B (2.822e-26).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of pairs. Let me think: 13 particles. Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed one, that's 12 pairs. But the 13th is fixed and doesn't interact with anyone else.

Wait, no, the 13th is fixed at P, so it interacts with each of the 12. So that's 12 pairs.

The 12 charges interact among themselves in (12 choose 2) =66 pairs.

So the total number of pairs is 12+66=78.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute U_12.

Thus, perhaps the problem only expects me to compute the 12 pairs (U_fixed), leading to 2.768e-27 J.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P, but the fixed charge is at 0. So the distance from each of the 12 to P is 2 meters, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute U_fixed as 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m) ), which is 12*(4e² k)/(2m) )=12*(2e² k)/(m).

Wait, m=2: 12*(2e² k)/(2) )=12 e² k.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different unit for charge, like each charge is e instead of 2e. But no, the question says each is 2e.

Hmm, maybe the answer is option C, but my calculation is not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), and the total is 12 times that, leading to 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) )= 24 e² k/(2m) = 12 e² k/m.

Wait, but m is 2, so 12 e² k/(2) =6 e² k.

Wait, no, that would be 6 * e² k, but I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponents.

Let me recompute e² k:

e =1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² *k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) * 1e-38+9.

2.566 *8.988 ≈ 23.067.

1e-38+9=1e-29.

So 23.067e-29 =2.3067e-28.

So U_fixed = 12 * 2.3067e-28 = 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm. So I'm confident in this calculation, but it's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula with 1/(4πε₀), which is the same as k. So no difference there.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that each charge contributes to multiple pairs, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the problem is using e = 1.6e-19 C, so a slightly different value. Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19.

e² = 2.56e-38.

Then, e² *k =2.56e-38 *8.988e9 = approx 23.05e-29 =2.305e-28.

U_fixed =12 *2.305e-28 = 2.766e-27 J.

Still the same.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is at a distance of 2 meters from each other, but the fixed charge is at P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and the answer is 2.768e-27 J, which would be approximately 2.77e-27 J. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

C)7.056e-27 is approximately 2.56 times larger than 2.768e-27.

Wait, 2.768e-27 * 2.56 ≈7.06e-27.

Hmm, 2.56 is about (12 * 2) / (something?), not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges interacts with the others, and each pair is at 2 m. So each of the 66 pairs contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=2e² k/m.

So U_12 =66 * (2e² k/m).

With m=2, that's 66 * (2e² k ) / 2 )=66 e² k.

e² k =2.306e-28.

So U_12 =66 *2.306e-28 = 1.519e-26 J.

Adding U_fixed (2.768e-27) gives U_total =1.547e-26 J.

But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and then between each of the 12 and the fixed charge again? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question and the minimum energy is zero, but that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy between them is zero, but that's impossible because all are positive.

Wait, perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are as close as possible, but that would increase the potential energy, not minimize it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options, the only one that's in the right ballpark is option C, but my calculation gives 2.768e-27, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the exponent.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when computing e².

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2= (1.602)^2 *1e-38= 2.566 *1e-38=2.566e-38.

Yes, correct.

k=8.988e9.

So e² *k=2.566e-38 *8.988e9= 2.566*8.988= approx 23.067.

Exponents: 1e-38 *1e9=1e-29.

So 23.067e-29=2.3067e-28.

So 12 *2.3067e-28=2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J. But how?

Wait, perhaps I should compute U_fixed as 12 * k*(2e)^2/(2m) * (1/2).

Wait, why would I do that? Because each pair is counted once, so maybe I need to multiply by 1/2.

Wait, if I multiply by 1/2, then U_fixed =6 * e² k.

Which would be 6 *2.306e-28=1.383e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the potential energy in electron volts (eV) and then convert to joules, but no, the options are in joules.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around the fixed charge, so each is 2 m away, and the mutual distances are all the same. But without knowing the exact distance, I can't compute. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option B, 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times my U_fixed result. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, 2.768e-27 *10=2.768e-26, which is close to option B: 2.822e-26.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again: 12 charges, each interacting with the fixed charge, 12 pairs. But perhaps the problem is considering each charge as having 2e, which would be 2*1.6e-19=3.2e-19 C. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, no, the problem says each charge is 2e. So 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used 2e as 2 *1.602e-19=3.204e-19.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me think: 12 charges, each contributes one pair with the fixed charge, so 12 pairs.

But wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is interacting with the fixed charge, and the fixed charge is also interacting with each of the 12, but that would double the count. But no, because each pair is counted once.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities, but I can't get to any of the given options. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J. But I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

k=9e9.

e² *k=2.566e-38 *9e9=23.094e-29 =2.3094e-28.

12 *2.3094e-28=2.7713e-27 J.

Still the same value.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not multiply by 12, but by 13, but that doesn't make sense. Because the fixed charge is the 13th, each of the other 12 charges contributes one pair.

I think I have to conclude that the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J. But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Did the problem say 2 m from P, or 2 meters from each other? Let me check.

The problem states: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. So the distance from each of the 12 to P is 2 m.

Hmm. So perhaps the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2m, and the distance between any two of the 12 is 4 m. But that's just a guess.

If the mutual distance is 4m, then U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(4m) = (4e² k)/(4m) )= e² k / m.

So each of the 66 pairs would contribute e² k / m.

So U_12=66*(e² k)/m.

With m=2, that's 66*(e² k)/(2) )=33 e² k.

e² k=2.306e-28.

33 *2.306e-28=7.61e-27 J.

Adding U_fixed=2.768e-27 gives U_total=1.038e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended for us to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and the answer is 2.768e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27.

But 2.768e-27 * 2.56=7.05e-27.

Wait, 2.56 is approximately (sqrt(66)), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the 12 charges each at 2m, and considered the potential energy between them as well, each pair at 2m apart, which isn't possible, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

In that case, each of the 78 pairs (12 with fixed, 66 among themselves) would contribute (k (2e)^2 )/(2m) )= 2 e² k / m.

So U_total=78*(2 e² k)/m.

With m=2, that's 78*(2 e² k)/2=78 e² k.

78 *2.306e-28=1.800e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the calculations.

The only option close to U_fixed is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher than my U_fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again: perhaps the problem counts each pair twice, leading to 24 pairs, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, 12 pairs for U_fixed, and 66 for U_12, total 78 pairs.

If each contributes 2e² k / m, then U_total=78 * (2e²k)/m.

m=2, so (2e²k)/2= e² k.

So 78 e² k =78 *2.306e-28=1.8e-26 J.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the minimum potential energy to be when the 12 charges are all at the same point as P, but that's impossible because they would have infinite potential energy.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation of 2.768e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is exactly 2.56 times 2.768e-27. 2.56 is 2^8, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k (2e)^2)/(2m) ), and there are 12 such pairs.

So 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) )= 24 e² k/(2m) )=12 e² k/m.

With m=2, that's 6 e² k.

e² k=2.306e-28.

6 *2.306e-28=1.3836e-27 J.

Hmm, 1.38e-27 J, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the potential energy to be (k (2e)^2)/(2m) ) times 12, leading to 12*(2 e² k)/(m).

Wait, 2 e² k = 2 *2.306e-28=4.612e-28.

12 *4.612e-28=5.534e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.

If I compute 12*(2e)^2 *k/(2m) )= 12*(4e² k)/(2m) )= 24 e² k/(2m) )=12 e² k/m.

m=2: 6 e² k.

6 *2.306e-28= 1.3836e-27 J.

Hmm, still no.

I think I have to conclude that the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how to reach that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include only the fixed charge and the 12, but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered, but each pair is at a distance of 4 m. So each pair contributes U_ij= k*(2e)^2/(4m) )= (4e² k)/(4m )= e² k/m.

So U_12=66 * (e² k/m )=66 * (2.306e-28)/2=66 *1.153e-28=7.59e-27 J.

Adding U_fixed=2.768e-27 gives U_total=1.035e-26 J.

No, that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I've spent too much time on this. Based on my calculations, the closest option is C)7.056e-27, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

---

### **Key Analysis**

1. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).

2. **Fixed Charge and 12 Charges**:  
   The fixed charge at \( P \) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 meters. Each pair contributes:  
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2ke^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs:  
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed, total}} = 12 \cdot 2ke^2 = 24ke^2
   \]

3. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not explicitly given. If the problem assumes that each pair of the 12 charges is also 2 meters apart, the potential energy for each pair is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = 2ke^2
   \]  
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs, so:  
   \[
   U_{\text{12, total}} = 66 \cdot 2ke^2 = 132ke^2
   \]

4. **Total Potential Energy**:  
   The total potential energy is the sum of the contributions from the fixed charge and the mutual interactions:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed, total}} + U_{\text{12, total}} = 24ke^2 + 132ke^2 = 156ke^2
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   Using \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   ke^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9)(2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.306 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Substituting into \( U_{\text{total}} \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 3.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( 3.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the given options. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 2.5 times smaller than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup or missing assumptions.

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice from the given options is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, though the exact reasoning for the mismatch remains unclear.

**Answer: C**
