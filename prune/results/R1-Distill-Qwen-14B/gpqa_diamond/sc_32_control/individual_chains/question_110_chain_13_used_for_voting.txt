Okay, so I have this problem about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit for the stars it can observe. Let's see.

The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, apparent V magnitude less than 17, I think. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. Wait, no, wait. The wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it's detectable. So for ESPRESSO, any star with apparent V mag <=17.

HIRES has a limit of brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with apparent V mag <=16 can be detected by HIRES.

So the key is to find which stars have apparent magnitudes within both of these limits, meaning their apparent mag is <=16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is <=16, it's also <=17, so both can detect it. If a star is between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it, but that's not the case here for any of the options maybe.

Now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star, considering any reddening (extinction) due to dust, which is given by the E(B-V) and the formula for absorption.

Wait, the problem mentions that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. Oh, right, the formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the apparent magnitude would be the intrinsic magnitude plus Av.

But wait, let's think: the apparent magnitude m is the absolute magnitude M plus 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. But if there's extinction, the observed (apparent) magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av.

Wait no, actually, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10 pc) + A_v. Because A_v is the extinction, which makes the star appear dimmer, so higher magnitude. So I need to calculate m for each star, which is their absolute magnitude plus distance modulus plus extinction.

Wait, but some stars already have their apparent V magnitude given, so perhaps I need to check if that's the case. Let me look at each star.

Star1: absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So the distance modulus is 5*(log10(10) -1) )= 5*(1-1)=0. So apparent V mag is M + distance modulus + Av. But wait, Star1's distance is 10 pc, so distance modulus is 5*(log10(10) -1) )= 5*(1-1)=0. So no distance modulus. But does it have extinction? The problem says Star1's E(B-V) isn't given. Wait, looking at the problem statement, Star1's description is: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc, no E(B-V) mentioned. So I guess E(B-V)=0, so Av=0. So apparent V mag is 15.5 + 0 +0=15.5. So m=15.5.

So Star1's m is 15.5. Since both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect stars with m up to 17 and 16 respectively, Star1 (15.5) is detectable by both. Because 15.5 <16 and <17.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. E(B-V) not given? Wait, looking at the problem, Star2's description is: apparent V mag 16.5, but no E(B-V) given. So Av=0, because E(B-V)=0. So m=16.5.

Wait, but 16.5 is brighter than 16.5? Wait, no, for HIRES, the limit is stars brighter than 16 mag. So m <=16 can be detected. So Star2 has m=16.5, which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, since m=16.5 <17. So Star2 is detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.6. So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So the apparent magnitude would be m = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's the observed magnitude? Or is it the intrinsic magnitude? Wait, no, the description for Star3 says: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, but wait, no. Because E(B-V) affects the apparent magnitude. Wait, no, maybe the problem is a bit tricky here. Let me re-read.

Wait, the problem describes Star3 as having an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but also has E(B-V)=0.6. But no, extinction (Av) is adding to the apparent magnitude. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's intrinsic (absolute) magnitude is M. The apparent magnitude without extinction would be M + distance modulus. But if there is extinction, the apparent magnitude (what we observe) is m = M + distance modulus + Av.

So if Star3's apparent V mag is given as 15.5, that would already include the Av? Or is the given m the observed m, and I need to calculate the intrinsic m?

Wait, the problem says: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So m_observed = 15.5. But wait, no. Because if E(B-V) is given, then the observed magnitude is m = M + distance modulus + Av. So perhaps the apparent V mag given is the intrinsic one, and I need to add the extinction to get the observed. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The problem says, for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So the apparent magnitude is already the observed one, which includes extinction. Wait, no. Because when you observe a star, the apparent magnitude is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic (without extinction) because of extinction. So the formula is: m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So if you have m_observed, and E(B-V), can you find m_intrinsic?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but this is after accounting for extinction. No, no, no. Let me think again. The way the problem is written is: Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So to find the true apparent magnitude, do I have to add the extinction? Or is the given apparent mag already the observed one, which includes extinction? Hmm, maybe I should think that the apparent magnitude given is the observed magnitude. But then why is E(B-V) given? Because perhaps the problem is that the apparent magnitude is the observed one, so the extinction has already been added. So in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6, but that's not needed in this case. Wait, that can't be right because then why would E(B-V) matter? Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V magnitude provided is the intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude, and the observed is higher. So let me re-express.

Wait, for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5. But if there's extinction, the observed (apparent) magnitude would be 15.5 + Av. So Av is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86. So the observed m would be 15.5 + 1.86=17.36, which is above both 16 and 17. So neither spectrograph can detect it.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. I need to figure out whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

Looking back at the problem statement: the note says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (what we measure), so the actual m is 15.5, but the intrinsic magnitude is m_intrinsic = 15.5 - Av. But wait, no, that's not right. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed m is higher than the intrinsic m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction). So the observed apparent magnitude would be m = M + distance modulus + Av.

Wait, but Star3's description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5", so perhaps that's the observed m, which includes extinction. So we don't need to adjust it. But then why E(B-V) is given? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude, and the observed is m = 15.5 + Av.

So let's think: if Star3's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, Av=1.86, so the observed m =15.5 +1.86=17.36. That would make it too dim for both spectrographs. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, regardless of E(B-V). So perhaps I should use that 15.5 as the observed m, and ignore E(B-V), but that can't be. Because E(B-V) affects the apparent magnitude.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe each star's apparent magnitude is the observed value (after reddening), but for some stars, the apparent magnitude is intrinsic, and we have to calculate the observed one by adding Av.

Wait, let's re-examine each star's description:

Star1: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, 10 pc. So M=15.5, d=10 pc. So distance modulus is 5*(log10(10) -1) = 5*(1-1)=0. So apparent magnitude (without reddening) is 15.5. But E(B-V) is not given, so Av=0. So m=15.5. So Star1 is m=15.5, which is within both detectors.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, E(B-V) not given (so Av=0). So m=16.5. But HIRES can only go up to 16 mag. So Star2 has m=16.5, which is above HIRES's limit, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So observed m = m_intrinsic + Av. Wait, but wait, the problem says the apparent magnitude is 15.5. So is that the observed or the intrinsic? Because if it's the intrinsic, then the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. If it's the observed, then the intrinsic is m - Av=15.5-1.86=13.64.

Hmm, that's a confusion point. Let's think again. The problem says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But if there is extinction, the observed apparent magnitude would be higher (since extinction makes stars dimmer). So if Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, which includes the extinction, then we don't need to add anything. But why is E(B-V) given then? Because in that case, it wouldn't affect the apparent magnitude. So I think that the given apparent V mag is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the observed is higher.

Wait, but no. Let me think. Let's say a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude of m0, and extinction adds Av, making the observed m = m0 + Av. So if the problem says the apparent magnitude is 15.5, that would be m0, and the observed (what we see) is higher. But then why is E(B-V) given? Because that would affect the observed m.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent mag is the one after considering extinction, so it already includes Av. But then E(B-V) is provided, which doesn't make sense because Av can be computed from E(B-V), so why provide both?

This is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the apparent magnitude for each star, considering both the distance and the extinction.

Let me approach this step by step for each star:

1. Star1:
   - M =15.5
   - distance d=10 pc
   - E(B-V) = 0 (since it's not given)
   - Distance modulus = 5 * log10(10/10) = 0.
   - Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 0.
   - So apparent m = M + distance modulus + Av =15.5 +0 +0=15.5. So m=15.5. ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. Star2:
   - apparent V mag is 16.5 (so this is the observed m, which already includes Av?)
   - Or is the apparent V mag the intrinsic (without extinction)? Hmm.
   - Wait, the description is: apparent V mag of 16.5, located at 5 pc. E(B-V) not given, so Av=0.
   - So if the given apparent mag is 16.5, and Av is 0, then m=16.5. But wait, for Star2, the distance is 5 pc. The apparent magnitude without extinction would be M + 5 log10(5/10) = M + 5*(log10(0.5)) = M +5*(-0.3010)= M -1.505.
   - Wait, but the problem states that Star2's apparent V mag is 16.5. So if d=5 pc, then M = m - distance modulus - Av. But if the given m is 16.5, and E(B-V)=0, then M =16.5 - distance modulus.
   - But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe for Star2, since the apparent mag is given, and E(B-V)=0, its observed m is 16.5, which is higher than HIRES's limit of 16, so HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 <17.

3. Star3:
   - Apparent V mag is 15.5 (observed, including extinction?), E(B-V)=0.6.
   - Wait, but the problem says apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So if the observed m is 15.5, then the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - Av. Because m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.
   - So Av=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So m_intrinsic=15.5 -1.86 =13.64.
   - But wait, that can't be right. Because the apparent mag is what is observed, which includes extinction. So in this case, the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but due to extinction, its intrinsic m is m_obs - Av =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But how does that affect anything? Because the apparent magnitude is what's observed, so it's already 15.5, which is the m for both spectrographs.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think again: when a star's light passes through interstellar medium, it gets dimmed. So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is higher than the intrinsic (m0) because of extinction. So m = m0 + Av.

So for a star, if we know m0 and Av, then observed m is m0 + Av. But if we observe m and know Av, then m0 = m - Av.

In the problem, each star's description gives either m0 (intrinsic) or m (observed). Let's see:

- Star1: M=15.5 (absolute mag), d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.

So m0 (intrinsic apparent mag) is M + distance modulus + 0.

M=15.5, distance modulus=0. So m0=15.5.

Observed m = m0 + Av =15.5 +0=15.5.

- Star2: apparent V mag=16.5 (this is observed), E(B-V)=0.

So m_obs=16.5, Av=0. So m0=16.5.

- Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, which is observed. E(B-V)=0.6.

Av=1.86.

So m0 =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. But how does that affect the observed m? Because the observed m is already 15.5. So for detection, it's the observed m that matters. Because the telescopes observe the star's light, which is already dimmed.

So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is under both 17 and 16. So it can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not right. Because Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is the observed, so regardless of E(B-V), the observed m is 15.5.

Wait, but E(B-V) is given. So perhaps the apparent V magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the observed is higher. But then, how?

I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach for each star:

For each star, compute the observed apparent magnitude (m_obs), which is what the telescope sees. Then compare to the limits.

Compute m_obs = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av

Wait, M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

Av =3.1 * E(B-V). If E(B-V)=0, Av=0.

So:

Star1:

M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.

m_obs =15.5 +5*log10(10/10) +0 =15.5 +0=15.5. So m_obs=15.5 <16 and <17. So detectable by both.

Star2:

Problem description says apparent V mag is 16.5. Wait, so this is the observed m. So if observed m is 16.5, then regardless of M and d, the observed m is 16.5. But wait, that's not correct. Because apparent magnitude depends on both the star's intrinsic brightness and distance and extinction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that for some stars, the apparent magnitude is given as observed, while others are given as absolute magnitude. So let me look at each:

Star1: absolute mag (M) given. So need to compute m_obs.

Star2: apparent mag given (m_obs). So no need to compute, but check E(B-V). But wait E(B-V) is given, so I have to compute Av and add it. Because Star2's m_obs is 16.5, but with E(B-V)=0, Av=0. So no change.

Star3: apparent mag given (m_obs=15.5), but E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. So the question is, does this mean that the intrinsic apparent mag is m_obs - Av=15.5-1.86=13.64? But that's not relevant; the observed m is 15.5. So for detection, it's the observed m that matters.

Wait, but that would mean Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is okay for both. But that can't be right, because it would suggest that even though it's behind dust, the observed m is 15.5, so it's detectable.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Maybe I should approach this by computing each star's m_obs, regardless of whether the given is M or m.

Let's do that:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.

m_obs = 15.5 +5*(log10(10/10)) +0 =15.5.

Star2: The description says apparent V mag is 16.5. So this is m_obs. But perhaps the problem expects us to compute m_obs, given that Star2's M is not provided. Hmm, but the description says Star2's apparent V mag is 16.5. So perhaps the given m_obs is 16.5, without considering E(B-V), but Star2's E(B-V) is not given. Wait, no, the description for Star2 says E(B-V) isn't given, as it's not mentioned. Let me recheck:

Looking back, Star2's description: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. No E(B-V) is given. So Av=0. So m_obs=16.5.

So Star2's m_obs is 16.5.

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, but the given apparent V mag is 15.5, which already includes extinction. So m_obs=15.5. So the Av is 1.86, but m_obs is 15.5, which is the observed. So the star's light is already dimmed, but within the limits.

Wait, but this is confusing because if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but it's behind dust, that would have made it dimmer. So if the observed m is 15.5, the intrinsic would have been lower. But the problem says the apparent mag is 15.5, so regardless of E(B-V), the m_obs is 15.5.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it as follows:

Each star's apparent magnitude (m_obs) is either given directly or needs to be computed from M, distance, and Av.

Compute for each:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.

m_obs =15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) +0 =15.5.

Star2: m_obs given as 16.5, E(B-V)=0.

So m_obs=16.5.

Star3: m_obs given as 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. But since the observed m is given, perhaps we don't need to adjust. Because the given m_obs is already the observed one. So m_obs=15.5.

Wait, but if E(B-V) is given, perhaps the given m_obs is the intrinsic, and we need to compute the observed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all stars are given in terms of their intrinsic (without extinction) magnitudes, and we need to compute the observed m.

Wait, looking back, the problem says:

"In the case of Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6."

Wait, that suggests that the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the observed is higher. So for Star3:

Intrinsic m (without extinction) =15.5.

Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So observed m =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above both limits, so neither can detect it.

So Star3's m_obs=17.36, which is beyond both 16 and 17.

Star4: absolute V mag=15.5, distance=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_obs = M + distance modulus + Av.

Distance modulus: d=10 pc. 5*(log10(10/10))=0.

So m_obs=15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

Which is above HIRES's limit (16) but below ESPRESSO's (17). So only ESPRESSO can detect Star4.

Star5: absolute V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc, E(B-V) not given.

Av=0.

Distance modulus: 5*(log10(5/10))=5*(log10(0.5))=5*(-0.3010)=-1.505.

So m_obs=16.5 + (-1.505) +0=16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

So Star5's m_obs≈15.0, which is within both limits.

So now, let's list all the stars' m_obs:

Star1: 15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: 16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: if the given m is observed → 15.5 (detectable by both). But if given m is intrinsic and E(B-V) adds Av, then 17.36 → not detectable.

Hmm, this is the confusion point. Let me go back to the problem statement.

Problem statement says: for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

So if the apparent V magnitude is given, which already includes extinction, then m_obs=15.5. So Star3 is detectable by both.

But wait, that can't be right because E(B-V) is given, implying that it's relevant for calculating the observed m. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute m_obs from M, d, and E(B-V), even if some stars have their m given.

Wait, that complicates things.

Alternative approach: for each star, whether the given data allows us to compute m_obs. If the star has M and distance, compute m. If the star has m given, use it (assuming E(B-V) is zero, unless told otherwise).

But that would be incorrect because Star3 has E(B-V), which affects its m.

Alternatively, here's the approach:

For each star, compute m_obs as follows:

If the star's M is given, compute m_obs = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av.

If the star's apparent mag is given, assume that it's the observed (including Av). So m_obs is as given.

Wait, but for Star3, the apparent mag is given as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. But that would imply that the observed m is 15.5, but the intrinsic would be 15.5-1.86=13.64. But then why is the apparent mag given as 15.5? Because that's the observed.

So Star3's m_obs is 15.5.

So:

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m_obs≈15.0 → detectable by both.

Wait, but according to this, Star1, Star3, Star5 are detectable by both.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 4 and 5

B) 3 and 5

C)2 and3

D)1 and4

So none of these options include all three. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-calculate m_obs for each:

Star1:

M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=15.5 +5*(log(10/10)) +0=15.5.

Star2:

apparent mag is 16.5 (m_obs=16.5). So detectable by ESPRESSO (m<=17) but not HIRES (m<=16).

Star3:

apparent mag=15.5. So m_obs=15.5.

Star4:

M=15.5, d=10, E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=1.24.

m_obs=15.5 +0 +1.24=16.74.

Star5:

M=16.5, d=5, E(B-V)=0 → Av=0.

distance modulus=5*(log10(5/10))=5*(log10(0.5))=5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

m_obs=16.5 + (-1.505) +0=14.995≈15.0.

So Star5's m_obs≈15.0.

Now, which stars have m_obs <=16 and <=17.

Star1:15.5 → both.

Star2:16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3:15.5 → both.

Star4:16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5:15.0 → both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't include any option that includes all three. The options are:

A) 4 and 5 → both have m_obs 16.74 and 15.0.

Star4's m is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO can detect it. Star5 is detectable by both.

So A) Star4 and 5: Star4 can't be detected by HIRES (since 16.74>16), so only ESPRESSO can. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and 5: Star3's m_obs is 15.5, both can detect. Star5's m is 15.0, both can detect. So B is a possibility.

C) Star2 and 3: Star2's m is 16.5, only ESPRESSO. Star3's m is 15.5, both. So C is not correct since only Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and 4: Star1 is both, Star4 is only ESPRESSO. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m_obs is 15.5 because it's given as apparent. But if the given m is the observed (already including extinction), then Star3's m_obs is 15.5.

So looking back, I think the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent visual magnitude ($m_{\text{obs}}$) of each star. ESPRESSO can detect stars with $m_{\text{obs}} \leq 17$, while HIRES can detect stars with $m_{\text{obs}} \leq 16$. The apparent magnitude is calculated using the formula:

\[
m_{\text{obs}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_v

where $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $d$ is the distance in parsecs, and $A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V)$ is the extinction in the $V$ band. If the apparent magnitude is directly provided, it is assumed to already include extinction.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - $M = 15.5$, $d = 10$ pc, $E(B-V) = 0$.  
   - Distance modulus: $5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 0$.  
   - $A_v = 3.1 \cdot 0 = 0$.  
   - $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 0 + 0 = 15.5$.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5$, $E(B-V) = 0$.  
   - $A_v = 3.1 \cdot 0 = 0$.  
   - $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5$.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO only (since $16.5 > 16$).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - $A_v = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Since the apparent magnitude is given, it already includes extinction.  
   - $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5$.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - $M = 15.5$, $d = 10$ pc, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Distance modulus: $5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 0$.  
   - $A_v = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO only (since $16.74 > 16$).

5. **Star5**:  
   - $M = 16.5$, $d = 5$ pc, $E(B-V) = 0$.  
   - Distance modulus: $5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 5 \cdot (-0.301) = -1.505$.  
   - $A_v = 3.1 \cdot 0 = 0$.  
   - $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5 - 1.505 + 0 = 14.995 \approx 15.0$.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.  
- **Star2**: Detectable by ESPRESSO only.  
- **Star3**: Detectable by both.  
- **Star4**: Detectable by ESPRESSO only.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.  

From the options provided, the stars detectable by both spectrographs are **Star3 and Star5**.
