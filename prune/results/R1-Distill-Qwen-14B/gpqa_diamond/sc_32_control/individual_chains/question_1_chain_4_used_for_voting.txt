Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two levels. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state relates to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. The formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and τ is the lifetime.

So each state has a certain uncertainty in its energy based on its lifetime. To resolve two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that sum, the two states might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the uncertainty for each state.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But wait, the options are in eV, so I should convert ħ into eV·s. I think 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 J. So let's compute ħ in eV·s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Convert to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.60218e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.
So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV for E1 and 6.58e-8 eV for E2.

The total uncertainty when considering both states would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or wait, no, because when you're trying to resolve two states, maybe you're looking at the combined uncertainty. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the energy difference as needing to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, another approach. When you measure the energy of a state, the uncertainty is ΔE, so to distinguish two states, the energy difference ΔE_total must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the actual energies could be within ΔE1 and ΔE2 of their measured values, the two states must be separated by at least ΔE1 + ΔE2 for them to be clearly distinguishable.

So, ΔE_total >= ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Calculating that:

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = let me compute that. 6.58e-7 is 65.8e-8, so adding 6.58e-8 gives 72.38e-8 eV, which is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV). So option C would satisfy ΔE_total > sum of uncertainties.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the uncertainties.

Wait τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, so for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. ħ is 6.58e-16 eV·s. So 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Correct.

ΔE2 is 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV. Correct.

Sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way smaller than 7.238e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. So 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 100,000 times larger than 7.238e-7. So yes, it's way bigger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → still smaller than 7.238e-7.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: Maybe the energy difference doesn't have to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, but perhaps just each state's uncertainty? Or perhaps I've mixed something up. Let me think again.

In spectroscopy, the resolving power of a measurement is often determined by the uncertainty in energy. To clearly distinguish two lines, the separation between them must be greater than the uncertainty. But in this case, each state has its own uncertainty. So the actual energy levels could be anywhere within ±ΔE of their mean values. So for two states, their uncertainties add when determining the minimum separation.

But wait, another approach: the energy difference between the two states is ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and in E2 is ΔE2. So the minimum distinguishable ΔE must be at least ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the actual energies were E1 + ΔE1 and E2 - ΔE2, they might overlap if ΔE < ΔE1 + ΔE2. So that's why the sum is the required minimum.

So in that case, the energy difference must be larger than 7.238e-7 eV. Looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty for a state is given by \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant and \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. Converting \( \hbar \) into eV·s, we find \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

For the two states:
- The uncertainty for \( E_1 \) is \( \Delta E_1 = \hbar / \tau_1 = (6.582 \times 10^{-16}) / (10^{-9}) \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- The uncertainty for \( E_2 \) is \( \Delta E_2 = \hbar / \tau_2 = (6.582 \times 10^{-16}) / (10^{-8}) \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \).

To resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). Adding the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, comparing this threshold to the given options:
- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-9} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-11} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as \( 10^{-4} > 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-8} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two states.
