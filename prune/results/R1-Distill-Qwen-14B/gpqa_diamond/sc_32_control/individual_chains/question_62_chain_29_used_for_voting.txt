Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break that down.

First, I need to figure out what the target structure looks like. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. Let me parse the IUPAC name: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, that substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group (OH).

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane with a CHO group. Then, on carbon 1 of this ring, there's a substituent: it's a methyl group, which is connected to a cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and a hydroxyl (OH) group. So the substituent is -CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, wait, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which is CH2- where one of the H's is replaced by OH and perhaps another by cyclohexyl? Or wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, and that CH2 also has an OH? So the group is -(CH2-OH)-cyclohexyl? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 which also has an OH as a substituent? I think the structure is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has two substituents: one is cyclohexyl and the other is hydroxyl. So it's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and an OH. Oh wait, that would make it a CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl attached to the same carbon. So the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl? No, wait, maybe it's a CH2 group with one H replaced by OH and another by cyclohexyl. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Okay, so the target is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group, and a branch at position 1 that's a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl substituent.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

So, the synthesis steps must convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reagents. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So step 1 might be alkylation.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH. So ethyl chloride as an alkylating agent. Li and liquid NH3 is for Birch reduction or for deprotonation? Or maybe for elimination, like forming alkenes from alkyl halides.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2. So after alkylation, hydrogenation with CaCO3? Maybe hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond? Wait, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, making a CH2 group.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH. Methanol as an alkylating agent? Methanol isn't a good electrophile. Maybe it's for a Grignard reaction? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe step 1 is deprotonating something.

Wait, first, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with C≡CH). Let's think about the synthetic path.

We need to form a cyclohexane with a substituent that has a CH2(OH)cyclohexyl group. Also, the target has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

So perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized to introduce the formyl group and the substituent.

First, ethynylcyclohexane could undergo some alkyne chemistry. Maybe a hydration reaction. But let's think about each step.

Looking at the options, I think we can approach this by considering each reagent's role.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests oxidation. Where is the aldehyde coming from? Maybe from oxidation of a primary alcohol, but wait, the aldehyde is directly attached to the cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated and then oxidized.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Let's think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a CH2 group. How? Using hydrogenation. H2 with a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so C≡CH becomes CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, triple bonds upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd typically add two H's to become a cis double bond, but that's for alkenes. Wait, no: hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis double bond. But without a catalyst, maybe just the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond? Or wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a single bond via catalytic hydrogenation. Let me think—H2 and Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, adding two H's to the triple bond. So C≡CH would become CH2CH2? No, wait, no, that's not possible. The triple bond has two pi bonds. Adding two H's would make it a single bond. So the ethynyl group would become a methylene group (CH2). So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH?) No, wait the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH substituent. So after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent that's an ethynyl group (C≡CH). So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 group? No, it's more likely cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached directly. So when you hydrogenate the triple bond, you add two H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the triple bond (C≡CH) becomes CH2CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. So hydrogenation of C≡CH would become CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, the hydrogenation of an alkyne (like C≡CH) with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd) typically leads to the formation of an alkane. So C≡CH would add two H's to become CH2CH3. So the ethynyl group (C≡CH) becomes CH2CH3 after hydrogenation. So the cyclohexane would have a CH2CH3 group attached as a substituent.

Wait, but looking at the options, some reagents involve O3 (ozone), which is used for ozonolysis, breaking double bonds into carbonyls.

So perhaps the first step is to functionalize the ethynyl group into something that can be oxidized further.

Wait, another approach: maybe we can convert the alkyne into a ketone via some oxidation. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, let's think about the target structure. It has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane. So maybe a formyl group is introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol or via some other method.

Another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a propargyl alcohol or some other functional group. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Grignard reaction.

Wait, looking at the options, let me think about each step in each option.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Step 1: NaNH2 is a strong base used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So perhaps this is an alkylation. But where? If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a substituted alkyne, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, but where? The alkyne has acidic protons, so NaNH2 could deprotonate it, generating an alkyne anion. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it, but where?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating the triple bond would give a cyclohexyl-CH-C≡:–, which could attack methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH(CH3)-C≡CH? No, wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no—ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached directly. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexane-C≡C–. Then treating with methyl chloride would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, methyl chloride would provide CH3+ which would attack the deprotonated alkyne. So the alkyne (sp-hybridized) would add a methyl group.

Wait, the reaction of an alkyne with a strong base like NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but here it's NaNH2. So, in this case, would the alkyne become a strong base, and then methyl chloride would alkylate it, giving a new alkyne with a methyl group.

So after step 1, we have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? That would be propiolic cyclohexane. Then step 2 is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two H's. So cyclohexane-(CH2)2-CH3? Wait, no. Let's think: hydrogenation of C≡C to CH2-CH2. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. If the triple bond was between two carbons, hydrogenation would add two H's, making them single bonds. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that would mean the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, so the two carbons become CH2 groups. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but then the molecule is a straight chain.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. After alkylation with methyl chloride, the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 (propiolic cyclohexane). Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would convert the triple bond into a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that seems like a possible structure.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group and a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. So perhaps this path isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being hydrogenated to a double bond. Wait, no, H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, but sometimes with other catalysts, they can stop at the double bond. But without a poison like Lindlar's, which is for cis addition, perhaps the triple bond is fully hydrogenated.

Wait, but let's think about the steps in option A. After step 2, we have a fully hydrogenated structure. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation? No, wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used for elimination or for forming epoxides from alkenes, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, but that's for arenes. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides when using certain conditions. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions. Hmm. If step 2 gives a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, which is a straight chain, then Ba(OH)2 would perhaps cause an elimination, but where would the H's come from?

Alternatively, maybe I'm not thinking this through correctly. Let's move to another option.

Option C: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So step 1: alkyne deprotonated and methylated, making propiolic cyclohexane as before. Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. Maybe it's a hydrogenation. Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis followed by workup with a reductive workup, perhaps? (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would break the ozonides into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if the molecule after step 2 is a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, then ozonolysis wouldn't make sense because there are no double bonds. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the step 2 wrong. H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate: perhaps it's a selective hydrogenation. Or perhaps the hydrogenation is stopping at a double bond. Wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. But in that case, H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple to single, unless another catalyst is used. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkylation is forming a longer chain. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxyl group. So perhaps we need to introduce both groups.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe the alkyne is used to build a side chain.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, then hydrogenated to a CH2 group, and then oxidized to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: alkylate the alkyne with methyl chloride to make propiolic cyclohexane, then hydrogenate the alkyne to cyclohexane with a CH2 group. Then, perhaps add a hydroxyl group and form a ring.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the steps that would introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, another thought: the target has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 which also has an OH. So maybe that's a result of a ring-opening or a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. Let me think: if we have a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group, then perhaps a Grignard reagent would add to the aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think of the steps again.

Option D: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. So, maybe this is some kind of alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond) and then methanol acts as an electrophile. So the alkyne would be deprotonated to form an acetylide, then react with methanol to form a new alkyne.

So after step 1, we'd have cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Or wait, no, methanol would be CH3OH. So the acetylide would attack the methyl group from NaNH2 and CH3Cl? Wait no, in option D it's methanol, CH3OH.

Wait, let me think: the alkyne in ethynylcyclohexane is C≡CH. Deprotonating it with NaNH2 would give a lithium acetylide (or in this case, sodium?), which would then react with methanol. So the acetylide would attack the methyl group in CH3OH, leading to the formation of a new alkyne: cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, the acetylide is a strong base and would attack the proton in methanol, not the methyl. Oh, wait, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Maybe instead, the reaction is a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the alkyne's acetylide attacks a methyl group in another molecule, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is used to deprotonate a different site. Maybe the methanol is acting as a methylating agent. Wait, but methanol isn't a good methylating agent because it doesn't have a good leaving group. Usually, methyl chloride or another alkyl halide is used for that.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group. Then, on the same carbon as the formyl group, there's a substituent: a methyl group which has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

So, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to OH and cyclohexyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH)cyclohexyl.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH and another by cyclohexyl. So the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

But I'm not sure. Anyway, the substituent is a methyl group with two substituents: hydroxyl and cyclohexyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by both OH and cyclohexyl groups. But that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition followed by an epoxidation or some kind of dihydroxylation.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group and a substituent. So perhaps the aldehyde is introduced via oxidation, and the substituent comes from some kind of addition.

Looking at the options, some steps involve O3, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if there's a double bond somewhere, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diene, then ozonolysis is used to form a diketone, which can then be reduced or functionalized.

Wait, perhaps I should outline a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → Alkyne is alkylated (step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride)
   → Propiolic cyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3)
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (step 2: H2/Pd)
   → Cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3
3. Then, perhaps introduce a double bond or another functional group.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the target. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone.

Wait, another approach: use the alkyne to form a ketone. Alkyne to ketone can be done via hydration followed by oxidation.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see a hydration step. Let me look again.

Option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So, if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

So, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a double bond. How?

Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis addition, leading to a cis double bond. Or using a different catalyst, perhaps a trans addition.

Wait, but the options don't have Lindlar's catalyst. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C: step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So Pd with CaCO3 as a catalyst. I'm not exactly sure about that, but perhaps it's for hydrogenation. If the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then step 3 would involve ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, let's try this pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated with methyl chloride to make propiolic cyclohexane (C≡C-CH3)
2. Hydrogenated with H2/Pd to make a cis double bond (C=C-CH3)
3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the cyclohexane ring would have a carbonyl group, and the CH3 would also have a carbonyl group. But then we'd have a diketone, which doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me think of another pathway.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol group, then oxidizing it to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. So maybe the formyl comes from oxidizing a primary alcohol, and the substituent comes from a substitution or addition reaction.

Let me think about the reagents:

Option D includes Li and liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but maybe it's used for deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl-type position. For example, using NaNH2 and an alkyl halide could add a methyl group, then hydrogenation would make a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl)
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a CH2 group (H2/Pd)
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere to allow for ozonolysis to form the formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing where the double bond would come from. Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a CH2 group that can be oxidized.

Wait, another approach: maybe the hydrogenation is followed by an oxidation to form a carbonyl group. For example, after hydrogenation, if the structure is a secondary alcohol, oxidation would give a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated into a cis double bond, then ozonolysis is used to cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me outline possible steps for each option.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes propiolic cyclohexane (C≡C-CH3)
2. H2/Pd with CaCO3 → Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis double bond (C=C-CH3)
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → Cleave double bond into two carbonyls. So cyclohexane would have a carbonyl group, and the CH3 would also have a carbonyl group. But that gives a diketone, which doesn't match the target.
Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis is done in such a way to form a formyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a six-membered ring, and the ozonolysis would break a ring double bond.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me try to think of another option.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → Maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and then reacts with methanol. But methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction? Or perhaps it's a substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group from somewhere else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a protection step.

2. Li and liquid NH3 → This is a strong base, used for elimination or for deprotonation. Maybe it's used to form a double bond via elimination.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → Workup with ammonium hydroxide, maybe to form an amine or to protonate something.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of another angle. The target has a formyl group. So perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, to create a primary alcohol, perhaps a reduction followed by oxidation.

Looking at the options, several options have steps that could introduce an alcohol. For example, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and could lead to elimination, but sometimes it's used in epoxide openings or in oxidation reactions.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the substituent. So perhaps a cyclohexane ring is formed via a ring-opening or via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a result of a nucleophilic substitution. The substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached, which suggests that a cyclohexane ring was introduced via an SN2 reaction.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group to form an alcohol, which is then further modified.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl)
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a CH2 group (H2/Pd)
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere (maybe via elimination)
4. Ozonolyze to form a carbonyl group
5. Introduce a hydroxyl group via some reaction (like Ba(OH)2 treatment)

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps a cyclohexane ring is introduced via a substitution or addition.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a result of a ring-opening of an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form propiolic cyclohexane.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a CH2 group, giving a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group.
3. Then, perform a ring-opening or another reaction to introduce a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is introduced via a Grignard reaction, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, after hydrogenation to a CH2 group, maybe an oxidation step forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another possible pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form propiolic cyclohexane.
2. The alkyne is hydrogenated to a CH2 group, giving a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2CH3 group.
3. Then, a double bond is introduced elsewhere (perhaps via elimination with a strong base like Li/NH3)
4. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls, introducing the formyl group and another carbonyl.
5. Workup with something like NH4OH could hydrolyze ozonides into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes C≡C-CH3 (propiolic cyclohexane)
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → Hydrogenate the alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH3 (but I'm not sure about the exact structure)
3. O3 and (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis. If the structure after step 2 is a single bond (CH2CH2CH3), then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe after step 2, there's a double bond formed, allowing ozonolysis to cleave it.

Wait, maybe step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation but a partial one. For example, hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis double bond. So step 2 would produce a cyclohexane with a cis CH2-CH2 group.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the cyclohexane would have a carbonyl group, and the other part would form another carbonyl.

But the target has a formyl group, which is a CHO group, so perhaps one of the carbonyls is a formyl.

Wait, let me think. If the molecule after step 2 is cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group (but as a double bond, which isn't possible because H2/Pd typically fully hydrogenates alkynes), maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst is different.

Wait, another possibility: The H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is for hydrogenation of a triple bond to a double bond, but I'm not sure about that. Some catalysts can stop the hydrogenation at the double bond, but I think that's more common with Lindlar's catalyst for alkynes to cis alkenes.

If step 2 produces a cis double bond, then ozonolysis would break it. Let's say the molecule after step 2 is cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 (but as a double bond, so maybe CH2=CH-CH3). Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the cyclohexane ring is attached to the double bond. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a double bond, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond in the middle? No, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 → no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then another reaction introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the formyl group. The target has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, maybe one of the steps involves introducing a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Looking back at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis, which would produce carbonyls. So perhaps the molecule after step 2 has a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms a formyl group.

Wait, let's imagine the molecule after step 2 is cyclohexane attached to a CH2-CH2 group, but with a double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond (CH2-CH2 becomes CH2=CH2). Then, ozonolysis would cleave CH2=CH2 into two formyl groups (CHO). But that would give cyclohexane with two formyl groups, which doesn't match the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the target: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

The substituent is at position 1 of the cyclohexane, which has a formyl group. The substituent is a methyl group with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the methyl group comes from the alkyne's CH3 after hydrogenation. Then, the substituent would need to have a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a CH2 group, and then a substitution reaction occurs where the CH2 group gains a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution. But the substituent is attached to the main ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if we can form a primary alcohol from the CH2 group, then oxidize it to a formyl.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule after step 2 in option C is a diol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the reagents in each option and what they could accomplish.

Option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes and ketones.

If after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, if the double bond is in a position that would form a formyl group upon cleavage, that would fit the target.

Wait, let me imagine the structure after step 2.

After step 1: propiolic cyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).

After step 2 (H2/Pd-calcium carbonate): the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, making cyclohexane-C=C-CH3.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. The cyclohexane part would have a carbonyl group, and the CH3 part would have another.

Wait, but (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, so perhaps it prevents the formation of peroxides or other byproducts. So, ozonolysis of cyclohexane-C=C-CH3 would form cyclohexanone and formaldehyde (HCHO). But the target has a formyl group attached to the ring, so perhaps that's where it comes from.

So, the ring would have a ketone group (cyclohexanone), and the other product would be formaldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, not a ketone. So, perhaps the cyclohexanone is then reduced or something else happens. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage would yield a formyl group on the cyclohexane. So, if the double bond is between the ring and the CH3, ozonolysis would break it, giving a carbonyl group on the ring and a formaldehyde on the other side.

Wait, but how would that structure look? The cyclohexane would have a carbonyl group attached (like cyclohexanone), and the other product would be formaldehyde.

Hmm, but the target has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps that's correct. Then, the substituent would come from somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via another reaction step.

Wait, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It could be used for elimination reactions or for saponification. But in this context, perhaps it's used to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule is a diketone, and Ba(OH)2 is used to perform a Dieckmann condensation or some kind of cyclization, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach.

The target has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 which also has an OH. So, this substituent might have been formed via some kind of substitution where a leaving group is replaced by both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. But that seems unlikely.

Another possibility: the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group are introduced in separate steps.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. For example, a Grignard reagent attacks a carbonyl group, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit with the given reagents.

Wait, another angle: the substituent has a hydroxyl group, suggesting that an alcohol was formed via reduction of a ketone or aldehyde, or via hydrolysis.

Looking at the options, some steps involve H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are conditions for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones (like the Parikh-Doering oxidation), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, these conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) are used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the alcohol's position.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl group is introduced via a reduction step, followed by an oxidation.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think which option correctly forms the necessary functional groups.

The target has a formyl group, which is a CHO. So, one of the steps must introduce that. Ozonolysis can create carbonyl groups, so perhaps that's how the formyl is formed.

Looking at option C, after ozonolysis, the formyl would be present. Then, the substituent would need to have a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via another alkylation or addition step.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: look for each option and see if the steps logically lead to the target.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne to form propiolic cyclohexane.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps an elimination reaction, forming a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: oxidation, perhaps of an alcohol to a ketone.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target, which has a formyl and a substituent with OH and cyclohexyl.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne to form a longer chain.
2. Li/liq. NH3: maybe a Birch reduction or elimination to form a double bond.
3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis to form carbonyls.
4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps to form amines or aldehydes.

But I'm not sure.

Option C:

1. Alkylation to make propiolic cyclohexane.
2. Hydrogenate to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyls: formyl and another.
4. Ba(OH)2: maybe a base-induced elimination or ring formation.

Hmm, perhaps after ozonolysis, the formyl is attached to the ring, and the Ba(OH)2 step forms the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the Ba(OH)2 step is for forming a diol, which then can be oxidized.

But I'm not certain.

Option D:

1. Alkylate with methanol, which I'm not sure about.
2. Li and NH3: perhaps forms a Grignard-like reagent or induces elimination.
3. Ozonolysis.
4. NH4OH: workup.

Not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the order of steps. The target has a formyl group and a substituent. If the formyl comes from ozonolysis, then the ozonolysis must happen after the double bond is formed.

So, the steps would be:

1. Alkyne alkylation.
2. Hydrogenate to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form formyl.
4. Introduce substituent via another step.

Looking at option C, after ozonolysis, the Ba(OH)2 step would then perhaps form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide, which upon ring-opening would form a diol, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to cause a ring expansion or some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 step is a Hofmann elimination, creating an alkene, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here.

Another approach: think about the possible reactions each reagent would perform in the options.

Option C: Steps 1-4 are Alkylation, hydrogenation to a double bond, ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2.

After ozonolysis, the molecule would have a formyl group. Then Ba(OH)2 could perform an elimination to form a double bond or perhaps induce some kind of cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 step is for forming an epoxide, which would then be opened by something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could dehydrate an alcohol to form an alkene.

Hmm, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have a structure where a hydroxyl group is present, which Ba(OH)2 could dehydrate to form a double bond.

But I'm not sure how that would form the substituent we need.

Wait, another thought: the substituent has a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to a carbonyl group to form the substituent.

But where would the Grignard come from in the reagents? Looking at the options, none of them include Mg, which is needed for Grignard reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the correct sequence.

The correct sequence must:

1. Convert the alkyne into a structure that can form the formyl group.
2. Introduce the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne with methyl chloride to form propiolic cyclohexane.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, creating a CH2 group.
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere to allow ozonolysis to form the formyl group.
4. Perform ozonolysis to form the formyl group.
5. Introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups via substitution or addition.

But I'm not seeing how this fits into the options.

Wait, looking back, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of primary alcohols to ketones under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the substituent's cyclohexyl group might come from a ring-opening of an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclopropane ring is opened, but that's not applicable here.

I'm stuck. Maybe it's time to make an educated guess based on the options and the process of elimination.

Option C seems to involve alkylation, hydrogenation to a double bond, ozonolysis, and Ba(OH)2. Ozonolysis would form the formyl group, and Ba(OH)2 might help in forming the substituent with the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, option D starts with methanol, which might not be the best alkylating agent, so perhaps option C is more plausible.

Wait, another observation: the target has a formyl group, which implies an oxidation from a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the reagents, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used for the oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but under certain conditions, primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes. Wait, no, typically, with HgSO4 and H2SO4, primary alcohols are oxidized to carboxylic acids. To get an aldehyde, you need a different condition, like CrO3 under specific conditions.

So, perhaps none of the options directly form the aldehyde via oxidation. Alternatively, the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkene produces carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule has an internal alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. If one of those is a formyl, then that would fit.

So, perhaps after ozonolysis, the formyl group is attached to the ring.

Putting it all together, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the substituent's cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide followed by a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a SN2 reaction where a good leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. But I don't see how that would happen in the given steps.

Hmm. I think I've gone as far as I can. Based on the options and the need to form a formyl group via ozonolysis, I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the alkyne, forming propiolic cyclohexane.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane with a CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ group.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, and H₂O suggest oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the formyl group or the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. This option does not align well with the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer chain.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is typically used for elimination or Birch reduction, potentially forming a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the substituent is formed. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming propiolic cyclohexane.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate hydrogenates the alkyne to a double bond, likely a cis-alkene.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, cleaving the double bond into two carbonyl groups. This step could introduce the formyl group (CHO) on the cyclohexane ring.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, potentially used for elimination or to form the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. This sequence logically aligns with the target structure.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely fail to effectively alkylate the alkyne, as methanol is not a strong electrophile.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is used for elimination or Birch reduction.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the substituent is formed. This option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reactions. The alkylation step introduces a methyl group, hydrogenation forms a double bond, ozonolysis introduces the formyl group, and Ba(OH)₂ likely helps in forming the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. This aligns with the structure of the target molecule.

**Answer: C**
