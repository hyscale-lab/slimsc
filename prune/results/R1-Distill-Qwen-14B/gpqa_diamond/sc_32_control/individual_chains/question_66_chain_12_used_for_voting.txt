Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're based on. The Standard Model respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT would too.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in the SMEFT framework, the operators are local, so they should respect all the symmetries of the SM. The SM definitely respects both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But wait, Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry group. So if all operators respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or is it that the theory as a whole must respect Poincare, but individual operators don't have to?

Hmm, SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains the symmetries of the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry because it includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry, but I'm not so sure about Poincare. Because in effective theories, sometimes you can have operators that break certain symmetries as long as the theory as a whole doesn't. Or maybe the operators are required to respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators beyond the SM. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But what about Poincare? I think Poincare includes translations, which involve momentum space. Operators are local, so they should be translationally invariant, but if the operator is local, it's invariant under translations. Because operators are products of fields at the same spacetime point, so moving the point via translation doesn't change the operator's form. So all operators in SMEFT are built from fields that transform covariantly under Poincare, but maybe the individual operators don't have to be Poincare symmetric individually? Or do they?

Wait, no, each operator must be a Poincare-invariant operator. Because if the theory is Poincare-invariant, then all the operators must be Poincare scalars. Because the action is a sum of terms, each of which must have the same symmetry. So each operator must transform in such a way that when you vary the fields, the operator remains the same. So in that case, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the SMEFT doesn't require individual operators to be Poincare invariant, but the entire action is.

Wait, the SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian. The SM Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, so any added terms must also respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, because the entire action must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if operators must respect Poincare, then they must respect Lorentz as a subset. So which one is more correct: do operators respect Poincare symmetry or Lorentz?

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So the options are 1,2,3,4, and the choices are combinations.

Now, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. But does that mean that each operator must be invariant under Poincare? Or just that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, which it is because the SM is.

Wait, the operators themselves are part of the Lagrangian. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. Because if an operator is not a Poincare scalar, then the Lagrangian wouldn't be Poincare-invariant. So yes, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. Therefore, operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) are both correct? But wait, if operators must respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz because Lorentz is a subset of Poincare. So maybe the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Wait, but the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, the options are given as 1,2, etc. So option A is 1 and 2. But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators are only required to be Lorentz invariant, not necessarily Poincare. Because the Poincare includes translations, but operators are local, so perhaps their form doesn't change under translations. So their operators are automatically translation invariant, so the requirement is that each operator is a Lorentz scalar. In that case, Lorentz symmetry is required, but Poincare is automatically satisfied because the operator is a local scalar. So perhaps all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, but Poincare isn't a separate requirement because the operator being local implies translation invariance.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for more general principles. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory valid below some cutoff. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so the effective theory must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. 

But what about Poincare? The SM is Poincare-invariant, which includes translational symmetry. So the SMEFT Lagrangian must also be Poincare-invariant. But each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Because otherwise, the Lagrangian wouldn't be invariant. For example, if an operator changes under a translation, then the Lagrangian would change when you translate the spacetime point, which would break Poincare invariance.

Wait, but the operators are terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is a function of spacetime, and for it to be Poincare-invariant, each term must be a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Hence, each operator must be invariant under Poincare.

So that would mean that both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries (options 1 and 2) are required. So looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2.

But wait, I've also heard that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, but I'm not sure about Poincare. Let me think again. The Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation. The translation part is about shifting spacetime. Since the operators are inserted at a point, but the Lagrangian is integrated over spacetime, so each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under translations.

Wait, I think that each term in the Lagrangian is a scalar under translations because they are functions of spacetime. So for the Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare.

So that would mean that both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected. So in the options, both 1 and 2 are correct, so option A.

Wait, but the question is about "all operators must be respected" â€” meaning each operator must transform correctly under these symmetries. So if all operators must transform as scalars under Lorentz and Poincare, then they must respect both symmetries.

But wait, if an operator is a scalar under Poincare, then it's automatically a scalar under Lorentz. So why would both 1 and 2 be correct? Maybe because the question lists them as separate options, and in reality, both are required.

So option A is 1 and 2.

Now, what about the other options: CP and CPT symmetry.

CP is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry, as we know from the CKM mechanism causing CP violation. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT would not require operators to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is out.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry, combining C, P, and T. The SM respects CPT symmetry. So any effective theory must respect CPT, because it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So in the SMEFT, the operators must respect CPT symmetry. Because the underlying theory (SM) does, and the effective theory must also respect it. So each operator must be part of a CPT-invariant Lagrangian.

So in that case, the operators must respect CPT symmetry. So the correct options are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but that's not any of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, option C is 1, 2, and 4. So if I thought that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then the answer would be option C. But earlier I thought that the operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, and CPT. So option C would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that each operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare. But is that accurate?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct symmetries are Lorentz and CPT. Because the SMEFT is built respecting the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Lorentz and CPT, but not CP. So operators must be Lorentz scalars and respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but what about Poincare? Because the SM is Poincare-invariant, so the SMEFT must also be. Therefore, the operators must be Poincare scalars, which includes Lorentz and translational invariance. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which is option 2, and CPT symmetry, option 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that operators must be Poincare scalars, meaning 1 and 2 are both required. But also CPT is required. So the only option that includes 2 and 4 is option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but option C says 1,2,4. So that would mean Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But wait, if operators must respect Poincare, which is option 2, and CPT which is 4, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But the Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry, including translations. So perhaps each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So they must respect both Lorentz and translation. But does that mean that operators must respect Poincare, making option 2 correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT is formulated in a way where the operators are built to be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are not required to be Poincare scalars because the theory already respects Poincare via the SM structure. Wait, but the operators are part of the Lagrangian, so each must contribute to a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

So then all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think of it another way. The SM is Poincare-invariant. When you add higher-dimensional operators, they must preserve this invariance. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, which includes translations. Hence, options 1 and 2 must be respected.

Now, what about CPT? The SM respects CPT, so the SMEFT must as well. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT doesn't require operators to be Poincare scalars because the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant regardless of individual operators. But that can't be right because the Lagrangian is made up of operators and each must transform as a scalar for the Lagrangian to be invariant.

So to sum up:

Which symmetries must all operators respect?

- Lorentz (1) Yes.

- Poincare (2) Yes, because operators must be Poincare scalars.

- CP (3) No, as SM doesn't respect it.

- CPT (4) Yes, because the SM respects it and the SMEFT must as well.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM, as the SMEFT is designed to reduce to the SM at low energies. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**:  
   The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and the SMEFT, being an extension of the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This means all operators in the SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

2. **PoincarÃ© Symmetry**:  
   PoincarÃ© symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. The SM is PoincarÃ©-invariant, and the SMEFT, as an effective theory, must preserve this symmetry. Since the operators in the SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, they must individually be PoincarÃ© scalars to ensure the entire Lagrangian is PoincarÃ©-invariant. Thus, PoincarÃ© symmetry (option 2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**:  
   The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in processes like the CKM mechanism. Since the SMEFT is designed to extend the SM, it does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry (option 3) is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**:  
   The SM respects CPT symmetry, and the SMEFT, as an effective theory, must also respect this symmetry. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4).

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), PoincarÃ© symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to option **C**.
