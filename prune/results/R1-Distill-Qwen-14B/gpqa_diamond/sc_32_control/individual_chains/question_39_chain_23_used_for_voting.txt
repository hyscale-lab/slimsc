Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position of the particles, all of them are found between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, so the wave function is a complex function because there's an 'i' there, which is the square root of -1. But I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it has to be normalized. Normalization means that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. That way, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. But wait, that can't be right. Because for a wave function, the real and imaginary parts are separate. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is written as a real part plus an imaginary part. Like, maybe it's a / sqrt(1 +x) plus (-0.5i). So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

But when calculating the normalization, the important thing is the square of the absolute value of ψ. The absolute square is ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate. So if ψ = A + Bi, then ψ* = A - Bi. So ψψ* = A² + B². So the imaginary part's coefficient, which is -0.5, when squared, gives (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the absolute square of ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1. So I need to compute the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3, and set it equal to 1.

Wait, so let's write that out. The integral becomes:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1

I can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1

Let me compute each integral separately. 

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2)

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2)

Second integral: ∫dx from 1 to 3 is (3 - 1) = 2. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5

Adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

What is ln(2) approximately? I think it's about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213

Wait, wait, wait. Because 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is approximately 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking back at the options, option B is 0.85. That must be the correct answer.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions: the integral of the absolute square of \( \psi(x) \) over all space must equal 1. 

The absolute square of \( \psi(x) \) is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \), the antiderivative is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} dx \), the result is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). Multiplying by 0.25 gives:

\[
0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.
