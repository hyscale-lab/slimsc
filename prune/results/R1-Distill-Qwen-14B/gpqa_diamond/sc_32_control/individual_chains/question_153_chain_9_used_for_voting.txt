Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about determining the reactants and major products of three different Michael addition reactions. Each reaction has a different set of starting materials and conditions, and the options give possible products A, B, and C. I need to figure out which option correctly lists all three products.

The first part explains that α-β unsaturated carbonyls are electrophilic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. These can react with nucleophiles, like enolates, in a Michael addition. When a nucleophile attacks the β position, it forms a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate. The specific reaction mentioned is known as the Michael reaction.

Now, let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol).

I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β position of the acceptor, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate group: CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, the structure should be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Hmm. Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a substituent on the double bond. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Oh wait, that's not right. Wait, the numbering: for acrylate, the carbonyl is at position 1, the double bond between 1 and 2. So 3 would be the next carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)(O)OCH3? Wait, that's not correct because the substituent would be on the same carbon as the carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the double bond.

Wait, no, wait, wait. The correct structure should be: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. That doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is a ketone group. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has the p-tolyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So when the enolate attacks, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the β position. Wait, the Michael addition involves the enolate (nucleophile) attacking the β position of the acceptor, which in this case is the CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The acceptor in Michael addition is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the double bond at position 3. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-p-tolyl substituted at the double bond, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

So, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, the enolate is a strong nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate, when treated with a base like NaOEt, will form its enolate. The enolate would attack the β carbon of the acceptor.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when deprotonated, the enolate would be CH- (with negative charge) connected to the two COOCH3 groups. So the enolate would look like CH– (from the malonate) attacking the β position (the CH2 part) of the acceptor.

Wait, the acceptor is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the β position is the CH2 part. The enolate (from malonate) would attack the β carbon (the CH2), adding to it, connecting the two molecules.

So the addition would be: the enolate (CH–) attacks the CH2 part of the acrylate, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's enolate and the acrylate's β carbon.

So the product would be a molecule where the malonate has added to the acrylate. Let me try to imagine the structure. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate has two COOCH3 groups attached to a central CH– group. When it attacks, the CH– adds to the CH2, so the product would be a longer chain.

So the product would be something like CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3 connected to the malonate-derived part. Wait, perhaps the product would be a tricarboxylate. Let me think: when the enolate attacks, the structure would form a new carbon chain. So perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, let me visualize this. The enolate is the conjugate base of dimethyl malonate, which is (CH2(COOCH3)2)–. When it attacks the β carbon of the acrylate, which is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, the attack would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the acrylate's β carbon.

So the resulting molecule would have the structure where the malonate's CH– connects to the CH2 (but now that CH2 becomes CH–, since the bond is formed). The product would be a tricarboxylate ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a longer chain with two ester groups from the malonate and one from the acrylate. So the formula would be something like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a central CH2-C(CH2...), but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I should think about the actual product structure.

Wait, another approach: The Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to an α,β-unsaturated ester typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the product would be a substituted malonate.

In this case, the acceptor is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the product would be a trimethyl ester, maybe something like trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, option A and B have A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Option C and D have A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. So I'm thinking A is correct.

Moving on to Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in MeOH with H3O+.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine sounds like a cyclic enamine. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring, and substituting one of the carbons with a cyclohexene group. So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring attached to the piperidine at position 1.

Wait, but more accurately, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would have a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with a double bond starting at position 1) attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is a substituent on the piperidine ring. Wait, the position is 1, so maybe the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen?

Wait, perhaps the structure is a piperidine ring where one of the carbons (say, position 1) is connected to a cyclohexene ring via a single bond. So the structure would be a piperidine ring with a cyclohexenyl group attached.

But wait, the key point is that this compound is an enamine, which can act as a Michael donor. The (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor in this case. So the Michael addition would involve the enamine attacking the β position of the enenitrile.

Wait, let me think about the structures. The enamine would have a conjugated system, allowing the lone pair on the nitrogen to conjugate with the double bond, making the alpha carbon (relative to the double bond) a good nucleophile. So the enamine would attack the β position of the acceptor.

But wait, the acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-CN. The β position is the CH2 group. So the enamine would attack the CH2 group, adding across the double bond.

Wait, but wait. The Michael addition is a 1,4-addition. The enamine (as a nucleophile) would attack the β carbon of the acceptor.

Wait, but in this case, the acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile: CH2=CH-CN. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if butenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait: but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2-CN, but wait, butenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN.

So in this case, the β position is the CH2 group adjacent to the nitrile. So the enamine's nucleophilic site (probably a carbon adjacent to the nitrogen) would attack that CH2.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. The enamine is a conjugated system: the piperidine ring is connected to a cyclohexene group, which is conjugated with the lone pair on the nitrogen.

Upon attack, the enamine's alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrogen) attacks the β position of the acceptor. So the attack would occur on the CH2 group of the but-2-enenitrile.

After the attack, the double bond would shift to form a new single bond, and the enamine would add to the acceptor, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but wait. The addition would form a new bond between the enamine's alpha carbon and the acceptor's β carbon (CH2 group). So the product would have a new carbon chain.

Let me try to imagine the structure. The enamine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. When it attacks the CH2 in CH2=CHCH2CN, the attack would form a new bond between the enamine's carbon and the CH2, breaking the double bond and forming a new single bond. The product would then have a new substituent, the cyclohexenyl-piperidine attached to the CH2, and the nitrile group.

Wait, but considering the mechanism, the addition of the enamine would add to the acceptor, leading to a new carbon chain. The product would be a nitrile with a longer chain attached, incorporating the enamine's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the options for B are:

Option A: B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Option C: B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, in the reaction, after the Michael addition, the product would have a new substituent from the enamine. But since the conditions are MeOH and H3O+ (acid), perhaps there's an acid workup involved, which could lead to the formation of a ketone or an alcohol.

Wait, the enamine would add to the acceptor, and then hydrolysis could occur under acidic conditions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary amine or something else. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again.

When the enamine attacks, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond. So the enamine's structure would add to the acceptor. The resulting intermediate would have a new bond, and perhaps after the addition, there's a tautomerization or ring opening.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about another approach. The piperidine ring is connected to a cyclohexene. When it undergoes Michael addition to the enenitrile, the product would have the cyclohexenyl group attached to the carbon where the attack occurred.

In the enenitrile (CH2=CHCH2CN), the enamine's alpha carbon would attack the β carbon (the CH2) of the enenitrile. So the product would have a new bond between the enamine's carbon and the CH2, making the structure CH2-CH-CH2CN connected to the enamine.

Wait, but the enamine is part of a ring. So the product would be something like CH2-CH(Cyclohexenyl-piperidine)-CH2CN, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the options suggest the product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. So perhaps the product is a butanenitrile with a substituent at the 3 position.

Wait, but the nitrene would be at the end. So perhaps the product is (3-cyclohexenyl-piperidinyl)butanenitrile. Hmm, I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the type of reaction. The enamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the acceptor's β position. After the attack, the product would have the enamine's structure attached to the acceptor, but perhaps under acidic conditions, there's a ring opening or a change in the substituent.

Wait, but the product's options for B are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile would imply a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (oxo) group at position 2, attached to the third carbon of butanenitrile.

Alternatively, 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile would have a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 2, attached to the third carbon.

But I'm not quite getting how the reaction leads to this product. Maybe I should think about the regiochemistry of the addition.

Wait, perhaps when the enamine attacks, the cyclohexene ring becomes saturated, leading to a cyclohexane ring. Then, under acidic conditions, the enamine could hydrolyze, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Michael addition leads to the formation of a conjugate addition product, which upon protonation and workup gives the major product.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should move on to Reaction (C) and see if that helps.

Reaction (C): C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the question is what are the reactants? The given reaction is C + but-3-en-2-one under KOH and H2O to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So I need to find what C is.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That suggests that the product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione (two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3) with a 3-oxobutyl group attached at position 2.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-Cyclohexane-1,3-dione (positions 1 and 3 have ketones), and at position 2, there's a CH2CH2CO group, but wait, 3-oxobutyl is CH2CH2COCH3? Or CH2CHCO- ?

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(H)C(O)CH3. So it's an α,β-unsaturated ketone: CH2=CH-C(O)CH3.

Wait, no, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's not possible for a four-carbon chain. Wait, but butenone has four carbons. Structure of but-3-en-2-one: numbering from the ketone, the carbonyl is at position 2. So the structure would be CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? Wait, no, because but-3-en-2-one would imply the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that's beyond the ketone. Hmm, perhaps I got the structure wrong.

Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2CH2COCH3, but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-COCH3.

Wait, but that's 3-buten-2-one. Because the double bond is between C2 and C3. So but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-COCH3.

So, in the reaction, when this reacts with C under basic conditions (KOH, H2O), the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So perhaps C is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Because when but-3-en-2-one (CH2=CH-COCH3) undergoes a Michael addition with a cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate, the product would be the cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent added.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3-dione has two ketone groups, and under basic conditions, it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one), leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, for example, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the β carbon (the CH2 part) of the butenone, leading to the addition of the cyclohexane ring to the butenone.

The product would then have the cyclohexane-1,3-dione connected to the butenone-derived structure.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That suggests that the butenone's carbonyl group (COCH3) is connected to the cyclohexane at position 2, and the butenone's double bond has been attacked, leading to the formation of a new substituent.

So, in the product, the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

Wait, the substituent is 3-oxobutyl, which is -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3. So the cyclohexane-1,3-dione (positions 1 and 3) would have at position 2 a chain -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

But how does this form from the reaction?

Looking back, the reaction is C + but-3-en-2-one with KOH and H2O to give the product. So C is likely the enolate's source, which would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Because when deprotonated, it forms an enolate which attacks the β position of the butenone.

So the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Therefore, C should be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Looking at the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Option C also says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Option D says C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would be a dihydroxy structure, but under basic conditions, I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but in the options, which have C as what?

Looking at the options:

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So our conclusion is that C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So in the options, B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Now, let's tie this back to the earlier reactions.

Looking at the options for the overall problem:

Option A) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B) A = same, B= same, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D) A = same as C, B=same as C, C= 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But we concluded that C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so options B and C have this. So let's look at the other parts.

For Reaction (A), we thought A was trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So options A and B have that for A.

Reaction (B) is the one I was stuck on earlier. The product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Given that the reaction is done in MeOH with H3O+ (acidic conditions), perhaps the product is the nitrile with a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the enamine addition would form a new carbon-nitrogen bond. Wait, the enamine's structure would have a conjugated system, so when the enamine attacks, it adds to the acceptor, and then after workup, perhaps a ring is formed or a substituent is added.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, implying that the cyclohexene ring is now a cyclohexane with a ketone (oxo) group. So perhaps the ring becomes saturated and an oxo group is formed.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, the product may undergo some tautomerism or ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrile with a cyclohexane ring substituted at the 2-position as an oxo group.

Wait, considering that the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, the cyclohexene ring would be part of the enamine. After the addition, the ring might open or form a new structure.

But I'm not entirely confident here. Looking at the options, if A is correct (trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)...), then in options A and B, B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Alternatively, in options C and D, B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

But given that the reaction is in MeOH with H3O+ (acidic), perhaps the enamine is protonated, making the alpha carbon available for attack. Once the attack occurs, the product would have the enamine's structure attached, and under acidic conditions, any rings would remain as they are or perhaps form an oxo group.

Wait, maybe the enamine attack leads to the formation of a new ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So option B.

So, putting this together:

Reaction (A) produces A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Reaction (B) produces B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Reaction (C) produces C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option B says A = trimethyl..., B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)..., C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So option B matches these conclusions.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the reactants and major products of three Michael addition reactions. Each reaction has distinct starting materials and conditions, and the options provide possible products for each reaction. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Reaction (A): Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-Tolyl)Acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH
- Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor, forming an enolate under basic conditions. This enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.
- The product is a resonance-stabilized intermediate, specifically a trimethyl ester with the structure **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.
- This matches the description in **Option A** and **Option B**.

### Reaction (B): 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)Piperidine + (E)-But-2-Enenitrile with MeOH and H₃O⁺
- 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as a nucleophile due to its enamine structure. It attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.
- Under acidic conditions (H₃O⁺), the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexene ring becomes saturated, and a ketone group forms at position 2.
- This matches the description in **Option A** and **Option B**.

### Reaction (C): C + But-3-En-2-One with KOH and H₂O
- The product is given as **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which suggests that the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione reacts with but-3-en-2-one (an α,β-unsaturated ketone) in a Michael addition.
- The enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, forming the product. Thus, the starting material **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.
- This matches the description in **Option B** and **Option C**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results for all three reactions:
- Reaction (A): **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**
- Reaction (B): **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**
- Reaction (C): **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**

These correspond to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
