Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if the period is shorter, that means Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star because orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since M is much larger than m (planet mass), it's approximated as P² proportional to a³/(M). So a planet with a shorter period is closer in.

The stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but they end up with the same radius. So, same radius, but different masses. Wait, higher mass stars are generally larger, but in this case, they have the same radius despite Planet_1's star being more massive. Maybe because Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something, but I don't think that affects the probability calculation directly.

The main thing here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula is roughly R_planet / R_star, but more accurately, it's (R_p + R_s) / a, but actually, I think the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (a / R_s), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s) / a. No, wait, no. The probability that a planet transits is given by the ratio of the size of the star to the distance of the planet's orbit, but actually, it's more precise. Oh wait, the probability is approximately (R_*/ a), where R_* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view, which is a small area relative to the sky. So the probability is (R_*/a), right? Because if the orbital plane is edge-on, the chance of transit is higher, and the probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance. So P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximated as R_* / a.

Wait, no, actually, the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by something else? Or is it just (R_* / a) * something else? Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit that would cause a transit. For an edge-on orbit, the planet has to pass directly in front. The probability is more accurately (R_* / a), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, and the inclination. Wait, no, the probability is also influenced by the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. Because the chance of the orbit being edge-on is (R_*/a) multiplied by some factor. Wait, actually, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller, it's approximately (R_* / a). So yes, P ≈ (R_* / a).

Wait, but let's make sure. The probability of a transit is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. So for a star of radius R_*, the area where the planet would cause a transit is a circle with radius R_* on the sky. The total possible area for the planet's orbital plane is proportional to a². So the probability is (R_*²) / (a²) * (something else?), but wait, actually, the probability is (R_*) / a multiplied by (the chance that the planet's orbital inclination is just right). Hmm, maybe I should refer to the formula I remember.

Wait, here's a better approach. The transit probability (P) is given by:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 + (a / R_* )) )

Wait, no, perhaps not. Another approach: the probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter (as viewed edge-on). Wait, I think the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by a factor related to the relative sizes. Alternatively, the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by something involving the planet's size, but since the planets are Earth-like, their size is much smaller than the stars, so R_p is negligible compared to R_*, so P ≈ (R_* / a).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (some function of the orbital distance and star radius). Let me think of it this way: the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. The chance that our line of sight is within the plane of the orbit (i.e., the inclination is 90 degrees) is 1/(a/R_*). No, that's not right.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by (R_* + R_p) / a, but R_p is negligible, so it's approximately R_* / a. So P ≈ R_* / a.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. But if the orbit is circular, a is the orbital radius.

So, the probability for each planet to transit is P1 = R_*1 / a1 and P2 = R_*2 / a2.

But wait, the question states that both stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2 = R_*.

So P1 = R_* / a1 and P2 = R_* / a2. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is (R_*/a2)/(R_*/a1) = a1/a2.

Wait, no, because P2 = [R_* / a2], and P1 = [R_* / a1]. So P2/P1 = (R_*/a2) / (R_*/a1) ) = a1/a2.

Wait, but what's a1 and a2? a is the semi-major axis, which can be found from the orbital period using Kepler's third law.

We can write Kepler's third law as P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. Since both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, the planet mass is negligible compared to the star. So M_1 is twice M_2.

So for Planet_1: P1 = (P_1)^2 = (4π²/G M_1) a1³.

Similarly, for Planet_2: (P2)^2 = (4π²/G M_2) a2³.

But wait, the question says that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So P1 = P_2 /3.

Wait, no, if Planet_1 has period P1, and Planet_2 has P2, then P1 = P2 /3. So P1 is shorter.

Wait, no, the question says, "orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P1 = (1/3) * P2.

So, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2/3.

Now, using Kepler's third law, which says P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). For each planet, we can relate a and P to the mass of the star.

So for Planet_1: P1² = (4π² a1³)/(G M1).

For Planet_2: P2² = (4π² a2³)/(G M2).

Dividing these two equations:

( P1² / P2² ) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * ( M2 / M1 )

Because M1 is twice M2, so M2 = M1/2.

So,

( (P1/P2)^2 ) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * ( (M1/2) / M1 ) )

Simplify:

( (P1/P2)^2 ) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * (1/2 )

We know that P1 = P2/3 → P1/P2 = 1/3.

So,

( (1/3)^2 ) = ( a1³ / a2³ ) * (1/2 )

→ 1/9 = (a1³/a2³) * (1/2)

Multiply both sides by 2:

2/9 = a1³/a2³

Take cube roots:

(2/9)^(1/3) = a1/a2.

Let me compute that. 2 is about 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 ≈ 0.222.

The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6³ = 0.216), so a1/a2 ≈ 0.6.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Cube root of 2/9.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.603.

So a1 ≈ 0.603 a2.

So a2 is about 1.658 a1.

Wait, no, wait, because a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

Wait, no, wait, the equation was (2/9) = (a1/a2)^3.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.603.

So a1 = 0.603 a2.

Which implies a2 = a1 / 0.603 ≈ 1.658 a1.

So a2 is about 1.658 times a1.

Wait, but let's think about what a is. a is the semi-major axis, so the orbital distance.

So, since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But transit probability is P = R_* / a.

Since both stars have the same R_*, R_1 = R_2.

Therefore, P1 = R_* / a1.

P2 = R_* / a2.

So the ratio P2/P1 = a1/a2.

Wait, because P2 = R_* / a2, P1 = R_* / a1 → P2/P1 = (R_* / a2) / (R_* / a1) ) = a1/a2.

We found that a1/a2 ≈ 0.603 → so P2/P1 ≈ 0.603.

So P2 is about 0.6 times P1. So P1 is higher.

Wait, but wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a1 is smaller, so R_*/a1 is larger, so P1 is larger.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so the researchers should observe Planet_1.

But let's compute the exact ratio.

From Kepler's law: (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (a1^3 / a2^3) * (M2 / M1)

We have P1 = P2/3, M1 = 2 M2.

So,

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3/a2^3) * (M2)/(2 M2)

Simplify:

( (1/9) P2^2 ) / P2^2) ) = (a1^3/a2^3) * (1/2)

→ (1/9) = (a1^3/a2^3) * (1/2)

Multiply both sides by 2:

2/9 = a1^3/a2^3 → (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.603.

So a1 = 0.603 a2.

So, a2 = a1 / 0.603 ≈ 1.658 a1.

So, P1 = R_* / a1.

P2 = R_* / a2 = R_* / (1.658 a1 ) = (1/1.658) * (R_*/a1 ) ≈ 0.603 * P1.

So P1 is about 1.658 times P2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

If a2 = 1.658 a1, then P2 = R_* / a2 = (R_*)/(1.658 a1 ) = (1/1.658) * (R_* /a1 ) = (1/1.658) * P1.

So P2 is approximately 0.603 P1.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.658 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, wait, no, because P2 = 0.603 P1 → P1 is 1.658 times P2.

Wait, no, let's calculate the ratio P1/P2.

P1 = R_* / a1.

P2 = R_* / a2.

So P1/P2 = (R_* / a1 ) / ( R_* / a2 ) ) = a2/a1.

Because a1 = 0.603 a2 → a2 = 1.658 a1.

So a2/a1 = 1.658.

Therefore, P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.658 → P1 is 1.658 times higher than P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But wait, that's in terms of the ratio. So Planet_1 is preferred because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D is 2.7 times.

So according to our calculation, it's approximately 1.65 times higher. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the ratio.

Because a1/a2 is 0.603 → a2 = a1/0.603 ≈ 1.658 a1.

So P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2 = R*/(1.658 a1 ) → P2 = P1 * (1/1.658) ≈ 0.603 P1.

So P1 is 1.658 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the researchers prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C is 'Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.'

So the correct answer should be C.

The question involves determining which of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star, based on their orbital periods, the masses of their host stars, and the stars' radii. Both planets have the same mass, and their host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's, meaning it orbits closer to its star.

The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A shorter \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star, we relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets. Let \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) be the orbital periods of Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively, and \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) be the masses of their host stars. From the problem, \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Substituting these into Kepler's law:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
\]

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.603.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.603a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. The ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.603} \approx 1.658.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2, making it the preferred target for observation.

Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
