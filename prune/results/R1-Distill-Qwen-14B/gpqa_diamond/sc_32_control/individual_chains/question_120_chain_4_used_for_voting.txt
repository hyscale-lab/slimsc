Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says, "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?" And then there are four options: A to D, each with a different power of 1 over plx.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is approximately 1/plx parsecs. So a larger plx means a closer star because the parallax decreases with distance.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think I'm looking for a function N(plx) which tells me how many stars are in a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. Or wait, maybe it's per unit of parallax? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's like, for each small change in parallax dplx, how many stars are there? Or perhaps it's the number density in the plx space. Hmm.

Wait, I should think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So number density n(r) is constant, so the number of stars in a sphere of radius r is proportional to r^3. But how does that translate to parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's think about the volume element in terms of distance. The volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, let me express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, dd would be -d (plx)^2 dplx, because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, maybe I should compute it properly.

Let me substitute: d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d dplx)/d plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the change in d is negative, but in terms of the volume, it's positive. So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π d² dd. But dd is - (1/plx²) dplx, so substituting:

Volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) [since dd = - (1/plx²) dplx, but we take the absolute value for volume]. Wait, wait: no, the volume element between plx and plx + dplx is 4π (d)^2 (dd), and d is 1/plx. So:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx + dplx)^2) ? No, wait, no. Wait, in terms of plx, the volume element becomes:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d (plx) ) * dplx.

Wait, the derivative of d with respect to plx is d/dd = (d plx)/dd = -1/(d^2) = - (plx)^2. So dd = - plx² dplx.

So the volume element in plx is:

dV = 4π (d)^2 dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 ( - plx² dplx ) = 4π (1/plx²) (- plx²) dplx.

Wait, that gives dV = -4π dplx. Wait, that can't be right because it would imply the volume element is just -4π dplx, which is independent of plx. That seems off. What did I miss here?

Wait, perhaps I should approach it more carefully. Let's express the volume element in terms of plx.

We have d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical shells is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, we can write dd in terms of dplx.

So, dd = (d dplx) / (d plx) ) → but wait, the derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/d plx = -1/(plx²). So, d d = (dd/d plx) d plx = (-1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting into dV:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) d plx.

Wait, that's 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) d plx = -4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But since dV is positive (volume can't be negative), we take the absolute value, so dV = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but that's the differential volume element in terms of plx. So the number of stars in that volume is n * dV, where n is the number density (number per unit volume).

So the number of stars per unit plx would be N = n * dV/d plx.

Wait, dV/d plx is 4π (1/plx^4), so N = n * (4π / plx^4) ) → so N ∝ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So for each d plx, the number of stars is proportional to d plx multiplied by the number per unit volume and the volume element.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of stars in a given range of plx.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

We have dV = 4π d^2 dd, and d = 1/plx, so substituting, dV =4π (1/plx)^2 (dd). But dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx, so:

dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx^2 d plx ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

But the absolute value is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in the volume element dV is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But the number of stars per unit range of plx is (dN)/(d plx) = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would imply that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit plx increases as 1/plx^4. But that can't be right because, for a uniform distribution, you'd expect more stars at larger distances? Or wait, no. Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so in a given volume, more distant stars have larger volumes. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which I think implies that the number density is uniform in space. So, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV, where n is a constant.

So, if we express the volume element in terms of parallax, then dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 (dd), and dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx, so dV becomes 4π (1/plx²)(-1/plx² d plx) → which is -4π (1/plx^4) d plx. The negative sign is because plx increases as d decreases, but the volume should be positive, so we take the absolute value. So, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Thus, the number of stars in the range plx to plx + d plx would be N = n * (4π / plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is (N) / (d plx) ) = (n * 4π) / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is phrased as "the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's the number N per unit plx, which is (dN)/(d plx). So the function is N ∝ 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, am I confusing number per unit plx with something else? Let me think again. Another approach: if the number of stars per unit volume is n, and the volume per unit plx is dV/d plx = 4π (1/plx^4). So the number per unit plx is n * (4π / plx^4 ), which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d):  
   \[
   \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}
   \]
   Thus, as plx increases, the distance decreases.

2. **Volume Element in Terms of Parallax**: The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \(d\) and thickness \(dd\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is:
   \[
   dV = 4\pi d^2 dd
   \]
   Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we get:
   \[
   dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot dd
   \]
   To express \(dd\) in terms of \(d\text{plx}\), we note:
   \[
   dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}
   \]
   Substituting this into the volume element:
   \[
   dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   dV = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
   \]
   Taking the absolute value (since volume is positive):
   \[
   dV = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
   \]

3. **Number of Stars Per Unit Parallax Range**: The number of stars in the volume element \(dV\) is proportional to the number density \(n\) (constant for a uniform distribution) and \(dV\). Thus:
   \[
   dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
   \]
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore:
   \[
   \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
