Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, I should start by recalling what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for eliminating H-X from haloarenes to form alkenes. But wait, in aromatic compounds, it's more about elimination to form rings with double bonds, like when benzyl halides lose H to form alkenes. But wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, I'm a bit confused. What's the structure here?

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe I misread. Let me think. Oh wait, no, 1-bromobenzene would be bromobenzene, but 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Maybe it's 2,6-dibromobenzene? Or wait, perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene or something else. Wait, the "d" might stand for something else. Wait, maybe it's the notation for deuterium. Like, perhaps it's a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is bromobenzene with a di-substituted arrangement. Wait, perhaps the "d" is a mistake, and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dihydroxybenzene? Not sure. Wait, the question could be about a di-substituted benzene. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Or maybe 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene. Wait, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a benzyl bromide with a deuterium somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for something else, but I'm not catching it. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, or 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions regardless.

Wait, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. So that's a dehydrohalogenation condition. So for benzene rings, when we have a halogen and a hydrogen adjacent, we can lose HX to form a double bond. So for a benzene ring with substituents, the base would abstract a proton that's adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond, thereby forming an aromatic ring with a double bond (like a diene or another substitution pattern). So the product would be an aromatic diene, perhaps.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So maybe the structure is bromobenzene with a substituent on the adjacent carbon. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is bromine. Position 2—what's there? Maybe a methyl group? Or perhaps it's 2,4-dimethyl, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the "d" is a typo and it's 2,4-dimethyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromomethylbenzene. But when treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it would abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2, or positions 1 and 3, depending on the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the possible elimination products. So let's imagine the structure: a benzene ring where position 1 has a Br and position 2 has a substituent, say a CH2 group, or perhaps it's a methyl group. Wait, but without knowing exactly what's at position 2, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a hydrogen, but that might not make sense for elimination.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the "d" is a deuterium, so position 2 has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen. So the structure is bromine at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. But in that case, would the base abstract the deuterium? Unlikely, since deuterium is less acidic than regular H. So perhaps the base would abstract a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br, say position 3, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2? Or perhaps if the substituent is in position 3, leading to a different outcome.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, which would eliminate HBr and form a double bond. The number of possible products depends on how many different positions the H can be abstracted from that are adjacent to the Br.

Wait, for elimination to occur, the H must be on a carbon adjacent to the Br. So if the Br is on position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So if the H is abstracted from position 2 or 6, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, in benzene, each carbon is adjacent to two others. So if the Br is at position 1, the adjacent are 2 and 6. So when the base abstracts a proton from either 2 or 6, elimination would occur, leading to the formation of a double bond between 1-2 or 1-6. But wait, in benzene, these positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So would the products be the same?

Wait, no, because the substituent's position would matter. Wait, but in the starting molecule, perhaps there's a substituent at position 2. Wait, going back to the original compound: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe it's benzene with Br at 1 and a deuterium at 2.

So, the structure is a benzene ring where position 1 has Br, position 2 has D (deuterium), and the rest are Hs or other substituents? Or perhaps it's 2,4-dimethyl, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, the position of that H would determine where the double bond forms.

But in benzene, elimination would form a diene. Wait, but wait, benzene is already a conjugated ring. So elimination would form a ring with an additional double bond, leading to a diene structure. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with one double bond, but that's impossible because benzene is already aromatic. Wait, no, maybe it's forming a substituted benzene with an exocyclic double bond, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for a benzyl bromide, which is a six-membered ring with a CH2Br group. Wait, no, that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromobenzene, which is simply bromobenzene. So, if we treat bromobenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia, what happens? Wait, I thought bromobenzene isn't usually reactive towards elimination because the ring's stability doesn't easily allow for dehydrohalogenation. But wait, maybe under certain conditions, it can eliminate.

Wait, in the case of toluene derivatives, like benzyl bromide (CH2Br-C6H5), elimination would form a double bond between the benzene ring and the adjacent CH2, giving styrene. But that's a different structure. But in bromobenzene, there's no CH2 group attached to the Br; it's directly attached to the ring.

So, perhaps the starting material is not bromobenzene but a different compound. Let's think again.

Wait, the question says "1-bromobenzene-2-d". Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, would it abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Br to form a double bond.

But in that case, since Br is at position 1 and D at position 2, the adjacent Hs would be on positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has D, which is not abstractable. So the base would abstract from position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6? Or perhaps between 1 and 2, but the D is there. Wait, but if position 2 is D, the base can't abstract that. So the only possible H is at position 6.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is bromine at position 1, and a methyl group at position 2. So, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So when NaNH2 is added, it would abstract a proton from either the adjacent positions to Br. So in this case, the protons at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but position 2 is a methyl group, so the H's would be on the methyl. So the methyl is at position 2, so the adjacent positions are 1 (Br), and 3. Wait, no, the methyl is at 2, so the adjacent carbons are 1 (Br) and 3. So the H's that are β to Br would be on the methyl group, i.e., the CH3 at position 2. So, the base would abstract a proton from the methyl group at position 2, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group (which is attached to position 2), then elimination would form a double bond between position 1 (Br) and position 2. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with an exocyclic double bond. For example, if the Br is at position 1 and a methyl at position 2, then elimination of HBr would form a double bond between position 1 and 2, making a structure like styrene but attached to the ring. Wait, but styrene is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So perhaps the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group that's now a double bond, but that would require the adjacent structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between carbon 1 and 2. But since the ring is already conjugated, adding another double bond would make it more like a diene. Wait, but benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Adding another double bond would make it a 1,3-diene or something else?

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1, and a substituent (like methyl) at position 2.

So, structure:

Positions are 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 3 (H), 4 (H), 5 (H), 6 (H).

When NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a β hydrogen, which would be from either position 2 (if possible) or another position adjacent to Br. But wait, position 1 is Br, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So the β hydrogens would be on the same carbon as the adjacent positions. Hmm, not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a CH3 group. So, the CH3 is at position 2. The adjacent carbon to Br is position 2, which has CH3. So, the β hydrogen would be on the CH3 group. So, the base can abstract one of the hydrogens from the CH3, leading to the formation of a double bond between position 1 and 2.

Wait, but that would form a double bond between the benzene ring's position 1 and the adjacent CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense because the CH3 would become CH2- after losing H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the loss of H from the CH2 group adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of an alkene. So, if the CH3 is at position 2, perhaps there's a CH2Br group there. Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-phenylethane or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about what NaNH2 in ammonia typically does. It's a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in the formation of alkenes from haloalkanes. For example, in the E2 elimination mechanism, the base abstracts a proton that's anti to the leaving group (Br in this case), leading to the formation of a double bond.

In aromatic compounds, elimination could form an aromatic diene. For example, if the structure is such that the Br is on a carbon adjacent to another substituent that has a hydrogen, elimination would form a double bond between those two positions.

Wait, but in the case where the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps the structure is such that the Br is at position 1 and the substituent is a methyl group at position 2. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 2's methyl group, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

But wait, wait, how would that work? The methyl group is attached to the benzene ring at position 2. If the methyl has a hydrogen that's adjacent to the Br (since position 1 and 2 are adjacent), then elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that would require the methyl to lose a hydrogen and the Br to leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but the benzene ring has double bonds already. So adding another double bond would require some restructuring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about the benzene ring itself but about a substituent on it. For example, if there's a CH2Br group attached to the benzene ring, then elimination would form a double bond between the benzene and the CH2, leading to a vinyl group. But in that case, the starting material would be something like benzyl bromide, not bromobenzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is Br and another is a group that can undergo elimination.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, the base would abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

So the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group between positions 1 and 2, forming a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds, so adding another double bond might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a cumulene or another structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 1,2-diene benzene? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a benzene ring with an exocyclic double bond, like styrene, where the double bond is between the benzene ring and a neighboring carbon.

Wait, but in styrene, the structure is benzene with a vinyl group (CH2=CH2 attached). But in this case, the elimination would involve the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's imagine the molecule as a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and another substituent (like a methyl group) at position 2. When the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group adjacent to the Br, elimination occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would be part of the ring, which is already all double bonds. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not a methyl but something else. Maybe it's a CH2Br group, but that's not what the starting material says.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of an aromatic diene. So, for example, if the Br is at position 1 and the substituent is at position 2, elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, leading to a 1,2-diene structure on the benzene ring. But wait, benzene already has three double bonds, so adding another would make it 1,2,3,4,5,6 all double bonds, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't occur on the ring itself but on a substituent attached to the ring. For example, if the substituent is a CH2Br, then elimination would form a double bond in the substituent, leading to a benzene ring with a vinyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which perhaps is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the structure is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. The rest are H's.

In that case, the base NaNH2 would abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Br. But in this structure, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, which isn't abstractable. So the only possible H is at position 6.

So the base abstracts the H at position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, in benzene, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So that would form a double bond between 1 and 6, but the ring already has double bonds. Hmm, maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a diene somewhere else on the ring. Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the elimination of HBr from a di-substituted benzene, leading to a diene elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene. So, when the base abstracts a H from either the methyl at 2 or 3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the possibility of forming multiple isomers due to different positions of elimination.

Wait, another approach: in a benzene ring, when elimination occurs, the product is a bicyclic compound or another aromatic structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromobenzene, and after elimination, it forms a benzene with a double bond somewhere else. But that doesn't make sense because benzene is already fully conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is not benzene but a derivative where elimination is possible. For example, a benzyl bromide would eliminate to form a double bond, but the question is about bromobenzene.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think differently. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So the reaction is likely an elimination, E2 mechanism, leading to the loss of HBr and formation of a double bond.

Now, the starting material has Br at position 1 and a substituent at position 2 (the "d" could be a substituent, perhaps a deuterium). So, if the substituent at position 2 allows for a hydrogen adjacent to Br, elimination can occur, forming a double bond.

So, how many different ways can the double bond form?

If the substituent at position 2 is such that there are two different sites for the elimination (e.g., two different H's that can be abstracted leading to different products), then there would be multiple products.

Wait, but if the substituent is a single group, like a methyl, perhaps the elimination would form only one product, because the H's on the methyl are equivalent.

Alternatively, if the substituent is such that multiple H's are available for abstraction, leading to different stereochemical outcomes, but in this case, since it's a symmetric position, perhaps only one product forms.

Wait, but in the case where the base can abstract a H from either side of the substituent, leading to different products, but if the substituent is symmetric, perhaps the products are the same.

Alternatively, if the substituent is such that there are multiple possible positions for elimination, leading to different regioisomers.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene with Br at 1 and CH2 at 2. So, the base could abstract a H from the CH2 group, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

But then, the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group that's now a CH with a double bond to the ring. But that would make it a vinyl group attached to the ring, which would be a styrene-like structure.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that's part of the ring, which is already fully conjugated. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of an example. Take toluene bromide, say CH3-C6H4-Br. When treated with NaNH2, it would eliminate HBr and form a double bond between the benzene ring and the CH2 group, giving a styrene derivative.

But in the case of bromobenzene, there's no CH2 group; the Br is directly attached to the ring. So elimination isn't possible in the same way because there's no adjacent CH2 group to lose a hydrogen from.

Wait, but then why would the reaction proceed? Perhaps the starting material isn't bromobenzene but another compound. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So, the structure is bromine at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.

In that case, the CH3 group is attached to position 2, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. The base can abstract a hydrogen from the CH3 group, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

But wait, that would create a double bond between the benzene ring's position 1 and the adjacent CH2 group. But CH2 isn't directly attached to the ring in this scenario. Hmm, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond in the ring, making it a diene, but that would require rearrangement of the ring's structure, which seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product is a diene, like 1,3-diene. But how would that form from 1-bromobenzene-2-d?

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is in a position that allows for the formation of two different regioisomers.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. If the starting material allows for two different sites for elimination, leading to two different products, then the number of possible products would be two.

But if only one site is possible, then only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products based on the position of the substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for a pattern or another approach.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible products depends on the number of different β hydrogens available for elimination.

If the starting molecule has two different β hydrogens, then two products form. If all β hydrogens are equivalent, then only one product forms.

So, in the case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps the substituent at position 2 allows for two different β hydrogens. For example, if the substituent is a CH2 group, then the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, leading to one product. But if the substituent allows for two different H's, like in a CH3 group, then perhaps two different products form.

Wait, but in a CH3 group, all H's are equivalent, so only one product would form. So if the substituent is CH3, then only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that two different H's are available for elimination, leading to two different products.

Wait, another example: suppose the substituent is a CH2CH3 group. Then, the H's on the CH2 could be abstracted from either side, leading to different products.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2Cl, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, but back to the original problem: the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The solvent is condensed ammonia, and the reagent is NaNH2.

Assuming that the substituent at position 2 is such that there are two different H's available for elimination, then two products would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a di-substituted group, leading to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a deuterium. So, the structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Then, the adjacent H's are at position 6 and perhaps others.

But wait, in that case, the H's at position 6 would be adjacent to Br at position 1. So, the base could abstract the H at position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

But in the benzene ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, so forming a double bond there would be part of the ring's existing structure. That doesn't seem possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a new double bond outside the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, or perhaps I'm missing something about the structure.

Another thought: perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, substituents at positions 2 and 4 are methyl groups. When treated with NaNH2, the base could abstract a H from either the methyl group at position 2 or the methyl group at position 4, leading to two different elimination products. So the number of products would be two.

But wait, let me think. If the Br is at position 1, and methyl groups are at 2 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Br. So, the H's on the methyl at 2 are β hydrogens. Similarly, the H's on the methyl at 6 (but wait, position 4 is across, so perhaps not adjacent). Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So, the Br is at position 1, methyl at 2 and 6.

In that case, the base could abstract H's from either of the methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, each leading to elimination and formation of a double bond at 1-2 or 1-6. But in benzene, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1, so elimination from either would give similar products.

But wait, if the substituents are at 2 and 6, then the elimination could form two different double bonds. But given the symmetry of the benzene ring, would these products be the same or different?

If the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, both methyl groups, then the elimination from either would lead to the same product, because the ring is symmetric. So only one product would form.

But if the substituents are different, then two products would form.

But the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, perhaps the substituent at 2 is a single group, making the elimination from that position possible in only one way, leading to one product.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is one product. So the option is B.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle.

In the reaction, NaNH2 is a strong base, which deprotonates a β hydrogen, leading to E2 elimination. The number of products depends on the number of distinct β hydrogens available.

In a benzene ring with substituents, the β hydrogens may be in different environments, leading to multiple products.

For example, if the substituent is such that there are two distinct β hydrogens, then two products form.

Alternatively, if all β hydrogens are equivalent, then only one product forms.

So, in the case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d, if the substituent at position 2 is such that the β hydrogens are in equivalent positions, only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent allows for two different β hydrogens, leading to two products.

Wait, but if the substituent is a single methyl group at position 2, then the β hydrogens are on that methyl group. Since the methyl group is attached to position 2, which is adjacent to the Br at position 1, the H's on the methyl are all equivalent, so only one product forms.

But if the substituent is such that there are two different types of β hydrogens (like in a di-substituted group), then two products would form.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to position 2. So, the structure is benzene with Br at 1 and CH2- at 2. Then, the CH2 could have two H's, but they're equivalent, so only one product forms upon elimination.

But if the substituent is a CH group with different substituents on either side, leading to different H's, then two products would form.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is that only one product forms, so the answer is option B) 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. I might be missing some structural detail here.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base that facilitates dehydrohalogenation via an E2 elimination mechanism. The goal is to determine the number of possible organic products formed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The compound 1-bromobenzene-2-d refers to a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. This leaves positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 with hydrogen atoms.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   NaNH₂ is a strong base that abstracts a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the leaving group, bromine in this case). This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

3. **Possible β-Hydrogens**:  
   - Bromine is at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are positions 2 and 6.  
   - Position 2 has a deuterium atom, which is not abstractable by the base.  
   - Therefore, the only available β-hydrogens are at position 6.

4. **Elimination Process**:  
   - The base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.  
   - This results in a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

5. **Symmetry and Product Formation**:  
   - The benzene ring is symmetric, and the elimination reaction leads to a single product because there is only one set of equivalent β-hydrogens available for abstraction.  
   - No other β-hydrogens are present to form additional products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces only one possible organic product due to the limited availability of β-hydrogens and the symmetry of the benzene ring. 

ANSWER: B
