Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem involves two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to pick the correct reagents from the options given.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I remember some things about nucleophilic additions and maybe some acid-base reactions.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, what's happening here? I think that maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps the CN- is acting as a nucleophile here.

In a typical ketone reaction, the carbonyl group is attacked by a nucleophile. So, maybe the CN- is adding to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when CN- attacks, it would form a cyanohydrin. Oh, right! A cyanohydrin is when a nucleophile adds to a ketone, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So the product would have both an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon.

Looking at the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw its structure: the central carbon (originally the carbonyl carbon) now has an OH, a CN, and two CH3 groups attached. So that makes sense as a cyanohydrin.

Now, under what conditions does this happen? I remember that adding a strong acid might help. The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. So H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4) is often used as a catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option A says A is H3O+, B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about yet.

Wait, but why H3O+? Because in the presence of acid, the carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack more easily. So yes, the first reaction uses an acid catalyst, which is H3O+.

Okay, so A is H3O+. So the possible options are A and B for the first part.

Now the second reaction: the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I think nitriles can be oxidized under certain conditions. What reagents are used for that?

I recall that oxidizing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid usually requires strong oxidizing agents. One common method is using a strong acid, like HCl, in the presence of heat and possibly other conditions. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions might do it.

Wait, another approach is the hydrolysis of nitriles. Normally, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But wait, that typically requires a catalyst and maybe heat.

Wait, but the starting material already has an -OH group on the same carbon as the -CN. So when the nitrile is oxidized, it becomes a -COOH. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is being hydrolyzed. Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic conditions. Let me think. Acidic hydrolysis of nitriles involves adding H2O and H+ to convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.

The reaction would be: R-CN + H2O → R-COOH, probably under acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl (options A and C), CH3COOH (options B and D), or something else.

Wait, let me think about the conditions. For hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the reaction is usually carried out under strongly acidic conditions, often with a catalyst like H2SO4 or HCl. So HCl is a possible option.

Looking at the options, reagent B in option A is HCl. Option C has B as HCl as well. But wait, in the first part, A is H3O+ which is usually HCl, but I'm not sure if that affects anything.

Wait, but the second reaction says that reagent B is used along with H2O. So if B is HCl, then the solution would be acidic. That fits with the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Alternatively, if B were something else, like CH3COOH, would that be enough? Acetic acid is a weaker acid. Maybe not strong enough for this kind of hydrolysis. So perhaps B needs to be a strong acid, like HCl.

So putting it together: in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so either option A or B), and in the second reaction, B is HCl (so either option A or C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → both reactions use H3O+ and HCl. That seems possible.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. Hmm, I don't think NaHSO3 is used for the first reaction. Wait, what's NaHSO3? It's sodium bisulfite. I think that's used in the reduction of ketones, like in the Clemmensen or maybe something else. Or wait, maybe in the hydrolysis of nitriles? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, the first reaction is a ketone reacting with NaCN and reagent A. So if A is H3O+, that makes sense for the cyanohydrin formation. If A were NaHSO3, that's a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid. But I don't recall HSO3^- being a catalyst for that reaction. So perhaps A is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, only options A and B are possible. For the second reaction, B must be HCl if it's an acidic hydrolysis.

Looking at the options, option A has B=HCl, and A=H3O+. That fits both.

Wait, but what about option D? D has A=NaHSO3 and B=CH3COOH. That doesn't seem right because the first reaction probably needs H3O+.

So the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents for each step.

### Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
- Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile.  
- This reaction forms a cyanohydrin, where the CN⁻ adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group.  
- Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst, such as H₃O⁺, to protonate the carbonyl group and facilitate the nucleophilic attack.  
- Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
- The nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).  
- This is a hydrolysis reaction, and nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic conditions.  
- A strong acid like HCl is commonly used for this purpose, making HCl a suitable choice for reagent B.

### Analysis of Options:  
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - This matches the requirements for both reactions: H₃O⁺ for cyanohydrin formation and HCl for nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and unlikely to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group in the second reaction.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, making this option incorrect for the first reaction.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:  
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to **Option A**.
