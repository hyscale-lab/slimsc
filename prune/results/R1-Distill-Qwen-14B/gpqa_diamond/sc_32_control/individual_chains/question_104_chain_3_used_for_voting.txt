Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of the stars. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The star moves back and forth, and this shift is what we detect.

The key formula here is probably the one that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P). Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3)) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a simplified version since the planets' masses are similar to Neptune, which is much smaller than their host stars. So M_p << M_star, which is the Sun's mass. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So maybe I can ignore M_p in the denominator.

Alternatively, I think the formula I remember is:

K = [ ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ]

But I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, another approach is to consider the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the period.

Wait, I think the formula for K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star.

But since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, perhaps the ratio of their K values can be related to the inverse of the square roots of their orbital periods. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the Doppler shift. The observed shift in the spectral line is proportional to the velocity of the star. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

In the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(something) multiplied by some factors.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the relationship between K and P for the same star mass and planet mass.

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star) * (1 - e²) ) ) ]^(1/2) * (1/(P * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, that's getting me confused. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Wait, I remember that for the same star and same planet mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, maybe it's inversely proportional to the cube root.

Wait, let me think about the formula for K in terms of the orbital period.

The formula is:

K = (v) = [ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / [ (c) * ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should find a way to relate K, P, and other factors.

Alternatively, another formula I've come across is:

K = [ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ] * ( (G / (c^3)) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should refer to the formula as per the radial velocity method.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/2) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to write the formula correctly.

The correct formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( (2π) / (c) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And for circular orbits, e=0, so (1 - e²) → 1. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / c )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, in our case, M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant for same M_p and M_star.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But wait, looking at the options, the question is asking for how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1. So the question is P2 / P1 = ?

We can write K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

We have K1 = 5 mA and K2=7 mA. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, because K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait: Let me re-express the earlier relation. Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because if K is smaller, the period is longer. Since K1 is smaller than K2, P1 should be longer than P2. Wait, no, no. Let me think: If K is larger, that would correspond to a smaller period. Because a larger velocity semi-amplitude implies a shorter period, perhaps.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. The star moves more (higher K) if the planet's orbit is tighter (smaller period), because the planet is orbiting more quickly, causing the star to move more in response.

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination, and the orbital period. So for the same mass, if the period is shorter, the star's velocity would be higher because the planet is orbiting faster, so the star's reflex velocity would have to compensate.

Wait, that makes sense. So higher K implies shorter period. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K2 is higher, so P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, that can't be; if P2 is shorter, then P2/P1 would be less than one.

But let me re-examine the question. The question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is longer, then the ratio P2/P1 would be greater than 1. But according to what I thought earlier, higher K implies shorter period, so P2 (with K=7) would have a shorter period than P1 (K=5). So P2/P1 would be less than 1. Hence, the ratio would be the reciprocal, meaning either I messed up the ratio or my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more methodically.

The formula for K for each planet:

K = (v) = [ (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * M_p * sin i ] / [ c * (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula relating K, period, and mass.

Wait, the formula I remember is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi) ) / ( c ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since e is zero for circular orbits and M_p is << M_star, it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( c * M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (2 pi )^(1/3) / P^(1/3)

Which can be written as:

K = ( (2 pi G )/c^3 )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star )^(1/3) / P^(1/3)

So, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star * P ))^(1/3 )

But in this problem, M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Therefore, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because K1 is smaller than K2, the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7.

So,

5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

Which is (125) / (343) = approx 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's shorter. So how many times longer? It's actually shorter, so P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so it's about 36% as long as P1. So P2 is shorter, so it's less than one times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, so the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~ 1.40

C) ~ 1.96

D) ~ 0.85

So the ratio P2 / P1 is ~0.36, so the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times, which is less than one. So P2 is shorter, so the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

K1 =5, K2=7.

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1's period. So P2 is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, how many times longer is it? It's less than once. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). For stars of the same mass and planets of similar mass, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). This can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately \( 0.364 \) times \( P_1 \). This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.

From the options provided:

- **A) ~0.36**: Matches the calculated ratio.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it suggests \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \), which contradicts the data.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it also suggests \( P_2 \) is much longer than \( P_1 \).
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated ratio.

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
