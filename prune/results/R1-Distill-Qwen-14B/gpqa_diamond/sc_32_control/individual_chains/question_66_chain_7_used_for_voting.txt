Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's used when we have new physics beyond the Standard Model, and we write down all possible interactions up to a certain energy scale. These interactions are organized into operators of different dimensions.

Now, the question is about which symmetries all these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me go through each one.

Lorentz symmetry: I think this is a big one. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So any operator in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if it didn't, that would mean the theory isn't consistent with special relativity, which is a fundamental part of our understanding of physics. So I'm pretty sure Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Poincare symmetry: Hmm. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory, and when you write down operators, you usually include terms that are Poincare-invariant. Because if you have terms that aren't invariant under translations, like having a term that depends on position, that's not Lorentz-invariant either. Wait, no. Wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if you have a theory that's Poincare-invariant, it's also Lorentz-invariant. But are all operators in SMEFT Poincare-invariant?

I'm a bit uncertain. I remember that in effective field theories, you can have operators of different types. For instance, operators like dimension 6 terms. But wait, Poincare symmetry requires that the theory is invariant under spacetime translations. That would mean that the action is the same everywhere, which is a given for any relativistic field theory. But wait, the SMEFT includes operators like the Weinberg operator, which is dimension 6, but I don't think that breaks Poincare symmetry. So maybe all operators must respect Poincare symmetry because otherwise, the effective theory wouldn't be a proper relativistic theory.

Wait wait, but wait: the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare is more than that; it's the combination of Lorentz and translations. But in an effective theory, when you write down the Lagrangian, each term must be a scalar under Lorentz, and the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. Oh wait, wait a second. The individual terms (operators) in the Lagrangian are local, so each operator must be a scalar and have the correct transformation properties. But each operator must also be such that when you integrate it over spacetime, the action is invariant under translations. Hmm, but each term in the Lagrangian density must be a scalar, but the Lagrangian is a function that's integrated, so I'm not sure if each operator needs to be Poincare-invariant. Or is it that the entire theory must be Poincare-invariant, meaning that the operators must transform in a way that the whole Lagrangian is invariant. Poincare includes the generators for translations, so perhaps each operator must be invariant under translations as well. Or maybe the operators themselves don't have to be Poincare-invariant, but when you add them to the Lagrangian, the whole is.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry are related. If the operators are Lorentz scalars, then the entire theory is Lorentz-invariant. But for Poincare, you need the action to be invariant under translations as well. But in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Lagrangian is a scalar, so integrating it over spacetime would give an action that's invariant under translations if the Lagrangian is the same everywhere. So perhaps all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but wait. I remember that in some cases, you can have operators that don't respect Poincare symmetry, but that doesn't make sense in an effective theory. Because the effective theory is an expansion of the Standard Model, which is Poincare-invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they must be Lorentz scalars and have terms that are translation-invariant.

So, going back, the first two symmetries, 1 and 2, are both required.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I'm not sure if operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. I think that's not necessarily the case. Because the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry. For example, in the Standard Model, there are CP-violating phases in the CKM matrix. So if the SMEFT includes operators beyond the Standard Model, some of which could violate CP, then operators in SMEFT might not need to respect CP symmetry. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is incorrect.

Then, CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. That is, any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT-symmetric. So if all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, then they must automatically respect CPT symmetry. Wait, but is that right? Because CPT is a combination of these operations, but for a theory to have Lorentz symmetry, it must also have CPT symmetry. So the SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must have operators that respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but operators are part of the Lagrangian. If the Lagrangian is Lorentz-invariant, then the theory must have CPT symmetry. Because in QFT, CPT symmetry is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry. So any operator respecting Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So, putting it all together.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected. Yes.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Since operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Poincare is a subset, I think they must respect Poincare as well. So yes.

3. CP Symmetry: Not necessarily. So no.

4. CPT Symmetry: Yes, because it's required by Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Are all operators in SMEFT respecting Poincare symmetry? Because the Poincare group includes both translations and Lorentz transformations. If the operators are scalars, then the theory is Lorentz-invariant. But for translations, the theory is invariant under shifting the coordinates, which is the case if the Lagrangian is the same everywhere. So the individual operators, when put into the Lagrangian, make the entire thing translation-invariant. So each operator itself doesn't need to be translation-invariant, but the Lagrangian must be. But in SMEFT, the operators are all local, so each operator is a function at a point, and when you integrate them, the action is invariant under translations. So individual operators don't need to be Poincare scalars beyond being Lorentz scalars. So maybe Poincare symmetry isn't a condition that each operator must satisfy, but the overall theory does. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the operators themselves must be invariant under these symmetries, or the theory as a whole must be. I think the question is about the operators in the theory respecting the symmetry, meaning that each operator is invariant under that symmetry.

Wait, for example, a Lorentz scalar operator is an operator that transforms as a scalar under Lorentz transformations. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. Similarly, for Poincare, each term must be invariant under Poincare transformations, which would include being a Lorentz scalar and also invariant under translations. But wait, how can an operator be invariant under translations? Because translation invariance is about the theory being the same everywhere. So perhaps the operators don't have to be translation-invariant themselves, but when you construct the Lagrangian, the sum of operators must be translation-invariant. Because each operator is local, they are functions at a point, so each operator doesn't need to be translation-invariant. So perhaps the individual operators do not need to be Poincare-invariant, but the entire Lagrangian (which is the sum of operators) must be.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator isn't a Poincare scalar, it would break Poincare symmetry. But I think each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so they are Poincare invariance in that sense. Wait, no. Because Poincare includes translations. For example, a term like ∂μ φ would transform under translations because the derivative involves the position. No, wait, the operator ∂μ φ is a scalar under Lorentz but not under translations. Or perhaps it's a tensor. Wait, no, the derivative is a vector. So ∂μ φ is a vector, but in the Lagrangian, you have terms like (∂μ φ)^2, which are scalars. But as individual operators, they aren't scalars under Poincare. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about which symmetries the theory as a whole must have, not each operator. But the question says "all operators in SMEFT must respect." So each operator must transform in a way that the whole theory obeys these symmetries.

Wait, but CPT is a symmetry of the theory as a whole, not necessarily individual operators. Because CPT relates the operator to its CPT conjugate. So perhaps the operators themselves don't need to be CPT-invariant, but the full theory must be.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

Lorentz symmetry: Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. Because if the operator isn't a Lorentz scalar, then the theory would not be Lorentz-invariant. So yes, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Poincare symmetry: This includes translations. For the Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, each term must be a Lorentz scalar, and the Lagrangian must be the same everywhere (i.e., translation-invariant). So each operator is a scalar under Lorentz, but not necessarily under translations. Wait, but each operator in the Lagrangian is a function of the fields and their derivatives, which are all local. So the operator itself doesn't have to be translation-invariant, because the translation affects the position, but the operator is evaluated at a point. So perhaps each operator isn't required to be Poincare-invariant, but the entire Lagrangian is. So maybe the operators don't need to individually respect Poincare symmetry beyond being Lorentz scalars.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry is required by the effective theory as a whole, so each operator must be a Poincare scalar. But I'm getting a bit stuck on whether each operator must be a Poincare scalar or just the entire Lagrangian.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that Poincare symmetry is more about the theory as a whole, not individual operators. So the question is which symmetry must each operator respect.

I think that in the SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare scalars. Because each operator is a term in the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian must be a scalar density. Wait, the Lagrangian is a scalar density, so each term (operator) must be a scalar density. A scalar density is a tensor of rank zero but with a density weight, so it transforms under Lorentz transformations as a scalar, but under translations, the density doesn't change because it's integrated over the volume. Hmm, no, perhaps the Lagrangian is a scalar function, and each term in it must be a scalar function as well. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, but translations are handled by the fact that the Lagrangian is the same everywhere, so the operators themselves don't have to be invariant under translations.

So maybe the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations, and the operators are local, so they're evaluated at each point, but the theory as a whole is translation-invariant because the Lagrangian is the same everywhere.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if the operators weren't Poincare scalars, then the theory might not be Poincare-invariant. So perhaps the operators must be Poincare scalars.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look for another approach.

I remember that in the SMEFT, operators are classified by their Lorentz indices. For example, operators are built as Lorentz scalars. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Since the theory must be Poincare-invariant, the individual operators must transform as Poincare scalars. But wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if the operator is a scalar under Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a scalar under translations. But the Lagrangian must be a scalar under translations. Wait, but the Lagrangian is the same everywhere, so each term is a function of the fields and their derivatives, which are all local. So each operator is a function at a point, and thus, the Lagrangian is translation-invariant because adding the same operator everywhere gives the same contribution. So perhaps the individual operators don't need to be invariant under translations; it's the sum that is. So maybe each operator doesn't have to respect Poincare symmetry, but the entire theory does.

So, going back, the question is about which symmetries each operator must respect.

So, I think that each operator must transform as a Lorentz scalar, so Lorentz symmetry is a must. But Poincare symmetry is more about the entire theory, so perhaps each operator doesn't need to be a Poincare scalar. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about what happens if an operator doesn't respect Poincare symmetry. Would that break the Poincare symmetry of the theory? Let's say an operator O(x) transforms under translations as O(x) → O(x + a). If O(x) isn't invariant, then the term O(x) in the Lagrangian would not be the same under translation, but since the Lagrangian is integrated, maybe it's okay. Wait, but the action is the integral of the Lagrangian, so the integral would still be the same under translations if each term is a local function. So perhaps each operator doesn't need to be invariant under translations, only the sum (Lagrangian) needs to be invariant. So operators don't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry.

Therefore, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but Poincare symmetry isn't a requirement on each operator; it's a requirement on the whole theory. So the answer wouldn't include Poincare.

Wait, but then the first part of the question is whether all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which they do. So 1 is correct.

CP symmetry: As I thought earlier, not all operators must respect CP symmetry because the Standard Model itself doesn't. So 3 is out.

CPT symmetry: Since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. But this is a global symmetry of the theory as a whole. So each operator doesn't need to be CPT-invariant, but the theory must be. So the question is whether each operator must respect CPT. I'm not entirely certain, but I think that the operators themselves don't have to be CPT-invariant, because CPT is a symmetry of the theory as a whole. So perhaps 4 is not a requirement for each operator.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, if an operator violates CPT, would that cause a problem? Because the Standard Model itself is CPT symmetric. So I think that all operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, but how? Let me think. Suppose an operator O violates CPT. Then under CPT, O → O'. If O' isn't present in the Lagrangian, then the theory would have a term that isn't CPT-invariant, breaking the symmetry. But in the SMEFT, when you write down all possible operators, you have to include all possible terms that are Lorentz scalars. But CPT symmetry isn't necessarily enforced unless the operator's CPT conjugate is also included.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so the CPT symmetry is generally assumed unless there's a reason to include CPT-violating operators. But in the question, it's asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies it's CPT-invariant. Therefore, all operators must be such that the theory remains CPT-invariant. So each operator must be CPT-invariant because otherwise, the theory would break CPT. So each operator must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think when you write down operators in SMEFT, they are automatically CPT-invariant because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So each operator must have a CPT conjugate that is also present. Therefore, each operator must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So, putting it all together, the symmetries that each operator must respect are Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). Poincare (2) is not required for each operator, only the theory as a whole. So looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, 1 and 4 are required. So that would be 1 and 4. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, none of the options have just 1 and 4. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, another angle: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: The theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translations. But each operator doesn't have to be a Poincare scalar, only a Lorentz scalar. So Poincare is not a requirement on each operator, so 2 is incorrect.

CP symmetry: Not necessarily, so 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry: The theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant, but individual operators don't have to be CPT-invariant. Because if an operator isn't CPT-invariant, its CPT conjugate must also be present to preserve the symmetry. Therefore, individual operators don't have to be CPT-invariant; the theory as a whole must be. So 4 is not a requirement for each operator. So the correct symmetries are only 1.

Wait, but then which options include 1? Options A, C, D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about CPT. Let me think again. The theory must be CPT-invariant, so any operator added must not violate this. So if you add an operator that isn't CPT-invariant, you must also add its CPT conjugate. Therefore, individual operators aren't required to be CPT-invariant, but the theory must be. So each operator doesn't have to respect CPT symmetry on its own. Therefore, 4 is not a required symmetry that each operator must respect.

That means the only symmetry that each operator must respect is Lorentz symmetry (1). But looking at the options, none have only 1. The options are A (1,2), C (1,2,4), etc. So something's wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about Poincare symmetry. Maybe each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Because the effective theory is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Wait, Poincare symmetry for an operator would mean that it is invariant under both Lorentz and translation transformations. But how can an operator be invariant under translations? Because the operator is a function at a point. So perhaps the operator doesn't have to be invariant under translations, only the Lagrangian as a whole needs to be. So the operator doesn't need to respect Poincare symmetry, only the theory as a whole. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1 correct), but not Poincare (2 incorrect).

So, the only symmetry that each operator must respect is Lorentz. But in the options, the only option that includes 1 and either only 1 is not present. But the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So none of the options have only 1. This suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which symmetries the operators must respect, not necessarily the entire theory. So, for the operators to make sense in the theory, they must form a Poincare-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry. Because Lorentz is a local symmetry, and CPT is a consequence of Lorentz.

But again, the options don't have 1 and 4. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4. Because Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT are required.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall: in the SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct. What about Poincare? Each operator is a scalar, so it's a Poincare scalar? I'm not sure. Maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied if the operator is a Lorentz scalar and the theory is translation-invariant. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: in the SMEFT, the operators are built as products of fields and derivatives that are Lorentz scalars. Since the theory is Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and a scalar under translations. Wait, but how can an operator be a scalar under translations? Because translation invariance is a global symmetry that shifts the coordinates. So the operator itself doesn't have to transform under translations; the Lagrangian must be the same everywhere. So perhaps each operator doesn't need to be a Poincare scalar, only a Lorentz scalar.

So, the only symmetry that each operator must respect is Lorentz. Therefore, the correct answer would be option A (1,2) if Poincare is required, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between Poincare and Lorentz. In reality, Poincare symmetry is required for any relativistic theory, so the operators must form a Poincare-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, 1 and 2 are both required.

So, the correct symmetries are Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), so the answer is option A.

But what about CPT? Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. So each operator must be CPT-invariant, which would make option C correct (1,2,4).

But earlier I thought that each operator doesn't have to be CPT-invariant, as the theory as a whole must be. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about how these symmetries apply to individual operators versus the entire theory.

Let me try to think about what each of the options would imply.

Option A: 1 and 2. So all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. But I'm not sure about Poincare.

Option C: 1,2,4. So Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

But from earlier, I thought that each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (1 correct), but whether they must be Poincare scalars is uncertain. Also, for CPT, since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant, but whether each operator must be CPT-invariant is unclear.

Wait, I think there's another approach. The SMEFT must be a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Thus, 1 is correct.

The Poincare symmetry isn't an additional constraint beyond Lorentz and translation invariance. Wait, but the Poincare group includes Lorentz and translations. The theory must be Poincare-invariant, but the individual operators don't need to be Poincare scalars. So 2 is not a condition on each operator, only the theory as a whole.

As for CPT, the theory must be CPT-invariant because it's Lorentz-invariant, so each operator must be such that the theory remains CPT-invariant. But that doesn't necessarily mean each operator is CPT-invariant. It could be that for each operator O, its CPT conjugate O' is also present in the Lagrangian, ensuring CPT invariance.

So perhaps 4 is not required for each operator. Therefore, only 1 is required. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, but the options are:

A)1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to think again.

In the SMEFT, the operators are organized as Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: The entire theory must be Poincare-invariant, which means the operators as a whole must form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. But each operator doesn't need to be a Poincare scalar because the theory's invariance is built from the sum of operators. So 2 is not required for each operator.

CP symmetry: Not required, so 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry: The theory must be CPT-invariant, but each operator doesn't have to be, as the presence of their CPT conjugates can ensure this. So 4 is not required for each operator.

Wait, but the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So only 1 (Lorentz) is required. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Alternatively, maybe all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C is correct.

Another way: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Therefore, all operators must be Lorentz scalars (1 correct), and the theory must be Poincare-invariant. But each operator is a function at a point, so they don't need to be Poincare scalars. So 2 is incorrect.

So the only correct symmetry is 1. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I was wrong about Poincare.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz invariant (1 correct). The theory must also be Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be a Poincare scalar (2 correct). And since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant, so each operator must be CPT-invariant (4 correct).

But I'm not certain. Another thought: Poincare includes translations, and each operator is a function at a point, so the operators don't need to be invariant under translations. So 2 is incorrect. So the correct answer would be 1 and 4. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider what the SMEFT requires. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Therefore, all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes translations. The theory is Poincare-invariant, but each operator is a local function, so they don't have to be Poincare scalars. So 2 is not required for each operator.

CPT symmetry: The theory must be CPT-invariant, but individual operators don't have to be CPT-invariant, as the presence of their conjugates ensures this. So 4 is not required for each operator.

Therefore, the only correct symmetry is 1. But the available options don't have that. So I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:1,2,4. Because the theory must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translations. Therefore, operators must form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian, meaning they must be Poincare scalars. So 2 is correct.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to find another way. Maybe the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes 1,2,4.

So, Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT are required.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CPT doesn't need to be respected by each operator, but the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant.

But perhaps the fact that the theory is CPT-invariant implies that each operator must have their CPT conjugate, so each operator doesn't need to be CPT-invariant. So 4 is not required.

I think I'm too confused. Let me try to make a decision based on what I know.

The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

The theory must be Poincare-invariant, but each operator doesn't have to be, so 2 is incorrect.

The theory must be CPT-invariant, but each operator doesn't have to be, so 4 is incorrect.

So the only correct symmetry is 1. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about Poincare. Maybe each operator must be a Poincare scalar, so 2 is correct. Then, the correct answer is option A (1 and 2). Or perhaps option C (1,2,4).

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if the operators are Lorentz scalars and the Lagrangian is the same everywhere. So no individual operator requirement beyond being a Lorentz scalar.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A (1 and 2) or only 1.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1,2,4.

I think I'm going to have to make a choice here.

Based on my reasoning, the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry, but I'm not certain about Poincare.

Wait, but according to the SMEFT framework, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, and the theory is CPT-invariant. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and the theory must be CPT-invariant, so each operator must have a CPT partner if necessary. Therefore, each operator must be CPT-invariant. Or not?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries. So option C.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: CPT symmetry is a result of Lorentz symmetry. So any Lorentz-invariant theory is automatically CPT-invariant. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must be CPT-invariant as well. So 4 is correct.

So, 1, 2, and 4 are correct. So option C is correct.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: Poincare symmetry is a subset of the full symmetry group. So the operators must be Poincare scalars. Therefore, 2 is correct.

Putting all together, the correct answer is C: 1,2,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant framework that organizes all possible interactions of the Standard Model and beyond into operators of increasing dimension. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, and all operators must be Lorentz scalars. If an operator were not a Lorentz scalar, the theory would not be Lorentz-invariant, violating a fundamental principle of relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry is a strict requirement for all operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. While the theory as a whole must be Poincaré-invariant, individual operators do not need to be Poincaré scalars. The Lagrangian, which is the sum of operators, must be translation-invariant, but this does not impose the requirement that each operator itself is translation-invariant. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is not a strict requirement for each operator.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model, as evidenced by CP-violating phenomena like the CKM matrix. Consequently, operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry. This symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory and is automatically satisfied by any Lorentz-invariant theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it is also CPT-invariant. While individual operators do not need to be CPT-invariant, the theory as a whole must remain CPT-invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry is a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

**Answer: C**
