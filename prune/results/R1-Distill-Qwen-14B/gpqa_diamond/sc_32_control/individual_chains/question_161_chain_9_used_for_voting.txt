Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and vacuum systems. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas particles so that the electron microscopy works better because there's less stuff for the electrons to scatter off of. But even after doing all that, some gas molecules are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, based on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So in a high vacuum, this would be longer because there are fewer molecules to bump into.

When he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect the calculation directly. Wait, but the mean free path is dependent on things like pressure and temperature. Oh, but if the pressure is the same, why would the mean free path change?

Wait a minute—the problem says that the mean free path is determined based on the vacuum state, but when the electron beam is on, some other effect must be happening. Maybe the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. Oh, right! The electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or perhaps heat them up. Or maybe the gas molecules are getting excited by the electrons, changing their behavior.

Another possibility: when the electron beam is active, it has a high current. This current can cause electrons to collide with the gas molecules more frequently. Wait, but the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. If the pressure is the same, λ should stay the same. Hmm, maybe the presence of the electron beam creates some sort of electric field, or maybe the gas is being heated, which would increase the average speed of the gas molecules. If they're moving faster, collisions could happen more often, which would decrease the mean free path. Oh, but temperature is the same, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, but maybe the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to get knocked out of the system. Like, if the gas molecules are being ionized, charged, or perhaps even accelerated or pumped out due to the beam's energy. If the effective number of gas molecules decreases, then the pressure would effectively decrease, which would increase the mean free path. Because pressure and mean free path are inversely related—lower pressure (rarer gas) means longer λ.

Wait, but the question says that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so thermal expansion or contraction isn't the issue. So why would the mean free path change?

Alternatively, think about electron scattering. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. Each time an electron hits a gas molecule, it's a scattering event. But perhaps the gas molecules are also moving, so the electron's path is more likely to collide. But wait, the mean free path is already calculated for the gas molecules' movement. Oh, but wait, the mean free path for the electrons would be different. Oh, but the question says that the mean free path for the gas molecules changes, not the electrons.

Wait, no. The question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are colliding with the electrons more. So maybe the gas molecules' mean free path is being influenced by their interaction with the electrons.

Let me think about the formula for the mean free path. It's λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. So if T is the same, and pressure P is the same, then λ should remain the same. But wait, the pressure in the formula is the gas pressure. So if the presence of the electron beam somehow reduces the effective pressure because some gas is being removed or ionized, then P would be lower, making λ higher.

But the question states that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So unless the pressure is actually changing, which the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1, but after turning on the beam, the pressure might have changed. But why would pressure change? If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be pumped out or if it's causing them to stick to the walls or something. But in a UHV system, I think the pumps usually maintain the pressure, but perhaps the beam's interaction could cause a slight change.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized, leading to them being captured by the microscope's parts, effectively removing them from the compartment. So over time, the pressure would decrease, but if Mike made the observation immediately after starting the beam, maybe the pressure hasn't had time to change significantly. Hmm, but the question says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path changes. So perhaps there's a dynamic effect.

Alternatively, maybe the mean free path of the gas molecules is being altered because the electrons are providing another way for the gas to lose energy. Wait, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, another angle: in a vacuum, the mean free path is for the gas molecules to collide with each other. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are also colliding with the electrons, which are moving at high speeds. So each gas molecule could have a shorter mean free path because they're colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, λ1 is the mean free path without the electrons. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules have more targets to hit—both each other and the electrons. That would lead to more frequent collisions, hence a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1, right?

Wait, but the mean free path is about the distance between collisions. So if the gas molecules are colliding more because of the electrons, their average path would be shorter. So λ2 < λ1. That would correspond to option C.

But why wouldn't the mean free path be the same as before? Because the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor into the collisions. So the mean free path is calculated based on gas-gas collisions, but now there are gas-electron collisions as well. So the effective λ would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat locally, increasing the temperature. But the question says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it. Or perhaps the beam's energy is transferred, but if the overall temperature is the same, perhaps the thermal effects are negligible.

So, putting it all together. Without the electron beam, the mean free path is λ1. With the beam on, the gas molecules are more likely to collide with the electrons, so their mean free path is shorter. Thus, λ2 is less than λ1. So the correct answer would be C.

The question involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating in an ultra-high vacuum state, where Mike observes a change in the mean free path of gas molecules upon initiating the electron beam. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 based on the vacuum state. However, when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remains constant.

The mean free path (λ) is calculated using factors such as pressure (P), temperature (T), and molecular diameter (d). In the vacuum state, λ1 is determined based on gas-gas collisions. When the electron beam is activated, additional interactions occur: the gas molecules collide not only with each other but also with the high-energy electrons in the beam. These additional collisions increase the frequency of collisions, effectively reducing the mean free path. Since the temperature remains constant, the reduction in λ is due to the increased collision frequency caused by the electron beam.

Thus, the mean free path λ2 is shorter than λ1, as the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering events that reduce the average distance between collisions.

Answer: C
