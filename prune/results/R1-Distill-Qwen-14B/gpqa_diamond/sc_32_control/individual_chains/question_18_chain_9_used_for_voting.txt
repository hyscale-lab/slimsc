Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have different masses compared to the Sun. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. The problem gives me some elemental abundance values using the EW method under LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Equivalent Width method.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, I think I should write that correctly. The formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals some value. So for the Sun, for Fe, it's 7.5, meaning log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, actually, the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So, what's the ratio [Si/Star1] compared to [Si/Star2]? Or is it ratio of Star_1 to Star_2's silicon abundance? The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So probably [Si/Star1] divided by [Si/Star2], but I need to see.

Let me think about how to approach this. The problem gives us [X/Y] notation, which is logarithmic. Remember that [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY). So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe), etc.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so [nSi]_1 / [nSi]_2. Or perhaps the ratio in their photospheres, so perhaps (nSi in Star_1) / (nSi in Star_2)?

Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen, but I'm not sure. Let me look again.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So perhaps nSi1 / nSi2. Alternatively, maybe it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2, but I need to see.

I think the first step is to find the [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

But I don't have [Si/H] values directly. I have [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. But for Star_2, I also have [Mg/H] = 0.

Let me think.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). But wait, [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). Since Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, that means log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5 (from the Sun's data). So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1, the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.

We also know the [Si/Fe] for Star_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3.

Since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun, let's write nSi1/nH1.

nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi1/nFe1) = nFe1 * 10^{0.3}.

But nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = (1e-4.5) Sun's H. Wait, Sun's H is nH_sun = 1e7.5 approximately? Wait, because the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nH) = something? Wait no, the given data is 12 + log(nX/nH) equals a number.

Wait, let's step back.

Sun's data:

For Fe: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = -4.5.

So nFe1/nH1 = 1e-4.5.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3 = nFe1 * 2.

But nFe1 = (1e-4.5) * nH1. So nSi1 = 2 * (1e-4.5) * nH1.

But wait, nH1 is the hydrogen density in Star_1. But how does that compare to the Sun's?

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] would be zero, so Star_1's [Fe/H] is also zero, implying that the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun. So H in Star_1 would be proportionally the same as the Sun. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable for the absolute number, but perhaps for this problem, we can proceed with ratios.

So for Star_1:

[nSi1] = 2 * [nFe1] = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is 1e8. Let's not get confused with absolute numbers; maybe we can work with ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps express [nSi1/nH1] in terms of [nFe1/nH1] and [Si/Fe].

Because [nSi1/nH1] = [nSi1/nFe1] * [nFe1/nH1] = 10^{0.3} * (1e-4.5) → 10^0.3 is approximately 2. So nSi1/nH1 ≈ 2e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2=10^0.3 ≈ 2.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun) = -5.

So nMg2/nH2 = 1e-5.

Now, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 → so nSi2 = nMg2 / (10^0.3) ≈ nMg2 / 2.

So nSi2 = (nMg2) /2.

But nMg2/nH2 =1e-5 → nMg2 =1e-5 * nH2.

So nSi2 = (1e-5 * nH2) / 2 = (1e-5 / 2) * nH2 → 5e-6 * nH2.

So now, we have nSi1/nH1 and nSi2/nH2.

Wait, but we want the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to that in Star_2. So (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) → but wait, no, (nSi1/nH1) is a ratio, (nSi2/nH2) is another. The ratio would be (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute [nSi1/nH1] and [nSi2/nH2], then take the ratio.

Compute [nSi1/nH1] = 2e-4.5 → 2 * 1e-4.5 = 2e-4.5.

Similarly, [nSi2/nH2] = 5e-6.

Wait, let me compute the exact values.

First, for Star_1:

[nSi1/nH1] = 10^{0.3} * (nFe1/nH1) → 10^0.3 is about 2, so 2 * 1e-4.5 = 2e-4.5.

Which is 2 * (1e-4.5) = 2e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[nSi2/nH2] = (nMg2/nH2) / (nMg2/nSi2) ) → because [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) =0.3 → nMg/nSi = 10^0.3 → nSi = nMg / 10^0.3.

So [nSi2/nH2] = (nMg2/nH2) * (nSi2/nMg2) ) → (nMg2/nH2) * 1/(nMg2/nSi2) ) = [nMg2/nH2] / (nMg2/nSi2) ) → (nMg2/nH2) * (nSi2/nMg2) ) = nSi2/nH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach.

We have Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 → nMg2 = nSi2 * 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 * nSi2.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun) = -5 → nMg2/nH2 = 1e-5.

So nMg2 = (1e-5) * nH2.

But from earlier, nMg2 = 2 * nSi2 → 2 nSi2 = 1e-5 * nH2 → nSi2 = (1e-5 * nH2 ) / 2 → nSi2 = 5e-6 * nH2.

So [nSi2/nH2] = 5e-6.

Wait, so for Star_1, [nSi1/nH1] is 2e-4.5, and for Star_2, it's 5e-6.

Wait, but 2e-4.5 is 2 * 1e-4.5. 1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5 approximately. So 2e-4.5 is about 6.32e-5.

Star_2's [nSi2/nH2] is 5e-6, which is 0.005e-3.

Wait, but I'm getting [nSi1/nH1] ≈ 6.32e-5 and [nSi2/nH2] is 5e-6. So the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) is (6.32e-5) / (5e-6) ) = (6.32e-5) / (5e-6) ) = (6.32 /5 ) * (1e-5 /1e-6) ) → approx 1.264 * 10 → 12.64.

But wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi1 / nSi2.

Wait, hold on. Because [nSi1/nH1] and [nSi2/nH2] are both relative to their own hydrogen. So to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, you can't just take the ratio of their [nSi/nH] because the hydrogen content might vary.

Wait, but if the stars have different H, how can we find the ratio of their silicon? Because, for example, if Star_1 has more H, but also more Si, the ratio could vary.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] in the stars, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe1/nFe_sun = nH1/nH_sun → so Star_1's Fe abundance is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi1 = 2 * nFe1.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So nSi1 = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But nFe_sun is known. Let's think in terms of the Sun's values.

Wait, Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5 (from earlier calculation). So nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun.

So for Star_1:

nFe1 = (1e-4.5 * nH_sun) / nH_sun) * nH1 → 1e-4.5 * nH1.

So nSi1 = 2 * 1e-4.5 * nH1.

Thus, [nSi1/nH1] = 2e-4.5.

Which is 2 * 10^-4.5 = 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 6.32e-5.

Now, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2)=0.3 → nMg2 = nSi2 *10^0.3 ≈ 2 * nSi2.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2)=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, no. [Mg/H] is the logarithm of (nMg/nH) divided by the solar value. So [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → which implies nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Which means Star_2's Mg to H ratio is the same as the Sun's.

But the Sun's nMg/nH is 1e-5.

So nMg2 = (1e-5) * nH2.

But from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg2 = 2 * nSi2.

So 2 * nSi2 = 1e-5 * nH2 → nSi2 = (1e-5 * nH2) /2 → nSi2 = 5e-6 * nH2.

Thus, [nSi2/nH2] = 5e-6.

Now, to find the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars: nSi1 / nSi2.

But nSi1 = 2e-4.5 * nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 * nH2.

So the ratio (nSi1 / nSi2) = (2e-4.5 * nH1) / (5e-6 * nH2) ) → (2e-4.5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2).

Wait, but we don't know nH1 and nH2. How can we proceed?

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, but that's not necessarily the case. Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H] =0, but perhaps other elements are different.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe is same as Sun. [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg same as Sun.

But what about H? Are the H densities the same? I don't think we can assume that. So perhaps we need to relate the H densities.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the only thing that matters is the relative abundances, and the H cancels out.

Wait, let me think again.

We have:

nSi1 = 2e-4.5 * nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 * nH2.

The ratio is (nSi1/nSi2) = (2e-4.5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, can we proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the H to H ratio is the same as the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem gives us [Fe/H] for Star_1 and [Mg/H] for Star_2, but not [H/Fe] or anything else. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the H in each star is same as the Sun's. But that might not be correct because stars can have varying H due to different evolutionary stages, but I don't think that's given here.

Alternatively, maybe we're meant to ignore the H and just consider the ratios based on the given data.

Wait, but that may not be valid.

Wait, perhaps the [Fe/H] =0 means that [Fe/H]=0 → log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → which implies nFe/nH = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → which for Star_1, the Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H.

But wait, that's only for Fe. For other elements, like Si, I have to use the given ratios.

Wait, but perhaps to find [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → so log(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^{0.3}.

But since [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe = nFe_sun * (nH /nH_sun).

Wait, maybe it's better to compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi = nFe * 10^{0.3}.

And [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe/nH = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

So nFe = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH.

So nSi = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH * 10^{0.3}.

Then, [Si/H] for Star_1 is log(nSi/nH) = log( (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} ) → which is log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) + 0.3 → [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so log(nFe/nH) =0 → [Si/H]_1 =0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)=0.3 → nMg = nSi *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg/nH = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So nMg = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH.

So, nMg = nSi *10^{0.3} → (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH =nSi *10^{0.3}.

So nSi = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH / 10^{0.3}.

Then, [Si/H] for Star_2 is log(nSi/nH) = log( (nMg_sun/(nH_sun *10^{0.3}) )) → log(nMg_sun /nH_sun) - log(10^{0.3}) → which is [Mg/H]_2 -0.3 → 0 -0.3 =-0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Now, the ratio [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2 would be 0.3 / (-0.3) → -1. But that's just the logarithm of the ratio of their [Si/H] abundances.

Wait, but [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH). So the actual ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) is 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) =0.3; [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2)=-0.3.

So log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi2/nH2) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6.

Thus, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) =10^{0.6} ≈3.98≈4.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4.

Looking at the options:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So the closest is option A, ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
1. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
2. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: This implies \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
3. Using \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{-4.5} \), we find \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 2 \times 10^{-4.5} \).

### Star_2:
1. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \).
2. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: This implies \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
3. Using \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \), we find \( n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = (10^{-5}) / 2 = 5 \times 10^{-6} \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-4.5}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{0.5} \approx 0.4 \times 3.16 \approx 1.264 \times 10 = 12.64.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9** when rounded to one decimal place.
