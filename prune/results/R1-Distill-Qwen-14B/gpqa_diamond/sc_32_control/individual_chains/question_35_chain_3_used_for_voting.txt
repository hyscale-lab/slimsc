Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the angular momentum operator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Oh wait, the setup says that Ay is given as c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down the matrix S first. So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), so Ay would be:

c * [ 0   -i ] = [ 0    -i c ]
      [ i    0 ]   [ i c     0 ]

So, Ay is a 2x2 matrix with elements (0, -i c) in the first row and (i c, 0) in the second.

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I) and set it to zero.

The matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[ -λ     -i c ]
[ i c    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let's compute that. (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is c² * (1) = c². So the determinant is λ² - c² = 0.

So λ² = c² → λ = ±c. Oh wait, so the eigenvalues are plus and minus c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Wait, wait—hold on. Because when I compute (Ay - λ I), the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - ( (-i c)(i c) ). So the first term is λ², and the second term is ( (-i c) * (i c) ) which is (-i)(i) c². (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So that's c². So the determinant is λ² - c² = 0 → λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, which when c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. Oh wait, because these are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real, right? So any options talking about imaginary parts being non-zero would be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option A's statement is wrong because it suggests non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is a real number. But let me compute h/(4π) numerically. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. 4π is about 12.566. So h/(4π) is roughly 5.29e-35. That's a very small number, nowhere near 1. So option B doesn't fit either.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. The square of the angular momentum, A², commutes with all components, so eigenfunctions of any component are also eigenfunctions of A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's automatically an eigenfunction of A². So option C's first part is correct. What about the second part? Az is the z-component. Since the operator Ay and Az don't commute (they're different components of angular momentum), they don't share eigenvectors in general. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in option C is correct. I'll have to remember this for later.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, not sure. Basis functions are the eigenvectors, right? Because the operator can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions for Ay. So option D sounds correct as well.

Wait, but let me think again. The operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors (if non-degenerate). The eigenvectors form a basis, yes. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay. So option D is correct.

Wait, so which options are correct statements during the calculation?

So the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So when I'm solving for the eigenvalues, what do I find?

Option C and D are about the eigenfunctions and their properties. If during the calculation, I have to consider whether these statements are correct.

Wait, but the question is about what I would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps the question is about which statement is correct when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Hmm. Let's go back to the options.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so same eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so yes, they are the basis functions. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the possible options are A, B, C, D. The question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the question says, "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So perhaps the correct statements are about the process of calculating, not the outcome. Or perhaps the statements are about properties that I would use during the calculation.

Wait, for example, in finding the eigenvalues, do I need to know whether the eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay? Or whether they are eigenfunctions of A²?

Hmm. Let me think. So the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors involves just the matrix Ay. But if I know that the eigenfunctions are the same for A², that might be useful in other contexts, but perhaps not during the calculation of Ay's eigenvalues. Similarly, whether the eigenfunctions are basis functions for Ay is about the structure of the space, but again, maybe not directly relevant to the calculation.

Wait, but the question is about which statements are correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions form the basis, which is a property of the operator.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the statements is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the eigenvalues again.

So, Ay is a 2x2 matrix:

[ 0   -i c ]
[ i c   0 ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving (Ay - λ I) = 0.

Which gives determinant as λ² - (i c)(-i c) = λ² - (i*(-i)) c².

i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - c² = 0 → λ = ±c.

So eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So the real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But they don't share eigenfunctions with Az, because the components don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis. So option D is correct.

So both C and D could be correct statements. But looking at the options, the possible correct options are either C or D or another.

Wait, perhaps I should check the matrix S. S looks familiar. Oh wait, S is (up to a factor) the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is exactly S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * Y.

The eigenvalues of S are ±1, so for Ay, they are ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ±h/(4π), which matches earlier calculation.

Eigenvalues are real numbers, so the options talking about imaginary parts are incorrect except if the eigenvalues are complex. But they are real. So options A and B are wrong because they're talking about non-zero imaginary parts.

So the correct options are C and D. Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's also correct because eigenvectors form a basis.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with four options. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, in the options, C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so yes. Therefore, option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is also correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is only considering one correct option. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which statements are definitely correct.

Let me think again about the options:

Option C: Eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, because [Ay, A²] = 0 (since A² is the square of the vector operator, which commutes with each component), so yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². And since Az is another component, which doesn't commute with Ay, the eigenfunctions won't be eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix form a basis for the vector space (if the operator is diagonalizable, which it is since it's a Pauli matrix). So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis for the matrix operator Ay. So option D is correct.

Hmm, so both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, each option is a separate statement. So the question is, which statement is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as possible statements, and I have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But wait, the eigenfunctions are vectors in the space. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors because they form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

But then, why is option C correct?

Because the eigenvectors of Ay are indeed the same as those of A², so they can also be eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but the options are designed so that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the process of calculation. So when you're calculating the eigenvalues, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C or D. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, etc. But our calculation shows the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±0.5 and real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is about 0.00005 something. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Correct as discussed.

Option D: Also correct as discussed.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, I need to choose which one is correct.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation?

So during the calculation, perhaps the fact that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D) is a correct statement. But so is the fact that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az (C).

So I'm a bit confused. Are both statements correct, but only one is an option?

Wait, looking back at the given options, let's see:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

If both are correct, but the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps the question is only testing one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is done in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a property of the eigenfunctions.

But the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps when calculating eigenvectors, you're working in the basis of those eigenvectors. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the calculation process is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors mathematically. So perhaps the statements relate to properties that are true regardless of the calculation.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But considering that the eigenvalues are real and the eigenfunctions are orthogonal, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, not which is generally true. So perhaps the correct statement is C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So that's a correct statement.

Option D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions. That's correct too.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C. Because during the calculation, I don't directly compute the basis functions, but I know that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A². So maybe that's a correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C and D. But the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is which statement below is correct. So I have to choose between them.

Wait, let me think about what the calculation involves. When I calculate the eigenvalues, I find that they are ±h/(4π). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay.

The operator A² is given by A·A, which for spin-½ particles is proportional to the identity matrix. Wait, for spin systems, A² is ( (ħ/2 )² ) times the identity matrix, because the square of the angular momentum operator for each component is (ħ/2)^2 for spin ½.

Wait, wait. Spin matrices. For a spin-½ particle, S² = ( (ħ/2)² ) * 3 I, no wait—no, wait, no. Wait, S is the spin operator. For a spin-½ particle, the total spin squared is S² = ( (ħ/2) )² ( ( (σ_x)^2 + (σ_y)^2 + (σ_z)^2 ) ) + ... Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices each satisfy σ_i² = I for i=x,y,z. So S is proportional to σ matrices. So if S = (ħ/2) σ, then S² = (ħ²/4) (σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² ) ? No, wait, S is a vector operator where each component is (ħ/2) σ_i. So S² = (S_x)^2 + (S_y)^2 + (S_z)^2 ) = ( (ħ/2)^2 )( σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2 ) = (ħ²/4)(I + I + I ) = (3 ħ²/4) I.

Wait, no, because each σ_i squared is I, so each component squared is (ħ²/4) I. So summing the three gives (3 ħ²/4) I.

So for any eigenstate of Ay, which is a component of S, the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of S². Because S² commutes with each S_i, so their eigenfunctions are shared.

Thus, the statement in option C is correct.

So, during the calculation, I would consider that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is correct.

As for option D, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Well, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, so the statement is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but if both C and D are correct, but that's not possible since the options are separate.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Because in reality, for spin-½ systems, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute. So option C is correct. Option D is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the options are presented as possible answers, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the given statements is correct. So I have to choose between the options.

Alternatively, perhaps only option D is correct. Let's think again: the eigenfunctions φ form the basis of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvectors which form a basis. So yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the operator Ay. So the basis functions are the eigenfunctions, so yes, D's statement is correct.

Hmm. Now I'm really stuck. Both C and D seem correct. But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the question's options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π)

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

I think both C and D are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the eigenvalues are real, so the real parts are the eigenvalues, and the imaginary parts are zero. So the options A and B are talking about non-zero imaginary parts, which isn't the case. So the correct statements must be C and D.

But given that, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me think again about the problem. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues, perhaps I don't need to consider the properties of A² or Az. But I do know that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But I'm not certain. Perhaps the correct answer is C because the statement is about the properties of the eigenfunctions, which is a correct fact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions.

Wait, looking at the possible answers, in the problem statement, the options are presented as statements that you have to consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but since the options are given as separate, only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the question is more about whether the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts, which they don't. So the correct statements are C and D.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the process:

1. Write down Ay matrix.
2. Find eigenvalues: ±h/(4π).
3. Find eigenvectors.

Once I have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the statements are correct.

So during the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I can see that the eigenvectors form a basis (so option D is correct). Also, I know that the eigenvectors are eigenfunctions of A² because A² is diagonal in the same basis (so option C is correct).

So both C and D are correct.

But the options only allow for one correct choice. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculations. Let me double-check.

Ay = c S, where S is given. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the same as the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of S are ±1, so eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real.

So options A and B are incorrect because they mention non-zero imaginary parts.

So the correct options are C and D.

But the question only allows one choice. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, the question says, "which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So perhaps the correct statements are C and D. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & -i \\ 
   i & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det \begin{bmatrix} 
   -\lambda & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\lambda 
   \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)(i \frac{h}{4\pi}) = \lambda^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
   \]
   Setting the determinant to zero gives \( \lambda^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \), so the eigenvalues are:
   \[
   \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   These eigenvalues are real, with no imaginary components.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), with no imaginary components.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not close to 1 or \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are not shared.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix form a basis for the vector space.

4. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct statements. However, the question asks for a single correct statement to be selected. Since option C highlights a key property of the eigenfunctions in the context of angular momentum operators, it is the most appropriate choice.

ANSWER: C
