Okay, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the volume doubles. Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. 

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³ because 20+20=40. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40? No, wait, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

I think I need to calculate two different pH values here.

First, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but wait no, we diluted to 40 cm³, right. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M, then diluted to 40 cm³. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

To neutralize that, NaOH needs to provide 0.001 mol, since it's a 1:1 reaction (acetic acid + NaOH → sodium acetate + water).

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL, how much has reacted?

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid reacts, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion. 

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.001 mol. After reaction, moles of CH3COOH left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed is 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial 40 mL plus the NaOH added. At 2.5 mL NaOH, total volume is 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ log(1/1.85e-5) → wait, no, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is approximately 4.733.

Wait, more accurately: 1.85 is 1.85, so log(1.85) is about 0.267. So 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, yeah.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I should use exact values.

Wait, let's compute [A^-] and [HA] more precisely.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol.
Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.
Volume: 0.0425 L.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.0176470588 M.
[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058823529 M.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.0058823529)/(0.0176470588) = 1/3 exactly. Because 0.00025 is 1/3 of 0.00075, and same for the concentrations as same volume. So 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized into acetate ions. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence is moles / total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since we neutralized all the acid).

Total volume is initial 40 mL plus equivalence volume of 10 mL, so 50 mL = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. The hydrolysis can be approximated using the formula for weak bases:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 ) = sqrt(1.081e-11 ) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Oh wait, the options are A) 4.26;8.52, B)3.17;6.73, C)4.73;7.00, D)4.57;6.92.

Hmm, none of the equivalence points match 9.02. But I must have made a mistake. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another way is to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The pH should be greater than 7. Let me recalculate.

At equivalence, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02.

But the options don't have anything near 9.02. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb should be 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= (0.5405) * (1e-9) )= 5.405e-10. Yes, that's correct.

So the pH should be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the concentration.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, another thought. The volume of the solution at equivalence point is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL. So 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without the approximation. Let me set up the equation without assuming x is negligible.

The Kb expression:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So even with the exact equation, the x is 1e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So pH is around 9.02. But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A)4.26;8.52
B)3.17;6.73  
C)4.73;7.00
D)4.57;6.92  

Wait, none of the options have pH near 9. So perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the 25% titration from the initial volume, but that's not likely. No, the 25% is of the equivalence point volume, which I correctly calculated as 10 mL. So 2.5 mL added.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the acetic acid is being diluted before titration, but perhaps I should consider the dilution correctly.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let's recheck.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So remaining acetic acid: 0.00075. Acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 mL + 2.5 mL =42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.333) → pKa is about 4.733. Log(0.333)= -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256 ≈4.26. So that part is correct.

But equivalence point is around 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the 25% of the acid being neutralized, but perhaps the volume isn't 25% but the amount is 25% of the equivalence.

Wait, no. 25% of the equivalence point would be 25% of the moles. So the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point solution's pH. Let me think again. Another approach: perhaps I should consider the initial dilution correctly.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting to 40 mL gives 0.025 M.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to acetate (0.001 mol). The solution is 50 mL (40 mL +10 mL NaOH). So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis of acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So the hydroxide concentration is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.

But none of the options have this. The options' highest pH is 8.52 (A), which is less than 9.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the equivalence point. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the solution at equivalence point is not just the acetate and water, but maybe the NaOH is in excess? No, because equivalence is when exactly all the acid is neutralized. So no excess.

Wait, another thought: Did I perhaps mix up the concentrations? Let me double-check the initial moles.

Original solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Yes.

Diluted to 40 mL: 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M. Correct.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So the moles needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 mL.

So total solution volume at equivalence: 40+10=50 mL. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it affects the volume. But I think I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate pH at equivalence point using the formula for a buffer, but no, it's a salt of weak acid and strong base, so it's a basic solution.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the pH at equivalence as 7, which would be the case if the solution was a strong acid and strong base. But no, because acetic acid is weak.

So, given that, the equivalence pH should be higher than 7. So in the options, only option A has an equivalence pH of 8.52, which is higher than 7. Wait, but my calculation says 9.02, which is higher than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb.

Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is about 4.73. Correct.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should include the exact calculation without the approximation. Let's solve for x in the Kb expression without approximating.

Equation: x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02, so x² ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

x≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

[OH-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me check.

Original volume: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluted to 40 mL → new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. Correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the pH after adding 25% of the initial volume, not 25% of the equivalence point. Oh! Wait, the question says "at 25% titration". Titration is usually measured by the fraction of the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence point is correct. But perhaps the question refers to 25% of the initial volume, which would be 5 mL. No, that's not likely because equivalence is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the diluted solution's concentration. Let me check again.

M1V1 = M2V2.

M1=0.05 M, V1=20 mL → 0.05 *20=1 mmol.

V2=40 mL → M2=1 mmol /40 mL = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was applied incorrectly. Let me check.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

So pKa is 4.73, [A-] = 0.005882 M, [HA]=0.017647 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = 1/3 → log(1/3) = -0.477. So pH =4.73 -0.477 =4.253, which rounds to 4.25 or 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But then equivalence pH is around 9.02, but option A's second value is 8.52. Hmmm. So what's the correct answer? There's a disconnect here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point pH calculation. Maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which is a strong electrolyte, and the acetate will hydrolyze. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact method without the assumption.

Wait, another way: Let me compute the exact OH- concentration.

The equation Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 –x ≈0.02. So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So I must have made a mistake, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not 50 mL, maybe I miscalculated the total volume.

Wait, initial solution is 40 mL. Adding 10 mL of NaOH → 50 mL. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using exact values without approximation, perhaps the x isn't as small as I thought. Let me do that.

Equation: x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Plug in Kb=5.405e-10:

x² + 5.405e-10 x - (0.02)(5.405e-10) =0.

The quadratic equation: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02)(5.405e-10)= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = approx 2.92e-19 + 4.324e-11 → which is dominated by the second term, ~4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11)≈6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2.

Wait, the positive root is taken. So numerator ≈6.576e-6. Divided by 2 → x≈3.288e-6 M.

[OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but why did this happen? Because when I didn't make the approximation, the x is larger than I initially thought. Hmm, because when I used the quadratic formula, I got a different result.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let's compute the exact x.

x² = Kb*(0.02 – x)

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 –x)

x² +5.405e-10 x – (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0

x² +5.405e-10 x –1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ]/(2*1)

The discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 is 2.920e-19. 4 *1*1.081e-11 is 4.324e-11. So sum is 4.324e-11 +2.92e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6 M.

[OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514, which is approximately 8.51.

So at equivalence, the pH is about 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Wait, so earlier I thought x was 1.04e-5, but when I applied the quadratic formula without approximation, I get x=3.288e-6. Which gives a higher pH, closer to 8.52.

Ah, so my mistake earlier was in assuming that x is so small that 0.02 –x ≈0.02. But in reality, x is about 3.288e-6, which is 0.0003288% of 0.02, which is negligible, but perhaps the calculation requires more precise handling.

Wait, but wait, 3.288e-6 is 0.003288 mM. 0.02 is 20 mM. So 0.003288 /20 → 0.01644% of 0.02, which is small. So the approximation should still hold, but why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic equation. Let me recompute the discriminant.

Wait, 5.405e-10 is 5.405 x 10^-10. So (5.405e-10)^2 is (5.405)^2 x 1e-20 → 29.20 x1e-20=2.92e-19.

4ac is 4 *1* (-1.081e-11) → no, wait, in the equation, c is -1.081e-11. So 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → no, wait the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x –1.081e-11 =0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11 + 2.92e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2.

This is approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6.

pOH= log(3.288e-6) → Let me compute that accurately.

Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6)=0.517 -6 = -5.483.

So pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517, which is approximately 8.52.

So that's where option A's 8.52 comes from.

Wait, but earlier when I used the small x approximation, I got [OH-]≈1.04e-5, which would give a pH of 9.02, but after correcting with the quadratic formula, I get pH≈8.52.

Wait, but why is there such a difference? Because when x isn't that negligible, the approximation fails. But in reality, 3.288e-6 is 0.03288% of 0.02. So maybe the approximation is still valid, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the Kb expression.

Wait, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

The acetate ion (0.02 M) is in solution, and when it reacts, it produces x moles of OH- and x moles of CH3COOH.

So the concentration of acetate becomes 0.02 –x, and CH3COOH is x.

So Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 –x) = x²/(0.02 –x).

Ah, that's correct.

So, without the approximation:

x² = Kb*(0.02 –x)

But then, when solving, the quadratic equation suggests x is about 3.288e-6, which is indeed small compared to 0.02, but the calculation leads to a lower pH than the initial approximation.

Wait, but wait, if x is 3.288e-6, then 0.02 –x is 0.0199967 M, which is approximately 0.02, so the approximation holds. So why did the quadratic method give a different x? Because the exact solution takes into account the small x, but in reality, the x is so small that the approximation is still valid. So why did the initial approximation give a larger x?

Wait, no, the initial approximation for [OH-] was sqrt(Kb * C) → sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But the exact solution gave x=3.288e-6.

Wait, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute Kb*C.

Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02.

Kb*C=5.405e-10 * 0.02=1.081e-11.

The square root of Kb*C is sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5, which would be [OH-] if the approximation holds.

But when I did the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6, which is lower than 1.04e-5. That can't be right because Kb*C is 1.081e-11, and the square root is 1.04e-5, but the quadratic solution suggests a lower x. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Let me re-do the quadratic equation correctly.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x – 1.081e-11 = 0.

The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=–1.081e-11.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.920e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11) =6.576e-6.

So,

x=[ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root, so:

x= (6.576e-6 –5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

Wait, but that can't be right because Kb*C is 1.081e-11, and if x is 3.288e-6, then x²=1.081e-11, which makes sense because x²=Kb*C.

Ah! Because x² = Kb * C → x = sqrt(Kb*C) → which is 1.04e-5. So why does the quadratic solution give x=3.288e-6? That's a discrepancy.

Wait, I think I must have made a miscalculation. Because x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M.

Wait, but according to the quadratic formula, x=3.288e-6, which would give x²=1.081e-11. Wait, 3.288e-6 squared is (3.288)^2 x 1e-12 = ~10.8 x1e-12 =1.08e-11. Yes! Oh, I see. So x is 3.288e-6, which when squared gives 1.08e-11, which is Kb * C.

So, the initial approximation was x= sqrt(Kb*C)=1.04e-5, but the quadratic solution gives x=3.288e-6, which also satisfies x²=Kb*C.

Wait, that's impossible. Because (3.288e-6)^2=1.08e-11, which is Kb*C. So why did the quadratic solution give a different x? Because I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, another thought: When I set up the equation, perhaps I should have included only the concentration, not the actual moles.

Wait, perhaps I should have written the equation differently. Let me think again.

The correct expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

At equilibrium:

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] =x

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 –x.

So,

Kb = x²/(0.02 –x).

But because Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 –x ≈0.02.

Thus,

x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 →x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic, x=3.288e-6, which is 1/3 of this. Which can't be right because (3.288e-6)^2= 1.08e-11, which is exactly Kb*C. So I'm getting conflicting results. I think I must have made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me re-calculate.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x – (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

So x² +5.405e-10 x – 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ]/(2*1) 

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 =2.920e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

Adding them: 2.920e-19 +4.324e-11 =4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is much smaller).

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2.

So,

x ≈ (6.576e-6) /2 → ~3.288e-6.

But wait, (3.288e-6)^2 = 1.081e-11 → which is Kb*C, which is 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. So x=3.288e-6.

So why is the approximation giving x=1.04e-5?

Because sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x=3.288e-6. Which can't be correct because (3.288e-6)^2 is 1.08e-11, which is exactly Kb*C.

Ah, now I see. The mistake is that in the quadratic solution, x is the concentration of OH-, which is the same as the concentration of CH3COOH. But according to the equation, x^2 = Kb * (0.02 –x).

If x is 3.288e-6, then 0.02 –x ≈0.02. So x^2 = Kb *0.02 → x= sqrt(Kb*0.02)=1.04e-5 M. But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6, which is a third of that.

This is a contradiction. So perhaps I should double-check the equation.

Wait, perhaps I set up the equation incorrectly. Another possibility: Maybe the correct equation is x = [CH3COOH] = [OH^-], but the acetate is 0.02 –x.

Wait, no, the correct expressions are:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So,

[CH3COOH] =x,

[OH^-] =x,

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 –x.

So,

Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 –x) → x²=Kb*(0.02 –x).

But according to our calculations, when x=1.04e-5, x²=1.08e-10, which is Kb*0.02 =1.08e-11. That doesn't match.

Wait, 1.04e-5 squared is 1.08e-10, but Kb is 5.405e-10, so 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. So 1.08e-10 is not equal to 1.08e-11.

So, x=1.04e-5 would give x²=1.08e-10, which is higher than Kb*C=1.08e-11.

So, the initial approximation overestimates x.

But the quadratic solution gives x=3.288e-6, which gives x²=1.08e-11, which matches exactly Kb*C.

So the correct x is 3.288e-6, which gives [OH-]=3.288e-6.

pH=14 – pOH → pOH= log(3.288e-6)=5.483 → pH=8.517.

So, the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52, matching option A's second value.

So, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence point it's 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it is diluted to 40.00 cm³ by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the diluted concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \cdot V_{\text{total}} = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The titration involves 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid. Thus, the volume of NaOH required at the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH, eq}} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 mL of NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
and
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at this point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.5 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion in a total volume of 50 mL (40 mL + 10 mL NaOH). The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the formula for weak base hydrolysis:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{5.41 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing these values with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
