Okay, so I’ve got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the information given step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let me list them out to understand the compounds involved.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. I'm thinking maybe A is a metal because it's a solid, and B is probably a halogen gas since they can form compounds with metals. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2), then C would be NaCl. Wait, but sodium chloride is a white solid. The product C is bright red, so maybe it's not NaCl. Alternatively, could it be something like Cu reacting with Cl2? But copper would form CuCl2, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with something else, but sulfur is a solid but not a metal. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the bright red product might be a transition metal compound. For example, maybe it's a compound of iron or copper. Alternatively, perhaps the red color suggests something like a nitrate or sulfate. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or F2. Let me think: if A is aluminum and B is something else, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should move on and see what other clues I have.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene or another highly toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone? Wait, ozone is a gas, though. Alternatively, maybe E is a strong acid or a highly reactive oxide. Hmm, not sure yet.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (maybe a salt) reacts with water, it undergoes hydrolysis. If C is a salt of a strong acid and weak base, or vice versa, it would produce different acids. For example, if C is NaCl (but earlier I thought C was red, which NaCl isn't), but perhaps it's a different salt.

Wait, let's think again. If the first reaction is A (solid) + 8B (gas) → C (bright red). Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas to form a red solid. Maybe the reaction is between a metal and chlorine gas. For example, if A is copper (Cu), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. But what color is CuCl2? It's usually blue, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal. Wait, what about iron? Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's not a chloride.

Wait, another angle: the product C, when reacted with water, produces two different acids. So, C is likely a salt of some sort. If C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two acids, maybe it's like a metal that forms two different oxyacids. For example, suppose C is a nitride or a sulfide. Let's think: if C is Cu3P, but I don't know. Wait, perhaps C is a compound that when it reacts with water, forms two acids. For example, if C is NaHCO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first reaction. 8 equivalents of gas B reacting with solid A. 8 is a high number. Let me think about metals and their valency. For example, if B is Cl2, and A is sodium, which has a +1 charge, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 Cl2 molecules reacting with 1 mole of Na? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if A is aluminum, which has a +3 charge, and B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 would react with 2 moles of Al to produce 2 AlCl3. Because each Al gives 3 electrons, each Cl2 molecule accepts 2 electrons. So, 2 Al (6 electrons) would react with 3 Cl2 (6 atoms) to make 2 AlCl3. Oh wait, but that would be 3 Cl2, not 8. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a metal and a diatomic gas. Let me think of another possibility. What if A is a metal oxide, but that doesn't fit because the product is a solid that reacts with gas B. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. But O2 is a gas, but in that case, the reaction would be a metal reacting with O2 to form a metal oxide. But then, the oxide (C) reacting with D would form E. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product C when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid F and a weak acid G. So, if C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids, perhaps it's a salt from a weak base and a weak acid, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3, but that's not a bright red solid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the third reaction again.

C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a salt, say, MgNH4PO4 (magnesium ammonium phosphate), but that's not red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but again not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal carbonate. Let me think: when a carbonate reacts with water, it usually just produces the corresponding acid. But if it's a carbonate of a metal that forms two different acids upon hydrolysis, maybe it's a bicarbonate? No, bicarbonate would give just one acid, I think.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is something else. Let me think: when a metal reacts with chlorine, it forms a chloride. If the metal is sodium, which has a +1 charge, and Cl2 is the gas, then 1 Na reacts with 0.5 Cl2 to form NaCl. But the stoichiometry here is 2 moles of NaCl for each mole of Cl2. But in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of gas B are used. So, 8 moles of B would react with 8/2 =4 moles of A? Because for each mole of B (like Cl2), you get 2 moles of product (like 2Cl- per B molecule). Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, maybe B is another diatomic gas. Let's say B is O2. Then, A could be a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide. For example, copper reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is iron, and B is O2, but FeO is black as well. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is F2, but that's a gas. Let me think: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of F2. For example, if A is magnesium, Mg reacts with F2 to form MgF2. But MgF2 is white. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium, Na, which reacts with F2 to form NaF. But again, not red.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the first reaction. Let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. E is extremely hazardous. What reactions produce such products? Maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but for that, C might be a cyanide salt. Alternatively, perhaps D is a halogen, but not sure.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H (solvent). Common solvents are water, ethanol, etc. So, perhaps D and B are something that when combined produce H, which is a solvent. For example, if B is H2O (but B is a gas, so it's not water), or maybe B is Cl2, D is something else.

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio. Let me think of H being something like HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, H could be something like ethanol. Wait, but how would B and D combine to form ethanol? Maybe B is H2O and D is something else, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if B is Cl2 and D is H2O in a 1:1 ratio, then perhaps they form HCl and HOCl? But that would be in a 1:1 molar ratio? Or maybe H and Cl combining in some way. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O? No, because that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but how would B and D combine to make that?

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then O2 + H2 could form H2O, which is a solvent. So, H would be H2O. But in that case, O2 and H2 would react in a 1:1 ratio (since 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O). Wait, but the stoichiometry isn't 1:1. It's 2 H2 to 1 O2. So in that case, D would be H2, B is O2, and H is H2O. So D and B would react in 2:1 ratio. But the problem says 1:1, so that might not fit.

Hmm. Let me think differently. Perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another diatomic gas. For example, D could be H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2HCl, but that's in a 1:1 ratio in terms of moles. So, D is H2, B is Cl2, and H is HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3 or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) to form NH3, which is a solvent. But the reaction of N2 and H2 requires a catalyst and is in a 1:3 ratio. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O. Then, perhaps they form something like H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid and not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the first reaction again. The product C is bright red. What bright red compounds do I know? Maybe it's a nitro compound? Or perhaps a chromium compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur compound. For example, when concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with a metal, it can produce SO2 and other byproducts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the red product is CuO, but that's black. Or maybe it's iron(III) oxide which is reddish brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and sulfur. For example, if A is Fe and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O3, but ozone is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a transition metal with a +3 oxidation state, which gives it a red color. For example, Co(III) compounds can be red. So if A is Co metal reacting with B, which is O2 or another oxidizing gas, perhaps.

But I'm not making progress with this approach. Maybe I should move on to another point.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to form A (the original solid), and two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Let's think about what kind of salt would hydrolyze into a strong acid and a weak acid.

For example, if C is a salt of a weak base and a weak acid. Suppose C is NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce NH4OH (a weak acid, since NH4+ is a weak acid) and HNO3 (a strong acid). But NH4NO3 is a white crystalline solid, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a metal sulfite. For example, CaSO3. When it hydrolyzes, it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid, but unstable) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But that's not two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitrate and a sulfate. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: if C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce two different acids. Unless it's a bicarbonate. Wait, NaHCO3: when it reacts with water, it might produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate salt. For example, MgNH4PO4 (a magnesium ammonium phosphate). When it reacts with water, it might release H3PO4 (a weak acid) and NH4OH (a weak acid as well). But in the problem, F is strong acid and G is weak, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. If C is a metal nitride, like Mg3N2, then reacting with water would produce NH3 (a weak base, not an acid) and Mg(OH)2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, say, FeS. Reacting with water doesn't produce two acids. Unless it's a complex sulfide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is MnO2. Reacting with water doesn't do much. Unless it's in a special condition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible reactions and the products.

In the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B reacting with A. Let me think of a known reaction where a solid reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas. For example, the reaction of sodium (Na) with chlorine gas (Cl2) to form NaCl. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So, 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of Na. So, in terms of equivalents, each mole of Cl2 has 2 equivalents. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 4 moles. So, the reaction would require 8 equivalents of Na (since each Na is 1 equivalent). Wait, but the problem says 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps B is Cl2. Let me see: for each mole of Cl2 (which is 2 equivalents), 2 moles of Na are consumed (each Na is 1 equivalent). So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would require 8 moles of Cl2 * (2 moles Na / 2 moles Cl2) = 8 moles Na? That doesn't fit because the stoichiometry is 2 Na : 1 Cl2. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 4 moles (since 1 mole Cl2 is 2 equivalents). Then, 4 moles Cl2 would react with 8 moles Na to produce 8 moles NaCl. So that fits 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) reacting with A (Na). Then, product C would be NaCl.

But wait, NaCl is a white solid, not red. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So, 3 moles Cl2 (6 equivalents) reacting with 2 moles Al. So, if the problem states 8 equivalents of B, which is Cl2, that would require (8/2) = 4 moles Cl2. So, 4 moles Cl2 would react with (8/3) moles Al. The product would be (8/3) moles AlCl3. But AlCl3 is a white solid, not red. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. What if the product C is something like CuCl2? But as I thought earlier, it's blue. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) chloride is green, I think. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't between a metal and a halogen. Maybe it's a non-metal. For example, sulfur reacting with another element. But sulfur is a solid, not a gas, so B wouldn't be sulfur.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product E. It's formed when C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe sarin gas, but I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. How would that form?

Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas, but that's the same as B. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, let's think of possible reactions where two gases combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, combining to form H2O. But O2 and H2 react in a 1:2 ratio. So that's not 1:1. Alternatively, if B is CO2 and D is H2O, but that doesn't combine directly.

Wait, another possibility: B is NH3 and D is HCl, but both are gases. They can react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is HCl and D is NaOH (but NaOH is a solid, not a gas). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is NO2 and D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O to form H2SO4. But SO3 is a liquid under standard conditions, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe D is O2 and B is F2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form something. But I don't know what that would be. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is another gas, but I'm not making progress.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry group question. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

The symmetry groups are related to the shape of the molecule. For example, D4h is a high symmetry group, often found in molecules with a square planar structure or octahedral with certain symmetries. D∞h is for linear molecules like CO2 or H2O (though H2O doesn't have D∞h). C2 is a twofold rotation axis. C2v is a two-fold rotation plus a vertical mirror plane.

So, what would E's structure be? Since E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's a molecule with a certain symmetry. For example, phosgene (O=CCl2) has a trigonal planar structure, which would have D3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E could be something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I'm not sure about its structure. Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule like COCl2, which is phosgene. Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, the molecule has a trigonal planar structure, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not an option here.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule with a C2v symmetry. For example, molecules with a central atom and two different substituents on one axis and another substituent on the other. Wait, like H2O has a V shape, which is C2v symmetry. But H2O isn't E because E is a product of C and D, which might not be water.

Wait, so if E has a C2v symmetry, what kind of molecule would that be? Maybe something like SO2, which has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. But SO2 is a gas, and it's toxic but not extremely hazardous in the same way as some other chemicals.

Wait, another angle: If E is a molecule with a linear structure, like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. CO2 is a linear molecule, so its symmetry group is D∞h. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h symmetry as well. But if E is O2, that's unlikely because O2 is a diatomic molecule and not extremely hazardous in the same way as some other compounds.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. HCN is highly toxic, but not sure if it's considered extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is something like ClF3, but that's a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry.

Wait, but the options given don't include D3h or C3v. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck on determining E's structure without knowing what E is. So perhaps I should try to find what E is based on the reactions.

Let me try to piece it together again.

First reaction: A (solid) +8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Second reaction: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous). Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Fourth: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

So, perhaps let's think about what H is. Since H is a solvent, it's likely a liquid. So, when D and B (gases) react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O, but H2O is a liquid. Or maybe B is another gas that when reacted with D forms a solvent. Let me think of possible D and B reactions.

If B is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas), but let's say hypothetically that B is H2O (gas), then D could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl, combining to form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. They combine to form H2O, which is a solvent. So, let's say B is O2, D is H2. Then, H is H2O.

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But in that case, the stoichiometry is 2:1 for H2 and O2. The problem states that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is F2. They react in a 1:1 ratio, but I'm not sure of the product. Could be O2F2? O2F2 is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure if it's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But they don't react directly. Unless under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what D could be. If D is a diatomic gas, perhaps Cl2 or another halogen. Let me think: if D is Cl2, and B is another gas, but then their reaction would produce something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps D is a gas like HCl. If B is another gas like O2, then HCl and O2 don't react in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps B is O3 (ozone), but not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the hydrolysis reaction again. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces two different acids. For example, if C is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), but upon hydrolysis, it would produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Doesn't fit.

Wait, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, it reacts with water to produce NH3 (weak base) and Mg(OH)2. Not acids.

Another idea: maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid, unstable) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like CH3SO3Na. When it hydrolyzes, it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and CH3OH (weak acid). But F is a strong acid and G is weak. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, if C is Ca(H2PO4)2. When it reacts with water, it might produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (strong base). Again, not two acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is a mixed anion salt. For example, if C is something like NH4HSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NH4+ (weak acid), HSO4^- (which can act as an acid), and SO4^2- (weak acid). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the problem says two different acids: F is strong, G is weak. So, perhaps when C hydrolyzes, one of the products is a strong acid and the other is a weak acid. The only strong acid I can think of in hydrolysis products is H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. So, if one of the acids is HCl, then F would be HCl, a strong acid, and G would be something like H2CO3 or H3PO4, a weak acid.

So, perhaps C is a chloride and a carbonate. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate or something else.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it's stable, but perhaps under certain conditions it can decompose. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like Ca(ClO)Cl. When it reacts with water, it might produce HCl (strong acid) and HClO (weak acid). Yes, that fits. So, if C is Ca(ClO)Cl, then:

Ca(ClO)Cl + H2O → Ca(OH)Cl + HCl + HClO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NaClO. Reacting with water, it could produce HClO and NaOH. But NaOH is a strong base, not acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a chlorite salt, such as Ca(ClO2)2. When it reacts with water, it might produce HClO2 (a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But again, that's a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite salt. For example, Na2SO3. Reacting with water, it produces H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think back to the first reaction. If A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps B is Cl2, and A is a Group 1 metal like Na. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So, 1 mole of B (Cl2) reacts with 2 moles of A (Na), which is 2 equivalents of A. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps 8 moles of B (Cl2) reacting with 16 moles of Na, producing 16 moles of NaCl.

But NaCl is a white solid. So, not matching the bright red color.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. Manganese(IV) oxide is black, but some manganese compounds are red. For example, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is purple, but that's in solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product C is a transition metal with a +2 oxidation state, which can sometimes appear red. For example, cobalt(II) compounds can be pink. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a reaction where a metal reacts with Cl2 in a 8:1 ratio. Let's see, the reaction of aluminum and Cl2 is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So, 3 moles of Cl2 react with 2 moles of Al. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 4 moles. So, 4 moles Cl2 would react with (4 *2)/3 ≈ 2.666 moles Al. So, the product would be about 2.666 moles AlCl3. AlCl3 is a white solid. Doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options again. Maybe I should try to figure out what E could be. Since E is formed when C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio, and it's extremely hazardous.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. To form HCN, C might be a cyanide salt. So, if C is NaCN, then reacting with D (maybe HCl gas) could produce HCN and NaCl. But would that fit the reactions?

Wait, the first reaction would produce C as NaCN. But how? Let me see: If A is Na (solid), and B is C (carbon, but that's a solid, not a gas). So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas, like OCN- or something. Not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2. Phosgene is a toxic gas. To produce phosgene, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound. Let me think: C could be COCl2, but then what would the reaction be?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloroformate or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: If C is a salt that upon reaction with D produces a highly toxic gas. For example, if C is sodium sulfide (Na2S) and D is HCl, then reacting them would produce H2S gas, which is toxic but not extremely hazardous in the same way as, say, sarin or phosgene.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the overall picture.

So, from the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

From reaction 3: C hydrolyzes to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C must be a salt that when hydrolyzed gives A, and the two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt of a weak base and a strong acid. For example, if C is NH4NO3, which would hydrolyze to give HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak acid). But as I thought earlier, NH4NO3 is white.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a nitrate salt, like NaNO3. Reacting with water, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate salt. For example, CuSO4.5H2O is blue, not red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate salt. MgNH4PO4 is white, but maybe another phosphate is red. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na. Reacting with water would produce HSO3- (which is a weak acid) and CH3OH (which is a weak acid). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, that doesn't make sense because metal oxides typically form bases when reacted with water.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. For example, if C is a mixed oxide of a metal and a non-metal. Let me think: PbO2 is a dark brown solid. Not red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2 is a liquid, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm. I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry groups again.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has a D∞h symmetry, it would be a linear molecule. Examples include O2, CO2, HCN. These are all linear. If E is a linear molecule, it could be something like phosgene (O=C=O is linear, but phosgene is O=CCl2, which is also linear).

Wait, phosgene is O=CCl2, which has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, the molecule is trigonal planar, but that's not one of the options. Wait, trigonal planar would have D3h symmetry. But that's not among the choices.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule with C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has a V shape, which is C2v. But H2O is a solvent, which is H in reaction 4. So, in reaction 4, D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O, then perhaps D and B are gases that react to form H2O.

Wait, if H is H2O, then reaction 4 is D + B → H2O. So, D and B are gases that combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. What gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O? Perhaps H2 and O2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else, but that doesn't make sense since H2O is a liquid.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas), which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but as before, their ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

Wait, another possibility: if B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But they don't react directly. Maybe under high pressure, but I don't think so.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to think of E's structure based on the options.

If the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v, then perhaps E has a structure that fits one of these.

D∞h symmetry implies a linear molecule. So, if E is a linear molecule, it could be something like Cl2O (which is dichlorine monoxide), but I'm not sure about its structure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. That would fit option D.

Wait, SO2 has a bent structure, which is V-shaped, with bond angles around 120 degrees. Its point group is D3h, but that's not one of the options here. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another idea: Maybe E is a molecule with a C2v symmetry, like H2O (but that's H in this case). Alternatively, perhaps E is something like SO2, which despite being bent, has a C2v symmetry. Wait, no, SO2 has a D3h symmetry because of the three-fold axis and mirror planes.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like OCS (thioyl chloride), which has a structure similar to O=CCl2, so it's linear, which would have D∞h symmetry. So, OCS is a linear molecule, with O double-bonded to C, which is single-bonded to S. So, the structure is O=C=S, which is linear. That would have D∞h symmetry.

If E is OCS, which is a toxic gas, that could fit as extremely hazardous. Then, the molecular symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions leading to E. If C reacts with D to form E, and D reacts with B to form H (a solvent), which could be H2O.

Wait, if H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. So, D and B are gases that combine in 1:1 to form H2O. For example, D is H2 and B is O2, but their ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2O. But B is a gas, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O3 (ozone) and D is H2O. Not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If E is OCS, then D might be something like S (but S is a solid) or another gas. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. Then, D would be Cl2 and C would be O=C=O (which is CO2). But I'm not sure how that fits into the reactions.

Wait, another angle: If D is Cl2 and B is CO, then perhaps their reaction produces something. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on this. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the options and the most probable answer. Based on the options and the fact that E is a linear molecule (if it's phosgene or OCS), which would have D∞h symmetry. So, the answer would be option C) D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests A and B are likely a metal and a diatomic gas, respectively. However, the bright red color of C is unusual for typical metal halides, making it challenging to identify A and B definitively.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is a highly toxic compound. Examples of such compounds include phosgene (O=CCl₂) or sarin gas, but the exact identity remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids. However, the specific identity of C remains uncertain due to the lack of definitive evidence.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent, such as H₂O. However, the exact nature of D and B is not fully resolved.

### Molecular Symmetry Group of E
The question focuses on the molecular symmetry group of E. The options provided are:
- **C₂**: A twofold rotation axis.
- **D₄h**: A high-symmetry group with a combination of rotations, reflections, and inversions.
- **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules.
- **C₂v**: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes.

Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, it is likely a toxic gas. A plausible candidate for E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), which is a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry. Another possibility is a molecule like OCS (thioyl chloride), which also has **D∞h** symmetry. These linear structures align with the **D∞h** symmetry group.

Thus, based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
