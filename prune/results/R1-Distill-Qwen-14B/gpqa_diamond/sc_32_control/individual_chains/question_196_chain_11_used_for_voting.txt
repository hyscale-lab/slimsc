Okay, I'm trying to solve this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a spring with constant k and amplitude A, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². Then the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) should be equal to that, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem. Oh right, in relativity, things are different because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant.

So in relativity, the energy isn't conserved in the same way. The total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the oscillating energy. The potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic part is modified by gamma factors.

Wait, the relativistic energy for a particle is E = gamma * m c². But in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but maybe here we're considering the classical case. So the total energy E at any point is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? No, wait, because when the oscillator is at rest at the maximum displacement, its velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would just be the potential energy, (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because, in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc². Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, perhaps the energy equation is different. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, its velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So the kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is just the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Wait, no, the potential energy is part of the total mechanical energy. Or does the potential energy get incorporated into the rest mass somehow?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by considering energy conservation. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the speed is maximum. So the total energy at that point is all kinetic. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (gamma -1) mc². So at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². And the total energy at maximum displacement is the potential energy plus the rest energy. So the total energy at x=A is (1/2)kA² + mc². But wait, that doesn't make sense because mc² is the rest energy, which is always present. Hmm, perhaps I should think that the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the mechanical energy. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy of the oscillator is (1/2)kx², and at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Wait, that might not be correct. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy. But in relativity, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and the mechanical energy? Or is it the mechanical energy that includes the rest energy?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to write down the equations.

In the non-relativistic case:

E_total = (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max²

So v_max = sqrt( (kA²)/m )

Which is option C. But that's non-relativistic. Now, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So at maximum speed, the kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the total energy.

Wait, the total energy at the maximum displacement is (1/2)kA² (the potential energy) plus mc² (rest energy). At the equilibrium point, all of this is converted into kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc².

So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma -1) mc² + mc²

Wait, that would give (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc² - mc² + mc² => (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that can't be right because adding mc² on both sides. Let me try again.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's not moving, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². When it's at equilibrium, it's moving at maximum speed, so all of that energy goes into kinetic energy.

So,

E = (gamma) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² )

Because (1/2)kA² = (kA²/(2 m c² )) * m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me call the term (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as something, say, let's denote it as a.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + a

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + a)^2

Take reciprocal,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2

Which is,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

Simplify,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 )

Denominator is (1 + a)^2, numerator is (1 + 2a + a²) - 1 = 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ]

Factor numerator,

a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 )

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, let's plug a back in.

v² = c² [ (2a + a² ) / (1 + a )^2 ]

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

Denominator: (1 + a )^2

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, let's substitute:

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c² )) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) )^2

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can factor it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the expression for v in terms of gamma.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to rearrange the equation for gamma.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, gamma = [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(gamma) = (2 m c² ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c² )^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ (2 m c² )^2 / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

= [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c² )^2 ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(2 m c² )^2 + 2 (2 m c² )(k A² ) + (k A² )^2 - (2 m c² )^2

= 2 (2 m c² )(k A² ) + (k A² )^2

So,

v²/c² = [ 4 m c² k A² + (k A² )^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2

Factor numerator:

k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

But denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = [ (2 m c² ) + (k A² ) ]^2 = (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor numerator as [ (2 m c² + k A² ) * 2 m c² ]?

Wait, let's see:

The numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Wait, can we factor 4 m c² + k A² as 2*(2 m c²) + k A²? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the denominator as (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = (k A² + 2 m c² )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c² )^2

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption. Maybe in the relativistic case, the maximum speed isn't when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic. Because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So perhaps the approach is to find v_max when the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². But the total energy must be conserved.

Wait, another approach: the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated than the non-relativistic case. Maybe the potential is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, total energy E is (gamma m c² ) = (1/2) m c² + (1/2)k A². Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy plus the mechanical energy, which in non-relativistic case is (1/2)kA². So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At maximum speed, all of that mechanical energy is converted into kinetic energy. So,

E_kinetic = E_total - mc² = (1/2)kA²

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So,

(gamma -1 ) mc² = (1/2)kA²

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before. So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a for simplicity.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + a

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + a )

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a )^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2

Which can be written as,

v²/c² = [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2

Expand numerator,

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a²

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a² ) / (1 + a )²

Factor numerator,

a (2 + a ) / (1 + a )²

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )²

Now, substitute a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]²

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute the numerator:

k A²/(2 m c² ) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

= [k A²/(2 m c² ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ]

The denominator of v² is:

[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]^2

So,

v² = c² [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Wait, the denominators are same, so when dividing, they cancel.

So,

v² = c² [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2

Wait, let me factor 4 m c² + k A² as 2*(2 m c² ) + k A². Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out 2 m c².

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c² ) + k A².

Hmm, not sure. Let me look at the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that would be c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - x )^2 ), where x is (k A²)/(2 m )

Hmm, but in our case, a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Wait, from earlier,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]

Which is,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 = [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2

Which is [2a + a² ]/(1 + a )^2.

Which is the same as I had before.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [2a + a^2 ] / (1 + a )^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( [ a(2 + a) ] / (1+a)^2 )

Hmm. Let me compute this:

sqrt( a (2 + a) / (1+a)^2 ) ) = sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Let me factor numerator inside the square root:

a(2 + a ) = a (2 + a )

And denominator is (1 + a )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly resembles this.

Wait, let me compute the expression under the square root:

a (2 + a ) = 2a + a².

So,

sqrt( (2a + a^2 ) / (1 + a )^2 )

= sqrt( [ a(2 + a ) ] ) / (1 + a )

Wait, perhaps I can write 2a + a^2 = a(a +2 )

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator (1 + a )^2 as (a + 1 )^2.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, that's different.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let's see what 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ] is.

From earlier,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] 

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly what option D is saying.

Because option D is sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Wait, let me check.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So the expression for v is c times sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ]), where a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but let me be precise. 

Our v is c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] )

Which is exactly option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 )

So yes, option D is correct.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and its mechanical energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its total energy is purely potential: 

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into kinetic energy. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the speed of the oscillator. Equating the total energy at equilibrium to the total energy at maximum displacement:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Simplifying for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because they either fail to account for relativistic energy conservation or misrepresent the relationship between \( v_{\text{max}} \), \( k \), \( A \), \( m \), and \( c \).

Answer: D
