Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, the question isn't about their masses directly, it's about their elemental abundances. Oh right, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. Let's list them out:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what's the notation [X/Y]? Oh right, the brackets mean logarithmic abundance ratios relative to a reference. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the log abundance of Fe relative to H compared to the solar value.

So I think I can use these to find the abundances of Si in each star, then take the ratio.

First, let's tackle Star_1.

Star_1: [Fe/H] = 0. This means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So Fe/H for Star_1 is the same as solar.

Wait, no, wait. The [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) - (Fe/H)_sun. Because [Fe/H] = log( (Fe/H) / (Fe/H)_sun ). So if [Fe/H]_1 = 0, that means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So Star_1 has solar Fe abundance.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe ratio) - log(solar Si/Fe ratio) = 0.3.

Wait, so the solar ratio is (nSi/nFe)_sun. Let me compute that from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data gives nFe/nH and nMg/nH. But I need nSi/nFe or something like that. Maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of their [X/H] values.

Wait, let me think. For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1 ) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But I know that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Hmm, but wait, nH in the star is not necessarily the same as in the Sun. Or is it? I think in stellar atmospheres, H is the dominant element, so nH is roughly the same in both stars as a fraction of the total, but perhaps the absolute number depends on the star's size. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the total H abundance is the same as solar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of their logarithms.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^(0.3).

But from [Fe/H]_1 = 0, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but for the photosphere, nH is the number density of hydrogen. Since the total number of hydrogen might vary depending on the star's size, but when taking ratios, perhaps it's okay.

Let me compute the solar nSi/nFe. Wait, do I have the solar abundance of Si? Hmm, the sun's data gives [nFe/nH] and [nMg/nH], but not Si. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I can get the solar [Si/Fe] ratio from other information.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the solar [Si/Fe] is zero because it's the reference. Wait, no, because [X/Y] is defined relative to the Sun. So [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that the ratio Si/Fe is 10^0.3 times higher than solar.

Wait, but without knowing the solar [Si/Fe], which is zero, that would mean in Star_1, Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun. So in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is 0, so Si/Fe is equal to solar's ratio.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the solar [Si/Fe] ratio.

But the Sun's data only gives Fe and Mg abundances. Hmm, so perhaps I can't find the solar Si/Fe ratio directly. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So perhaps I can express [nSi_1 / nSi_2] and find that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as solar. And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So [Si/Fe] = log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But because [Fe/H]_1 = 0, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

So, let me find (nSi_1 / nH_1) in terms of solar values.

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3,

(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^(0.3).

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1,

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^(0.3) )

Substitute nFe_1,

nSi_1 = ( (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 ) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 )

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

But (nSi_sun / nH_sun) is the solar [Si/H] ratio, but wait, no, [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, [X/H] is zero for the Sun. So for the Sun, log(nX/nH) = 12 + something? Wait, no, the given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH = 1e-5 for the Sun.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? Hmm, the problem doesn't give that. Oh wait, perhaps I can get it from [Si/Fe]_sun, which is zero.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log( (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) - log( nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) = 0 → which doesn't help. So perhaps I can't get the solar [Si/H] ratio directly.

Wait, maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H].

Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H]. Because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], right?

Wait, let me think. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Which can be written as [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], because [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log_solar, and [Y/H] is same for Y.

Wait, so [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1.

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Si/Fe] = [Si/H]_1 → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1.

So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3. Which means log( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

So [nSi_1/nH_1] = 10^0.3 * [nSi_sun/nH_sun].

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) is 10^0.3 times higher than solar.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Wait, rearranging that equation:

0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, because [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log( (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = -0.3 → nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * 10^(-0.3).

So now, to find the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, but how? Because nH varies between the stars and the Sun.

Wait, but the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = (10^0.3 * solar_ratio) / (10^-0.3 * solar_ratio) ) → the solar ratios cancel.

Wait, wait, let's make it more precise.

So,

nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

nSi_2 / nH_2 = 10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1 / nH_1) * nH_2 ] / [ (nSi_2 /nH_2) * nH_1 ]

Which becomes:

(10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) * nH_2 ) / (10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) * nH_1 )

The (nSi_sun /nH_sun) terms cancel out, so we get:

(10^0.3 * nH_2) / (10^-0.3 * nH_1 )

Which is 10^(0.3 + 0.3) * (nH_2 / nH_1 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH_2 / nH_1 )

But wait, we don't know the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2. Are they the same?

Hmm, perhaps in the photosphere of a star, the number density of hydrogen depends on the star's pressure and temperature. But without additional information, maybe the problem assumes that the number density of hydrogen is the same in both stars? Or perhaps the ratio depends on the mass or other factors.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the photospheric H density or the stars' sizes. So perhaps I should assume that nH_1 = nH_2, i.e., the number density of hydrogen is the same in both stars. Alternatively, maybe each star's nH is proportional to their mass, but I don't think that's necessarily true.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the definition of [X/H]. [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So, for each star, (nX/nH) is known relative to solar.

But when taking the ratio of [nSi_1 / nH_1] to [nSi_2 /nH_2], which is (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), this would be (nSi_1 nH_2 ) / (nSi_2 nH_1 ). But without knowing the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2, I can't proceed. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the mass fractions or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the number of silicon atoms in their photospheres is the same as the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which would require knowing how H varies.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio nH_1 = nH_2. But that's an assumption, and the problem doesn't state that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon can be found in terms of [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, wait, perhaps the ratio of Si in the photosphere is (nSi_1) / (nSi_2) = (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2 /nH_1) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2) * (nH_2 /nH_1) )... No, wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen. Because the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which would be (nSi_1 /nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), multiplied by (nH_2 /nH_1 ), but again, without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem states that the photospheric composition is given, and perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars. Or maybe I should assume that the number of H atoms is the same, so nH_1 = nH_2.

If that's the case, then the ratio of silicon would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ) → but if nH_2 = nH_1, this would just be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) → which is (10^0.3 ) / (10^-0.3 ) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately option A) ~3.9.

But wait, why would nH_1 and nH_2 be the same? They should depend on the star's characteristics, like temperature and pressure. But perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, so nH_1 = nH_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mass fractions rather than number densities. Because in stellar atmospheres, sometimes the mass fraction is considered, but the question says number density.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me try another angle.

The ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) * (nH_2 / nH_1 ).

But perhaps I can express nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of the Sun's nH.

Wait, from Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → (nFe_1 /nH_1 ) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg_2 /nH_2 ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ).

But I'm not sure how this helps with nH_1 and nH_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the ratio of Si relative to H in each star, and then the ratio of those two values.

Wait, the question is: the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, perhaps the question is (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which is the ratio of their [Si/H] values.

But [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → So the ratio would be 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3) =10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is about 3.9, option A.

But wait, why would it be that ratio? Because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, the ratio is 10^0.3 /10^(-0.3) =10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

So the answer would be approximately ~3.9, option A.

But wait, the problem isn't asking for [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2. It's asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So more precisely, the number of Si atoms per unit volume in Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Which is (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) divided by (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), multiplied by (nH_2 /nH_1 ), because nSi_1 / nH_1 is (Si per H) for Star 1, and nSi_2 /nH_2 is (Si per H) for Star 2.

Wait, so the ratio would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) × (nH_2 /nH_1 ) = (nSi_1 nH_2) / (nSi_2 nH_1 ).

But without knowing the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2, this approach doesn't work. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the absolute number of H atoms but the ratio of Si relative to H in each star. Because the problem gives [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], but perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log( (Fe/H)_1 ) - log(Fe/H)_sun =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 =10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

But since (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun, then (Fe)_1 = (Fe)_sun × (H)_1 / (H)_sun.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of nSi_1 to nH_1 is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) × 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

But [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Given [Mg/H]_2=0 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But this is the same as earlier, which would be option A.

Wait, but this ratio is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) → which means for each H atom in their respective photospheres, Star_1 has 10^0.6 times more Si than Star_2.

But the problem is asking for the ratio of Si atoms in their photospheres. So if the number of H atoms is the same in both, then this ratio directly gives the ratio of Si atoms. But if the number of H atoms is different, then this ratio would be scaled by (nH_2/nH_1 ).

But since the problem doesn't provide any data on H density, I think the intended approach is to assume that the H density is the same in both stars. Or perhaps the ratio is simply the ratio of [Si/H] as I calculated.

So putting it all together, the ratio is about 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Definitions and Data:
1. **[X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ) - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)_{sun}**
   - This measures the logarithmic abundance of element X relative to Y compared to solar values.

2. **Star_1:**
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → (Fe/H)₁ = (Fe/H)_{sun}.
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)₁ = 10^{0.3} × (Si/Fe)_{sun}.

3. **Star_2:**
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → (Mg/H)₂ = (Mg/H)_{sun}.
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)₂ = 10^{0.3} × (Mg/Si)_{sun}.

4. **Solar Photospheric Composition:**
   - log₁₀(nFe/nH)_{sun} = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^{-4.5}.
   - log₁₀(nMg/nH)_{sun} = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^{-5}.

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Each Star
Using the relationship [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], we compute [Si/H] for both stars.

#### For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁.
- [Fe/H]₁ = 0 (given), so [Si/H]₁ = 0.3.

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂.
- [Mg/H]₂ = 0 (given), so [Si/H]₂ = -0.3.

### Step 2: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Si/H]}_1}{\text{[Si/H]}_2} = \frac{10^{\text{[Si/H]}_1}}{10^{\text{[Si/H]}_2}} = 10^{\text{[Si/H]}_1 - \text{[Si/H]}_2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Step 3: Approximate the Ratio
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
