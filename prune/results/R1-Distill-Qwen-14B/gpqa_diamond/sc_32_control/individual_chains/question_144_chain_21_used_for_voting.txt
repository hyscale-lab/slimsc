Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given values are production energy E_X of 8 GeV, mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X of 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles like mesons don't always travel a long distance because they decay quickly. The decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying, right? And the lifetime is connected to the particle's width via the uncertainty principle.

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is given by the inverse of the width Γ. Something like τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the formula is actually τ = ħ/(Γ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's the other way around? Because I remember that a larger width means a shorter lifetime, since Γ is the energy uncertainty in the particle's mass. So if Γ is bigger, the lifetime is shorter.

But wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ has units of energy, so τ would be in seconds if ħ is in J·s. Let's check the units.

But how do I calculate the decay distance? Oh, right, the mean decay distance is the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime. So L = v * τ. But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes dilated. So I think I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ and multiply that by τ. So the mean proper lifetime is τ, but the observed lifetime is γτ. So the decay distance would be L = v * γ τ.

Wait, but how do I find v? Since the particle is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass, so it's moving relativistically. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). Wait, but in units where c=1, it's E/(m). But the units here are GeV for E and m, so I need to make sure I handle the units correctly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ = E / (m c²). But wait, E is given in GeV and m too. Since E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). But when working in units where c=1, it's just E/m.

Wait, but in the problem, E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = approximately 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667.

2. Calculate the mean lifetime τ. Since τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert units. Let me see. ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that ħ c is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but wait, that's when c is considered in units. Or, in terms of units, ħ in J·s. Let me think about converting everything into consistent units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But I'm not super confident. Alternatively, I can use the relation between decay width and mean lifetime.

Wait, in natural units where ħ = 1 and c=1, the lifetime τ is 1 / Γ. But when converting back to regular units, we have to account for the units of Γ. Since Γ is in MeV, which is energy, and τ is in seconds. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But to do this, I need the value of ħ in J·s. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert MeV into Joules.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 1.60218e-13 J.

So Γ_X = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = let me calculate that.

320e6 is 3.2e8. 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = approximately 5.12698e-11 J.

So Γ = 5.12698e-11 J.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (5.12698e-11) ≈ Let me compute that.

1.05457e-34 / 5.12698e-11 = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. But a high energy particle decaying quickly, makes sense.

Now, the decay distance L is v * τ. But since v is a relativistic speed, I should use v ≈ c, because for high-energy particles, v is very close to c. So v ≈ c = 3e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 6.17e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. Because I think I missed the Lorentz factor. Because the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, but from our frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor γ. So the observed lifetime is τ' = γ τ, so L = v * τ' = v γ τ.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The decay width Γ is related to the total decay rate, which in natural units is Γ = ħ / τ_total, where τ_total is the lifetime. So I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ, which is correct.

But then the mean lifetime observed is γ τ. So the decay length would be L = v * γ τ.

So let's recast.

We have:

Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.126e-11 J.

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So τ (proper time) = ħ / Γ = 1.05457e-34 / 5.126e-11 ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Then, the Lorentz factor γ is E_X / (m_X c²), but in units where c=1, γ = E_X / m_X. Since E_X is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So the observed lifetime is τ_obs = γ τ = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.37e-23 s.

Then, the speed v is approximately c, so v = 3e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ_obs = 3e8 m/s * 1.37e-23 s = 4.11e-15 meters.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. My calculation gives approximately 4.11e-15, which is close to option B but slightly higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the steps again.

Calculating τ (proper time):

Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

τ = ħ / Γ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 1.0545718e-34 divided by 5.126976e-11.

5.126976e-11 is 5.126976 * 1e-11.

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.126976) ) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 / 5.126976 ≈ approximately 0.2057.

So 0.2057e-23 = 2.057e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Now, γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So 6.666666667.

τ_obs = 6.666666667 * 2.057e-24 = 1.37e-23 s.

v is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 3e8 * 1.37e-23 = 4.11e-15 meters.

But the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So my calculated 4.11e-15 is closest to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation of v as c is a bit off. Let me think about the exact calculation of v.

Since E = γ m c², and v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))) ?

Wait, alternatively, beta (β) is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, yes: beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)), which is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) in natural units where c=1.

So for E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v = β c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, L = v * τ_obs = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37e-23 s.

Let me compute that:

2.966e8 * 1.37e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37) )e-15.

2.966 * 1.37: let's calculate.

2 * 1.37 = 2.74.

0.966 * 1.37: approximately 1.32142.

Total is approximately 2.74 + 1.32142 = 4.06142.

So L ≈ 4.06142e-15 m.

Which is around 4.06e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So that's the answer.

So the correct option is B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Equations and Concepts:
1. **Mean Lifetime (\( \tau \))**: The mean proper lifetime of the particle is given by the uncertainty principle:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]
   where \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant.

2. **Relativistic Lifetime (\( \tau_{\text{obs}} \))**: Due to time dilation, the observed lifetime is:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{obs}} = \gamma \tau
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
   \]
   In natural units (\( c = 1 \)), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m}
   \]

3. **Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))**: The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity and its observed lifetime:
   \[
   L = v \tau_{\text{obs}}
   \]
   For relativistic particles, \( v \approx c \), so:
   \[
   L = c \tau_{\text{obs}}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Decay Width (\( \Gamma \))**:  
   Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} \), convert to joules:
   \[
   \Gamma = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 5.12698 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))**:  
   Using \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.12698 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
   \]

4. **Observed Lifetime (\( \tau_{\text{obs}} \))**:  
   Using \( \tau_{\text{obs}} = \gamma \tau \):
   \[
   \tau_{\text{obs}} = 6.6667 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
   \]

5. **Velocity (\( v \))**:  
   For relativistic particles, \( v \approx c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). To refine \( v \), calculate \( \beta = v/c \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} \approx 0.9887
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

6. **Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))**:  
   Using \( L = v \tau_{\text{obs}} \):
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (1.37 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0614 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated decay distance (\( L \)) is approximately \( 4.0614 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.
