Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says the molecule is modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, I remember that in such models, the molecule can change both its rotational and vibrational states when it absorbs or emits a photon.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. But wait, what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh right, the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state (n=0) for vibration, and for rotation, the ground state is typically the lowest rotational quantum number, which is J=0. But wait, in some models, maybe J starts at 0 or higher? I think for diatomic molecules, the rotational states start at J=0, with each J corresponding to different rotational energy levels.

So the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, what's the next state after the fundamental? Oh, maybe it's the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But since the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy", that probably means the smallest possible energy increment. So probably a transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to the first excited state (n=1), and perhaps a change in rotation as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, and it can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The photon's energy needs to match either the vibrational transition or the rotational transition, whichever has lower energy delta.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", so perhaps it's the next energy level in terms of the overall energy, not just vibration or rotation. So I should find the energy difference between the current state (fundamental) and the next possible state, which could involve either vibration, rotation, or both.

Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is n=0 (vibration) and J=0 (rotation). The next state could either be increasing J by 1 (so J=1) while keeping n=0, or increasing n by 1 (n=1) while keeping J=0. Which transition requires less energy?

So I need to compute the energy differences for both transitions and see which one is lower.

First, let me think about the vibrational energy. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The fundamental state is n=0, so E_vib_initial = (1/2) h w. If it transitions to n=1, the change is E_vib_final - E_vib_initial = h w.

Next, the rotational energy. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * ħ² / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ r², with μ the reduced mass and r the bond length. So for J=0, the initial rotational energy is E_rot_initial = 0. If it transitions to J=1, the energy becomes E_rot_final = (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So the change in rotational energy would be E_rot_final - E_rot_initial = ħ²/(I). We need to compute that. Let me calculate I first.

The reduced mass μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY). Given mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But to compute I, I need μ in kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.014e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μ r² = 3.014e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.014e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is h-bar, which is h/(2π). Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s.

So E_rot change is ħ² / I = (1.054e-34)^2 / (1.2056e-46) = (1.110e-68) / (1.2056e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J. Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.054e-34 squared is (1.054)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.11 * 1e-68. Divided by 1.2056e-46:

(1.11e-68) / (1.2056e-46) = (1.11 / 1.2056) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change is h w. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two energy changes: rotational transition needs about 9.2e-23 J, vibrational transition is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition, because it's the lower energy change.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we're looking to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That would be the transition with the least energy difference. So the rotational transition is smaller, so that's the one we want.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation for the rotational energy change.

I'm calculating E_rot change as ħ²/(I). Let me compute ħ squared:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I is 1.112e-68 / 1.2056e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J. That seems correct.

And h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Yes.

So the rotational transition is much less energetic. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait wait, but in the problem, the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is J=0 and n=0. The next possible state could be either J=1 (same n=0) or n=1 (same J=0). The photon needs to have energy equal to the difference between these states.

So the photon's energy must be either E_rot (J=1) or E_vib (n=1). Since E_rot is smaller, the photon's energy should match that.

Wait, but wait, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change its state. So the energy of the photon should match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So the initial state is (n=0, J=0), and the final state is either (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0).

Which of these requires less energy? The (n=0, J=1) transition requires ΔE_rot ≈ 9.22e-23 J, while (n=1, J=0) requires ΔE_vib ≈ 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition has lower energy, so the photon's energy should be 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, another possibility: the molecule could transition to a state that is a combination, like (n=1, J=1). But that would require more energy, because both changes would add. So the minimal energy change is the rotational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy is ΔE_rot. Now, the question is about the momentum of the photon.

Wait, a photon's energy is E = p c, where p is the momentum, and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So, given E_rot = 9.22e-23 J, what is p?

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s which is 3.07e-31 N·s, since N·s is kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are around 3e-31. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the steps. Maybe the moment of inertia calculation is wrong.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So squared is 4e-20 m².

Reduced mass μ: mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.014, so 3.014e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r² = 3.014e-27 kg * (4e-20 m²) = 3.014e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

That seems correct. So ħ²/(2I) for J=1 is the rotational energy. Wait, no, the rotational energy for J=1 is [ ħ² (2(2+1)) ] / (2I) ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I). So for J=0, it's zero. For J=1, it's (ħ² * 2) / (2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So that's correct.

This gives E_rot = 9.22e-23 J. So p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are in the range of 1e-28 to 2e-27. Hmm, that's like 1e-28 is 1e-28, but this is 3e-31, which is three orders of magnitude smaller. Did I make a mistake in the exponents?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me compute ħ squared:

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68.

I is 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2056e-46) = (1.112 / 1.2056) * 1e-22.

Wait 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22. So 1.112 / 1.2056 ≈ 0.922.

So 0.922e-22 = 9.22e-23 J. Correct.

So E_rot is 9.22e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / (3e8) = (9.22 / 3) * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options don't have this. The smallest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is 1900e-30, which is about 600 times larger than 3e-31.

Hmm. Did I mess up a unit conversion?

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy using the vibrational energy formula? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia?

Wait, another possibility: the question says 'non-rigid rotor model' which I'm not too familiar with. Wait, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid (or vibrationally non-rigid) model, the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. Oh, because the bond length changes during vibration, the moment of inertia isn't constant. But does that affect the transition energy calculation?

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the moment of inertia is considered to be in its average vibrational state. Or perhaps the problem treats the moment of inertia as a function of the vibrational state. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure how that would affect the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the model considered here is the rigid rotor, and the non-rigid part refers to the fact that the molecule can vibrate, but for the purpose of rotational energy, they're treating it as rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (n=0, J=0). To switch to the next state, perhaps the molecule can go to J=1 (same n=0) or n=1 (same J=0). The problem is asking for the photon's momentum that allows this transition to the next state, which requires the lowest possible photon energy. So which transition has lower energy? As earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the one to choose.

But the photon's momentum is E/c, so if E is 9.22e-23 J, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in which energy I'm considering.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational transition, but a transition that includes both rotation and vibration. But that complicates things, and I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational? Because maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed for some reason, like selection rules. But I don't recall the specific selection rules for this model. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both rotational and vibrational states change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy difference between the rotational and vibrational ground states. Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state overall.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy difference between the vibrational ground state (n=0) and the next vibrational excited state (n=1), and ignore rotation. Let me see what that gives.

E_vib for n=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w. For n=1, it's (1 + 1/2) h w. So the change is (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. So that's much higher than the rotational transition.

But again, the photon's momentum would be E/c, which is 2.65e-19 /3e8 = ~8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is somewhat close but not exactly matching.

Hmm, but I'm not getting exactly any of the options. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), but also accounting for the vibrational energy change. No, that wouldn't make sense because the molecule is already in the vibrational ground state. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy change and see if any of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moment of inertia. Let me check the numbers again.

Mass of X: 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

Mass of Y: 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no. 2 amu is 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

So the reduced mass μ is ( (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) ) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute μ correctly.

μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY).

mX = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Calculating denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 → approx 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.653e-26 = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Ah, okay, same as before. So that part was correct.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is using the average bond length instead of the exact value. But 2 angstroms is given, so I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy as (J (J+1) ) * (h/(8π² I)) ) * (h²/(8 π² I)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the rotational energy formula. Let me double-check. The energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. So E_J = [ (h/(2π))^2 * J (J+1) ] / (2I) = [ h² J (J+1) ] / (8 π² I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = h² * 2 / (8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So E_rot = h² / (4 π² I).

Wait, let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Divided by (4 π² I) → 4 * (9.8696) * I → 4 * π² ≈ 39.478.

So 4 π² I = 39.478 * 1.2056e-46 kg·m² = approx 4.76e-45 kg·m².

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.76e-45 = approx 9.22e-23 J. Same as before.

So that's correct. So again, the energy for J=1 is 9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, which translates to p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s or N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. The smallest option is A) 1.9e-28 N·s, which is three orders of magnitude bigger.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else. Let me think about the model again.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering a pure rotational transition but a transition that includes both rotational and vibrational. Like, the molecule goes from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0). No, that would require the vibrational transition energy, which is higher.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule goes from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), which is the same as the rotational transition I computed, which requires E_rot.

But I'm not getting the right order of magnitude in the options. Wait, perhaps I should compute the angular momentum and then find the momentum, but that doesn't make sense because photons don't have angular momentum directly related to linear momentum in that way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy to calculate the photon's energy. Let me check.

E_vib is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. So p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s. So that's 8.83e-28 N·s. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that. So maybe I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy including both vibrational and rotational, but that's not the case because the molecule is in the fundamental state and we're looking for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dissociation energy or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me go over that again.

E_rot = (h²) / (8 π² I).

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

I is 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

So denominator is 8 * (π)^2 * I = 8 * 9.8696 * 1.2056e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2056e-46 ≈ 95.16e-46 = 9.516e-45.

So E_rot is 4.39e-67 / 9.516e-45 = approx 4.61e-23 J. Hmm, that's about 4.6e-23 J. Earlier, I had 9.22e-23 J, which is about double. So maybe I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the correct formula for rotational energy is E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I) ). Which is (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I) ). For J=1, it's (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

So E_rot = h^2 / (4 π² I).

So h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

4 π² I = 4 * 9.8696 * 1.2056e-46 = 4 * 9.8696 *1.2056e-46.

Compute 9.8696 *1.2056e-46: 9.8696 ≈ 10, so 10 *1.2056e-46 ≈1.2056e-45. Multiply by 4: 4.8224e-45.

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.8224e-45 = approx 9.1e-23 J.

Same as before. So same result, 9.1e-23 J.

But again, the momentum p is E/c = 9.1e-23 / 3e8 = 3.03e-31 kg·m/s.

Still, none of the options match this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a transition that includes both a change in vibrational and rotational state, but I don't think that would give a lower energy than the rotational transition alone.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which might involve both rotation and vibration. But that would require a larger energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given options are for a photon that has the same energy as the vibrational energy, and I'm miscalculating something. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe the question is about the rotational energy, not the vibrational. But again, the options don't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using E = h f, and then relate p to E. So p = h f /c = (h / c) f.

But since E = h f, then p = E / c.

So, if the photon's energy is E_rot = 9.22e-23 J, then p = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 N·s. But no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the relativistic energy formula? No, that doesn't make sense because the energy is way below the threshold for relativistic effects.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me recalculate μ.

mX = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = 3.321^2 * 1e-53 = 11.03 * 1e-53 =1.103e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.653e-26 = approx 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the total energy, including both rotation and vibration, but that doesn't seem to fit the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy, but the answer is not matching the options either.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) p = 1.9e-28 N·s

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of the vibrational quantum and see if any of the options match.

E_vib is h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, which is about 0.8 times that. Not too close, but perhaps I made a mistake in w? The given w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, maybe I should compute E in terms of w instead of w in terms of frequency. No, because E = h w is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational energy change but in a different way. For example, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the rotational energy is considered as part of the total energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

Yes, E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I). For J=1, E_rot = ħ² * 2 / (2 I) ) = ħ²/(I). Since ħ is h/(2π), ħ² = h²/(4π²).

So E_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

But I have I correct, so that's 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is not E/c, but related to angular momentum. But photons carry angular momentum, but that's a separate topic. The question is about linear momentum.

Wait, the linear momentum of a photon is p = E/c. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me compute it again numerically.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.2056e-46 kg·m².

E_rot = h² / (4 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * (π)^2 * 1.2056e-46)

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * (9.8696) * 1.2056e-46 = 4 *9.8696=39.4784; 39.4784 *1.2056e-46 = 47.57e-46 = 4.757e-45.

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.757e-45 = approx 9.23e-23 J.

So p = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = 3.076e-31 N·s.

Hmm, same result.

So why aren't the options matching? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. If it's a diatomic molecule modeled as a non-rigid rotor, perhaps the fundamental state includes both the vibrational and rotational ground states. The next state could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy should match that.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-31, which suggests I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have higher energy. But that's not the case because J=1 is the next state.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the total energy of the photon as the sum of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition but using a different formula.

Wait, let me think about the vibrational energy again. The energy of a photon needed to cause a vibrational transition is E = h w (n_final - n_initial). For n_initial=0, n_final=1, E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. So p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

But the options don't have that either. So perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but the answer is not in the options, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy in terms of the bond length and reduced mass.

Wait, another approach: compute the moment of inertia I.

I = μ r².

μ = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) = (20 * 2)/(20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Then, the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = (ħ^2 * 2 )/(2I) )= ħ^2/I.

ħ = h/(2π) = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²s².

E_rot = 1.112e-68 /1.204e-46 = approx 9.23e-23 J.

So p = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.076e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way off. So perhaps the question is asking for something else. Maybe I've missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia varies with vibration. So the rotational energy would depend on the vibrational state. But in the ground vibrational state (n=0), the bond length is fixed, so I is as computed earlier. So that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational angular frequency in the rotational energy calculation, which would be incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is not about the rotation-vibration model but the simple rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, where the molecule can only change either rotation or vibration, not both. So the photon must have enough energy to cause either a rotation or vibration transition. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one to choose.

But again, the math doesn't add up to any of the options.

Wait, maybe I should look for another way to express the rotational energy.

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I) → for J=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2 )/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

But ħ² is h²/(4π²).

So E_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

4 π² I =4*(9.8696)*(1.2056e-46) → 4 *9.8696 ≈39.478; 39.478 *1.2056e-46 =47.57e-46 =4.757e-45.

So E_rot =4.39e-67 /4.757e-45 = approx 9.23e-23 J.

Same as before.

So I'm confident that the rotational energy is 9.23e-23 J, leading to p≈3e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is considering a different approach, like using the vibrational energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require E = h w.

So p = E/c = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (2.65e-19)/3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the energy required for the transition, but about the photon's momentum when the molecule is excited to the next state. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy but considering the zero-point energy. But in that case, the energy difference would still be h w.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the angular frequency. Let me check the given value.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J. So p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the reduced mass in a different way, or perhaps the bond length is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, not the rotational. But why would the rotational transition not be the correct approach?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are not as simple as the rigid rotor model. So maybe the energy difference is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first rotational state and the first vibrational state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be based on the vibrational energy, and perhaps the options have a typo.

Given that, if the correct momentum is around 8.83e-28 N·s, but the closest option is A)1.9e-28, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is 4e13 rad/s, but that would make E=6.626e-34 *4e13=2.65e-20 J, p=8.83e-29 N·s. Again, not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculations point to a momentum around 3e-31 for rotational and 8.8e-28 for vibrational, neither of which are in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think about the rotational energy again.

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I).

Wait, for J=0 to J=1, the change is 2 * ħ² / (2I) = ħ²/I. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (mX * mY)/(mX + mY) = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Which is 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 is approx 3.018, so μ=3.018e-27 kg.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rotational energy is calculated using the moment of inertia for the rigid rotor, which is μ r². So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to a higher vibrational state, but why would that be the case if the rotational transition is lower energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy in terms of the dissociation energy, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

These are all much larger than the 3e-31 I calculated for rotational transition, but much smaller than the 8.8e-28 for vibrational.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum when it's absorbed during a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But I don't know the formula for that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the rotational energy is treated as part of the vibrational energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state of the vibration, which would require E = h w, giving p=8.8e-28. Since this isn't in the options, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as (mX + mY) r². But that would be incorrect, as the reduced mass is used for rotational energy, not the sum.

Wait, let me compute I using the sum of masses:

I = (mX + mY) r² = (20 +2) amu * (2e-10)^2.

But in kg, (22 amu) =22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.653e-26 kg.

r²=4e-20 m².

So I=3.653e-26 *4e-20 =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then, E_rot = h²/(4 π² I) → (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 π² *1.461e-45).

h²=4.39e-67.

4 π² I =4*9.8696*1.461e-45= approx 4*9.87=39.48; 39.48 *1.461e-45=57.63e-45 =5.763e-44.

E_rot=4.39e-67 /5.763e-44 =7.62e-24 J. So p=7.62e-24 /3e8=2.54e-32 N·s. Still not matching options.

So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is thinking of the moment of inertia as (mX * mY) r², which would be μ r², which is correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should go with the vibrational transition, even though the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Hmm, option A is 1.9e-28. That's about 0.21 times 8.83e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of w. Let me check: the question says w=4e14 rad/s. So E= h w is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is using w in terms of cm^-1 instead of rad/s. But that would complicate things, as w in spectroscopy is often expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1), but in this case, the question specifies w in rad/s, so I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing w with the frequency nu. No, the formula E = h w is correct, where w is angular frequency (2 π ν).

So I think I'm correct there.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as p= h/(lambda), but that's the same as E/c.

Wait, perhaps the given options are wrong, but I doubt that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy. Let me compute that.

E_rot for J=2: (ħ² * 6 )/(2I) )= 3 ħ²/I.

So E_rot=3*9.22e-23=2.766e-22 J. p=2.766e-22 /3e8=9.22e-31 kg·m/s.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong. All calculations point to the rotational transition requiring E=9.2e-23 J, p=3e-31 N·s, which is not an option.

So, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition and the answer is option A, but I don't know why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation, but I've double-checked that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy in a different manner, such as using the rigid rotor model with the bond length in a different unit. Let me check the bond length again.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in picometers. No, 2 angstroms is 200 pm, but that's the same as 2e-10 m.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given information and select the option that's closest to the vibrational transition, which is option A (1.9e-28), even though it's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the vibrational energy in terms of the rotational energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as the sum of the individual moments of each atom. So I = mX r² + mY r² = (mX + mY) r². Which, as I tried earlier, gives I =3.653e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.653e-26 *4e-20 =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then, E_rot for J=1 would be (ħ² * 2)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

So ħ is 1.05457e-34.

So ħ² = 1.112e-68.

I=1.461e-45.

E_rot =1.112e-68 /1.461e-45 =7.61e-24 J.

p=7.61e-24 /3e8 =2.54e-32 N·s. Still way too small.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Without further information, I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (n=0, J=0) state to the (n=1, J=1) state, which would require both a vibrational and rotational transition. But that would involve more energy, not less.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=2), which would require higher energy.

But all these possibilities don't align with the given options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula E = (h c)/lambda, but that's the same as E = h f.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy in terms of the photon's wavelength, but that doesn't change the momentum calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the photon's energy in terms of the bond's potential energy. But I don't have enough information about the potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next possible energy state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure how to calculate that.

In the absence of any other ideas, I think the correct answer is option A) 1.9e-28 N·s, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer based on the vibrational energy, which would give p=8.8e-28, but the closest option is A)1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib. Let me compute it again.

h=6.626e-34, w=4e14.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

But the option closest is A)1.9e-28. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using w as 1e14 instead of 4e14? That would give E=6.626e-34 *1e14=6.626e-20 J. p=2.2e-28 N·s. Closer to option A.

But the given w is 4e14, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to give w as 1e14, but it's written as 4e14. But I can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the change in rotational energy plus the change in vibrational energy, which would be 9.2e-23 +2.65e-19= ~2.75e-19 J. p= 9.17e-28 N·s. Still not matching.

Hmm.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct approach is to select the smallest energy transition, which is the rotational one. Since the options don't match, I'll assume that perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 N·s, perhaps due to a miscalculation elsewhere.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**:  
   The molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). The energy differences for these transitions are calculated as follows:
   - **Vibrational Transition**:  
     The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \). The energy difference between \( n=0 \) (ground state) and \( n=1 \) (first excited state) is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Rotational Transition**:  
     The rotational energy levels for a rigid rotor are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 J (J+1)}{2I} \), where \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia. For \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \), the energy difference is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
     \]
     The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu})(2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.014 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.014 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2056 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
     Using \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), the rotational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2056 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Comparison of Transitions**:  
   The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition requires significantly less energy, so the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

3. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   This value does not match any of the provided options. Recalculating for the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   The closest option to this value is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**, though it is smaller by a factor of approximately 4.6. Despite this discrepancy, option A is the most reasonable choice among those provided.

**Answer: A**
