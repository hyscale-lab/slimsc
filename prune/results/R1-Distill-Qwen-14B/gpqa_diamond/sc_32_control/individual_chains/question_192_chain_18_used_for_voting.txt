Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are larger than R, so P is outside the conductor.

I remember that when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's induced charges come into play. But wait, the conductor itself was initially uncharged. So when you put the charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge, right?

Wait, no. Wait, if the conductor was neutral, and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is neutral overall. But wait, that's when the cavity is at the center, isn't it? Here, the cavity is off-center. Hmm, does that change anything significant?

Oh, right, because the conductor is a conductor, the charges will redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. But because the cavity is not at the center, the distribution might be a bit different. However, I think that the net effect is that the conductor's outer surface will have a charge of zero because the conductor was initially neutral. Wait, no, because the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it, right? Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero?

Wait, no. No, because the conductor's total charge is zero. The charges in the conductor are free to move. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) will have -q. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, right? No wait, because the conductor's net charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge equal to +q? Wait, no, because the initial charge of the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero?

Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. The inner is -q, so the outer must be +q. Wait, no, that would give a total charge of zero: -q + (+q) = 0. Oh, right, so the outer surface has a charge of +q.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in some cases, the outer charge can be determined based on the cavity's content. So in the case where the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the charge inside the cavity. So if the charge in the cavity is +q, the outer surface must be +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. Because the inner surface is -q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially neutral. Then, when you add +q inside, the conductor's inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface then has +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero: inner (-q) + outer (+q) = 0.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q. So now, when considering the electric field outside the conductor (since point P is outside), the field is due to the outer charge, right? Because the inner charge (-q) is inside the conductor, and the conductor shields its interior from the external fields.

Wait, but wait. When you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge were placed at the center of the conductor. Because the induced charges on the outer surface are such that their distribution depends only on the net charge outside, which in this case is +q.

Wait, no, because the outer surface has +q, but the conductor itself is a sphere. So the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution if it were a spherical conductor. But in this case, the cavity is not at the center, so the outer surface charge distribution might not be uniform. Hmm, but wait, the conductor is spherical, so the outer surface would be a sphere. So regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface would still have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere. Or no?

Wait, no. The conductor is a sphere, but the inner cavity is off-center. So the induced charges on the inner surface would be non-uniform, but the outer surface would still be a sphere. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface must be a sphere. So the charge on the outer surface would distribute uniformly because any external charge on a spherical conductor distributes uniformly regardless of the internal arrangement. Wait, that's a key point.

So, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's distributed uniformly because it's a spherical conductor. So, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) would be the same as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. Because the field outside a uniformly charged sphere is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but wait. Point P is at a point outside the conductor, so the field at P is due to the outer charge. The outer charge is +q, and the distances given are to the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. Because the outer charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

But wait, the charge +q is on the outer surface, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, which is the same as the distance from the center of the outer surface. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B says that, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

But wait, looking back, I might have made a mistake. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but what about the displacement of the cavity? The setup says that the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, but L is the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere with radius R, and P is outside. The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge outside, not on any internal charges. So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface will have charge +q, and the field outside will be the same as if the charge +q were at the center.

Wait, but if the charge is not at the center, why would the field outside be as if it's at the center? Because the outer surface is uniformly charged, so the field due to it is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, yes. Because even if the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface charge is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside depends only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center.

Therefore, the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B. So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is displaced by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) develops an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must develop a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, and the charge $+q$ on it distributes uniformly. This is a fundamental property of spherical conductors, where the charge on the outer surface is independent of the internal arrangement of charges.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface has a uniform charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (outside the conductor) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The displacement of the cavity (i.e., the distance $s$ and the angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the outer surface charge distribution is uniform and depends only on the total charge $+q$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}$ is not relevant because the electric field outside depends only on $L$, not on $l$ or $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$ matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}$ is not relevant for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$ is incorrect because the electric field depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
