Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I think this has to do with the uncertainty principle. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in time (Δt). The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, maybe it's more like ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but I think for this problem, the exact factor isn't as important as the scaling.

So the lifetimes here are the times that the states exist before decaying, I suppose. The uncertainty in time Δt would be related to how long each state lives. But wait, each state has a different lifetime. How does that affect the energy uncertainty?

Wait, maybe I should think of the energy uncertainty for each state. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty in energy because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1 with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 sec), its energy uncertainty ΔE1 would be larger, and for E2 with a longer lifetime (1e-8 sec), ΔE2 would be smaller.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. We want to clearly distinguish them, so the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty needs to be small enough that the two energy levels don't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of each state. Because if the energy difference is bigger than each state's uncertainty, then the two levels can be resolved. Otherwise, they might blend together.

Let me think again. The energy levels can be distinguished if the energy difference is larger than the order of magnitude of the uncertainties in each energy. So for each state, ΔE is about ħ/(2Δt). Let's compute that.

First, I need to find ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but the options are given in eV. Oh right, I need to convert everything into eV. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So let's convert ħ into eV·s.

Calculating ħ in eV·s: 1.05e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.55e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE for each state is approximately ħ/(2Δt). Let me compute for each state.

For E1: Δt1 is 1e-9 sec.

ΔE1 ≈ (6.55e-16 eV·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.55e-16) / (2e-9) ≈ 3.275e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2: Δt2 is 1e-8 sec.

ΔE2 ≈ (6.55e-16) / (2e-8) = (6.55e-16)/(2e-8) ≈ 3.275e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so actually, the uncertainty in energy for each state is inversely proportional to their lifetime. So the longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty.

Now, the two energy levels can be distinguished if their energy difference is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then the two states don't overlap, so you can tell them apart.

So the minimal energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, let's compute that. ΔE1 is about 3.275e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.275e-8 eV. So sum is roughly 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. Option A is 1e-9, which is smaller than 3.275e-7, so that's way too small. Option B is 1e-11, even smaller. D is 1e-8, which is about 0.1 times ΔE1, so still smaller than the sum.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or just each individually? Hmm. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. But the separation between E1 and E2 should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, I think. Because if one uncertainty is much larger, the other uncertainty may not matter as much. Or perhaps the product of the two?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy difference being larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement, which is the minimum uncertainty that you can resolve.

But maybe the correct approach is to use the uncertainty principle for the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference would be related to the time uncertainty of the system. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE needs to be greater than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. So for E1, ΔE1 is about 3.27e-7 eV, and E2's ΔE is 3.27e-8 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be at least larger than the larger of these two, which is 3.27e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, none of them are in that range. The options go up to 1e-4 eV. Wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is much larger than 3.27e-7.

Wait, 3.27e-7 eV is 0.327e-6, which is 0.327 micro-eV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro-eV. So much larger. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, that's much larger than the required minimum.

Wait, but the question is about being able to clearly distinguish the two levels. So any energy difference larger than the sum of the uncertainties would be sufficient. Since option C is way larger than that sum, it's a valid answer.

But wait, let's check the options again. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV

B) 1e-11 eV

C) 1e-4 eV

D) 1e-8 eV

The required energy difference for clear distinction should be at least larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. The sum is about 3.6e-7 eV. So any option larger than that would work.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7. Options A is 1e-9, which is smaller. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.1e-7, also smaller than 3.6e-7.

So option C is the only one that's larger than the needed sum. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). Converting \( \hbar \) to electron volts·seconds (\( \text{eV·s} \)):

\[
\hbar \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}.
\]

For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

### Calculations for Each State:
1. **For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):**
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.55 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.275 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):**
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.55 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.275 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Energy Difference for Distinguishability:
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{required}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{required}} > 3.275 \times 10^{-7} + 3.275 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)):** This is smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)):** This is also smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)):** This is much larger than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)):** This is smaller than \( 3.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The only energy difference that satisfies the requirement is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
