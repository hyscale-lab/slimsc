Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down what's happening here.

The researcher made a plasmid where the GADD45G gene has a hemagglutinin tag added to the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine, which is a common method for transfecting cells. They selected for antibiotic resistance, so the cells that didn't take up the plasmid probably died, leaving colonies that have the plasmid.

But when they checked the protein expression, it wasn't there as expected. So they're looking for the reason. Now, looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out what's wrong.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA tag. So the HA sequence might have a wrong amino acid. If that's the case, maybe the protein is expressed but the tag is messed up, making it hard to detect with antibodies. But wait, the problem is overexpression isn't happening—maybe the protein isn't made at all. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: Ribosome stops early. That would mean a premature stop codon somewhere. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA in the coding sequence, the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. But wait, the plasmid was constructed with the HA tag at the N-terminus. So if the construct is correct, the start codon should be at the beginning.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the start is ATG (position 1), which is methionine, the standard start codon. Then the next codons would be TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), etc. Wait a second—so the HA tag is added before the GADD45G sequence. Oh wait, no—the sequence provided is the coding sequence with the HA tag. Or is it? Wait, the construct includes the HA tag as the first part of the protein.

Wait, looking at the sequence: It starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then CGA (arginine), etc. Wait, but the HA tag is a specific sequence. Maybe the HA tag is part of the coding sequence. Let me think: HA is from influenza, so the amino acid sequence is HAHA... but in the DNA, the added HA tag would be at the N-terminus. So the plasmid's coding sequence starts with HA tag followed by GADD45G.

Wait no, the construct starts with coding for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the first few codons should be the HA tag. But looking at the given sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC (tyrosine), which is part of the HA tag. Let me recall the HA tag's amino acid sequence. Influenza HA tag is usually YPYDHHHHH (or similar), perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's just the HA peptide, which is a short sequence. The HA tag typically has the sequence YPYD (from HA1) followed by a few more amino acids. But the DNA sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... Let's translate the beginning.

ATG is Met. Then TAC is Tyr. CCA is Pro. TAC is Tyr again. GAT is Asp. GTA is Val. TCC is Ser. (Wait, wait, let's write out the first few codons.)

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA ...3'

Translating each triplet into amino acids:

ATG → Met

TAC → Tyr

CCA → Pro

TAC → Tyr

GAT → Asp

GTA → Val

TCC → Ser

AGA → Arg

So the amino acid sequence starts Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Ser-Arg...

Wait, that doesn't look like the HA tag. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. The HA tag's DNA sequence is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Let's think about the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA1 region starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA. Wait, maybe that's the HA tag. Oh wait, no. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYD (Y is Tyr, P is Pro, Y is Tyr, D is Asp). So the DNA for YPYD would be TAC CCA TAC GAT. Let me check:

TAC → Tyr (Y)

CCA → Pro (P)

TAC → Tyr (Y)

GAT → Asp (D)

So the first four amino acids are YPYD, which is the HA tag. So the initial part of the DNA is correct. So the HA tag's coding sequence is correct. So option A, a missense mutation in HA, would mean that one of these codons is changed. But looking at the sequence, the first few codons look correct. So maybe A isn't the issue.

Option B: The ribosome stops early. That would require a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the coding sequence. If the construct has a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated and perhaps not detected. But looking at the given sequence, I don't see any in frame stop codons.

Wait, let's look at the sequence. The sequence is given as the plus strand, 5' to 3', which is the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this. So the mRNA would be 3' to 5', with the same reading frame.

So the start is ATG, and the next is TAC, which is in frame. Let me scan for any stop codons. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA in DNA (but wait, on the plus strand, the stop codons are TAA (which is complementary to ATT), TAG (complementary to ATC), and TGA (complementary to TCA). So in the plus strand, I'm looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA as part of the coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence.

I'll scan the sequence:

Looking at triplets:

After the start, I see TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CCG... Wait, TTA is Leu. Then CCG is Pro. Then CCA is Pro. Then ATG is Met. Hmm.

Wait, in the middle, is there a TGA? Let me search for TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TGA.

Looking through:

...GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACG...

Ah, here's TGAAA. Wait, no, the triplet is TGA. Let me check:

Looking at the positions:

Looking for "TGA" in the DNA sequence. Let's see:

In the sequence, I found "TGA" in positions where? Let's see:

Looking, perhaps towards the middle.

Breaking the sequence into triplets:

Let's take a segment:

...GAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGG...

Wait, the triplet here is TGA, but looking at the letters:

Looking at the triplet at positions where.

Wait, perhaps the last part: ...TTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the very end is GAGTGA. So the last few triplets are GAG TGA. So the triplet TGA is present.

So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the DNA sequence ends with TGA. So in the mRNA, it would be UAC, which is a stop codon.

Wait, wait, no. The DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is complementary. The mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the stop codon in mRNA would be UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Wait, the coding sequence in the plus strand is TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So this is a problem.

So the construct includes a stop codon at the end, right? Because the GADD45G gene's coding sequence would end with a stop codon. But in this case, the provided sequence is the coding sequence with the HA tag. So perhaps the vector includes a termination codon, or perhaps the construct is designed correctly.

Wait, wait, but the given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon in DNA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early because there's a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence.

Wait, does it? Let me check where the TGA is. Let me count the letters:

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CCG CCA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GT C GC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA G... etc., and near the end, ...GAG TGA.

Wait, no, let me look again. The entire sequence is:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Looking for TGA: Let's see.

Looking at the end: ...GAGTGA. So the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but where is this in the coding sequence. The GADD45G gene's coding sequence would end with the stop codon. But in this construct, perhaps the HA tag is added, and then the GADD45G coding sequence. So the entire construct is HA-tag followed by GADD45G, including its stop codon. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the GADD45G CDS ends with a stop codon. So the overall construct would have a stop codon at the end.

Wait, but that shouldn't be a problem. The HA tag is added, so the start is ATG (Met) for the HA tag, followed by the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence, including its own stop codon. So the construct would have a single stop codon at the end. So the ribosome would translate until the end. So why is there a stop codon in the middle?

Wait, maybe in the provided sequence, the TGA is in the middle. Let me check the middle again. For example, somewhere around GCT GCT GTC GGC GCAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC... Wait, the TGA is here. So at position ...TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA... So the triplet TGA is present here. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop here, before the construct's end. So the HA tag is added, but the GADD45G coding sequence hasn't even started yet. Wait, no—the HA tag is the first part.

Wait, the construct starts with the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence. So if in the middle of the HA tag, there's a stop codon, the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that's just the HA tag start but not the full GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the stop codon comes after some part of the HA tag and part of the GADD45G. So the HA is correctly started, and then during translation, the ribosome hits a stop codon, so the protein is not made beyond that.

That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed. The stop codon is in the middle of the coding sequence, causing premature termination.

So option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if the construct has an in-frame stop codon. So looking at the sequence, there's a TGA in the middle, which is a stop codon (UGA in mRNA). So the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated and possibly not detected because it's too short or not functional.

So the mistake is that the construct has an in-frame TGA (stop codon) in the middle of the coding sequence. So the ribosome stops, and the protein isn't expressed. Therefore, the problem is that the ribosome stops early, which is option B.

Wait, but why would a stop codon be present in the middle of the construct? That would mean that either the construct was designed incorrectly, or there was a mutation introduced during cloning.

In the given scenario, the researcher designed the construct to add the HA tag to the N-terminus of GADD45G. If during the cloning, an extra TGA was introduced, that would cause this issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the original GADD45G gene already had a stop codon, but that's unlikely because the coding sequence for the gene would normally end with a stop codon, and if the construct appends that, it would end correctly.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the original GADD45G coding sequence would presumably be followed by its own stop codon. So in the construct, after the HA tag, the GADD45G sequence starts, and the stop codon is at the end.

Ah, but in the given sequence, the stop codon is in the middle, before the GADD45G sequence ends. So perhaps during cloning, an extra TGA was introduced, causing the premature stop.

So the problem is that there's a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, leading to a truncated protein. So the correct answer is option B.

Looking at the other options:

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. That would lead to the protein being degraded after synthesis. But the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed at all, not that it's present but degraded. So this might not be the reason.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, tRNAs recognize codons, not anticodons. The stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So option D is incorrect because there's no tRNA for stop codons; instead, release factors cause termination. So D is not the issue.

Option A: Missense in HA. That would affect the HA tag's structure but not prevent expression. Unless the HA tag is messed up, but the main issue is that the protein isn't expressed. So A is unlikely.

So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early because there's a premature stop codon in the construct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag in a transgenic mouse model but is unable to detect the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the construct. This stop codon is in frame and would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein. This explains why the protein is not being overexpressed as expected.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would affect the tag's structure but would not prevent the protein from being expressed. Since the issue is a lack of overexpression, this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **Option B**: The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein. This aligns with the observed lack of overexpression and is the most plausible explanation.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, but this would not prevent the protein from being expressed. The issue here is the absence of expression, not degradation, making this option unlikely.
- **Option D**: There is no tRNA for stop codons because stop codons are not translated by tRNAs; instead, they are recognized by release factors. This makes this option incorrect.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature stop codon in the coding sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early.
