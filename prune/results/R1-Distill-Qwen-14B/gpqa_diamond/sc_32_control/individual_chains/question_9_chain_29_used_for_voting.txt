Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what C3h symmetry means. Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The "C" stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means it has a three-fold rotation axis. The "h" stands for horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation symmetry and also a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Wait, I think C3h is also known as trigonal symmetry, right? So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have a mirror plane cutting through it. Now, looking at the options, which ones are likely to have this symmetry.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I need to think about each molecule's structure.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I think that's a borate with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure of triisopropyl borate is [B(OiPr)3], where OiPr is an isopropyl oxygen. The boron is at the center with three identical isopropyl groups. So each isopropyl is a symmetric group. If the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around the boron, then it might have a three-fold rotation axis. Let me visualize it: each isopropyl group is attached to B, and their positions are 120 degrees apart. So rotation by 120 degrees would bring each group into the position of the next. That suggests C3 symmetry. But wait, does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then maybe a horizontal mirror plane exists. Alternatively, in some cases, the molecule might be non-planar, but the symmetry would still include a horizontal mirror. Wait, actually, the molecule is trigonal pyramidal, I think. Oh wait, no, wait: triisopropyl borate has B with three OCH(CH2CH3)2 groups attached. So the structure is trigonal planar? Or maybe tetrahedral? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, the borate ion is [B(Oâˆ’R)3], where R is isopropyl. Boron typically has a trigonal planar geometry in such compounds. So the central boron is surrounded by three oxygen atoms, each attached to isopropyl groups. So the molecule would be trigonal planar, which has a C3 rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, in a trigonal planar molecule, if it's symmetric, there should be a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (the C3 axis) that acts as a mirror plane. So that would imply C3h symmetry. So option C might be a candidate.

Now, looking at option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think. Its structure is a norbornane derivative, which has a bridge structure. It's been a while since I thought about its symmetry. Let me imagine its structure. Quinuclidine has two rings: a six-membered ring fused with a five-membered ring, I think. Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine is also known as norbornane, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So quinuclidine would have a similar structure but with one more member. Or wait, perhaps it's bicyclo[2.2.2]octane? No, that would be cubane. Hmm, maybe I should think about the symmetry. Quinuclidine has a bridge, so it's not symmetric in a way that would have a three-fold axis. I think it's more of a tricyclic compound with a different symmetry. Maybe C2 symmetry? Or maybe no symmetry at all. So D probably doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Trifuran suggests three furan rings connected. The numbering might be a bit tricky. So benzo attached to a trifuran system. The name suggests that the benzo group is fused at certain positions. I'm not exactly sure about the structure. But in any case, benzo rings are usually symmetric, but with three substituents, perhaps it's not C3h. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for three-fold symmetry, but I think this might be more of a three-fold arrangement with a mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a benzene ring with substituents. But I'm not too confident about this one.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. So the structure would have three phenyl groups connected to a trifuran system. If the phenyl groups are attached in a symmetric fashion, perhaps at 120-degree intervals, then the molecule could have C3 symmetry. And if there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would make it C3h. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that each phenyl is placed symmetrically, leading to a three-fold axis.

Wait, but triphenyleno sounds like three phenyl groups attached to the furan rings. If they're placed in a trigonal arrangement around a central point, then yes, that could give C3 symmetry. But do they have a mirror plane? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C3 axis, then yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the other options have higher symmetry. Let me think again about triisopropyl borate. If the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might have a C3 axis. But wait, is the molecule planar? Because if it's planar, then the C3 axis is in the plane, and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to it would be out of the plane. Wait, I'm confusing myself. Maybe I should think in terms of point groups.

The C3h point group consists of a C3 axis with a horizontal mirror plane(s) perpendicular to it. So the molecule must have a three-fold rotation symmetry and at least one horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: The structure is B with three O-isopropyl groups. Each O is attached to B, so the molecule is trigonal planar. So the arrangement is similar to a flat triangle. So when you rotate 120 degrees, each group moves into the next position. Therefore, this would have a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror would be a plane that passes through some part of the molecule. In a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, there are three mirror planes, each passing through a bond and the opposite direction. But wait, in this case, the molecule is [BO(iPr)3]. So, it's trigonal planar, which has a C3 axis and three mirror planes (each containing one of the BOiPr axes). Wait, no, actually, in trigonal planar geometry, the point group is D3h, which includes a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, wait, no. Let me correct myself. The point group for trigonal planar is D3h if there's a horizontal mirror plane. But wait, no, wait. In fact, BF3 has a point group of D3h. Because it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis at the B atom). So yes, if the molecule is trigonal planar with a horizontal mirror plane, it would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So, option C would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, I'm getting confused. The point group D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane, which would mean that the molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it has C3h symmetry. So that would make option C correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the borate ion is trigonal planar. Boron typically has a trigonal planar structure when bonded to three atoms in the case of BF3. But in the case of triisopropyl borate, each substituent is an O-isopropyl group. So the molecule is still trigonal planar. So yes, it would have D3h symmetry, meaning it has C3h symmetry. So option C is a candidate.

Now, looking at the other options:

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. I'm not exactly sure about this structure, but if it's a benzo ring fused to a trifuran, perhaps the symmetry isn't three-fold. Alternatively, benzo rings usually have Dnh symmetry, but when fused to other rings, the symmetry might be lower. So probably, this molecule doesn't have a three-fold axis.

Option A: triphenyleno[... ]trifuran... So three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the three phenyl groups are placed symmetrically, perhaps at 120 degrees each, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. And if there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, it would be C3h. But I'm not certain. For example, some steroids have such symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a plane, so a mirror plane exists.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I should focus on the options I'm more certain about. So option C, triisopropyl borate, is a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So that's a good candidate.

Wait, but what about option A? Let's think again. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. If they are arranged symmetrically, say at 120 degrees, then the molecule would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? For example, in benzene, each carbon is symmetric, but when substituents are attached, maybe a mirror plane exists. Suppose the molecule has three phenyl groups placed at each corner of an equilateral triangle. Then, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane. So that would give C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, but the molecule itself is planar, then it would have a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. So that would make it C3h.

But without seeing the structures, it's a bit tough. But considering the options, which one is more likely to have C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate (option C) seems like a solid candidate because of its trigonal planar structure.

Wait, but wait. Quinuclidine (option D) is a bicyclic structure. I think it has a bridge, making the molecule non-planar, so symmetry might be lower. For example, norbornane has a point group of C2h, but I'm not certain.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is likely option C. So among the options, C is triisopropyl borate, which has trigonal planar symmetry with D3h, which includes C3h. So the answer should be C.

To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**, we analyze the options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **Câ‚ƒh symmetry** consists of a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically at 120Â° intervals, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ). However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (h) is uncertain without a detailed structural analysis. While symmetry is possible, there is insufficient evidence to confirm **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule involves a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. Benzo rings typically have **Dâ‚™h symmetry**, but the fusion with the trifuran system likely disrupts the required **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**. The arrangement of substituents does not clearly support a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane, making this option unlikely.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. This arrangement provides a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (h) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis, as it is planar. Thus, triisopropyl borate exhibits **Dâ‚ƒh symmetry**, which includes **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**, making this option correct.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. Its symmetry is likely lower than **Câ‚ƒh**, as the bridge disrupts the possibility of a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. This option does not exhibit **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule with **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**, as it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. 

Answer: C
