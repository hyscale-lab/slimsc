Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz.

Hmm, right. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So I can't directly say that Pz has a definite value. Instead, I'll have to compute the expectation values using the given state.

First, let me write down the given matrices for Px, Py, and Pz. Wait, but looking back, the matrices for Px and Py are given, but for this problem, since we're dealing with Pz, I'll focus on its matrix. Pz's matrix is diagonal: first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So Pz is diagonal, which might make calculations easier.

The state vector is given as a column vector: ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [a; b; c], where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

First, I need to calculate ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value of Pz. Since Pz is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities (the squares of the amplitudes).

Wait, no. Wait, ⟨ψ|Pz|ψ⟩ is the expectation value. Since Pz is diagonal, the matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0
  0   0    0
  0   0  -ħ ]

So when I compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩, I can do it as:

a* * (ħ a) + b* * (0 * b) + c* * (-ħ c)

Because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So this simplifies to ħ |a|^2 - ħ |c|^2.

Let me compute |a|^2 and |c|^2. a is -1/2, so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2=1/4. Similarly, c is -1/2, so |c|^2 is also 1/4. So plugging in:

⟨Pz⟩ = ħ*(1/4) - ħ*(1/4) = 0.

Oh, interesting, the expectation value of Pz is zero. That might simplify things a bit.

Next, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz² is just the square of the matrix Pz. Let's compute Pz². Since Pz is diagonal, its square is just each diagonal element squared.

Pz² matrix:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0
  0, 0, 0
  0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] = [ ħ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ² ]

Wait, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So Pz² is a diagonal matrix with ħ², 0, ħ².

So when I compute ⟨Pz²⟩, it's similar to ⟨Pz⟩. It's the sum of |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ² |a|^2 + ħ² |c|^2.

Again, |a|^2 and |c|^2 are both 1/4 each. So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ² (1/4 + 1/4) )= ħ² * (1/2) = ħ²/2.

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, ⟨Pz⟩² is zero. So ΔPz is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake?

The state vector is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Calculating |a|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Same for |c|²: 1/4.

So in ⟨Pz⟩, it's (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

In ⟨Pz²⟩, it's (ħ²)(1/4 +1/4) = ħ²/2. So yes, square root is ħ / sqrt(2). So option B seems correct.

Another way to think: since the state is a combination of the eigenstates. The first basis vector is for Pz = ħ, the third is for Pz = -ħ, and the second is for Pz=0.

Wait, but wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is a linear combination of these.

The given state has components a, b, c.

So |a|² is the probability that the system is in the eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue ħ. Similarly, |c|² is the probability for eigenvalue -ħ.

So the average Pz is (a² * ħ) + (c² * (-ħ)) ) = ħ ( a² - c² ). Since a² = c² = 1/4, this becomes ħ ( (1/4) - (1/4) ) = 0. So that's correct.

Then, the average of Pz squared is (a² + c²) * ħ². Because the middle term is zero. So (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So sqrt(1/2) ħ is the uncertainty. So yeah, option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \hbar |a|^2 - \hbar |c|^2,
\]
where $a = -1/2$ and $c = -1/2$. Since $|a|^2 = |c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$, we find:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - \hbar \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 |a|^2 + \hbar^2 |c|^2.
\]
Substituting $|a|^2 = |c|^2 = 1/4$, we get:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \hbar^2 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
