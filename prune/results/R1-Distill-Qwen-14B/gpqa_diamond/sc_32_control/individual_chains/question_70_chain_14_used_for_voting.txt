Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. For example, something with a high degree of symmetry might have a D4h group, which is common for molecules like octahedral or square planar structures.

First, I'll try to break down the reactions given.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8 for A and B. What solid reacts with a gas in such a way? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, for example, if A is sulfur (S8), and B is something like oxygen (O2). But let me think about the products. The product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of things like Iodine (which is purple), but wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a sulfur oxide. Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a colorless gas, but maybe another compound.

Wait, another thought. If A is sodium sulfide (Na2S) and B is chlorine (Cl2), but that seems less likely because the product would probably be something else. Alternatively, maybe A is iron and B is sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C reacts with D (another gas) in a 2:1 ratio? Wait no, the second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So when C reacts with 2 eq of D, produces E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Also, looking at the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. One strong (like H2SO4) and one weak (like CH3COOH or something similar).

Wait, if C is SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like ammonium sulfate, but that doesn't fit the red color.

Another approach: let's think about the possible compounds. If C reacts with water to form two acids, one strong and one weak, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitrate or sulfate salt. Alternatively, if the reaction is something like the production of sulfur trioxide, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid? Wait, but H2SO4 itself is a strong acid. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions. Let's see:

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So, the formula would be something like A B8? Or perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen, but 8 equivalents seem high.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an element that forms a compound with B in an 8:1 ratio. Wait, sulfur is a solid at room temperature. Sulfur can react with oxygen to form SO2 or SO3. Let's say A is S8 and B is O2. Then, the reaction would be S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO3? No, wait, the reaction would form SO2, but maybe under certain conditions SO3.

Wait, actually, when S8 reacts with O2, the product is usually SO2: S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. But wait, SO2 is a gas, not a bright red solid. Hmm, perhaps C is another compound.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D. Let's think about what D could be. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D react in 1:1 to make H. Solvents could be things like water, ethanol, etc. But H is formed from B and D. If B is O2, then D might be something else, but O2 is a diatomic gas.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2, D is H2O? No, because Cl2 + H2O → HClO + HCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. But HClO is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. Wait, but H is a solvent. Maybe H is HClO, but HClO isn't a common solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but the product could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a noble gas? No, probably not. Alternatively, another thought: what if B is O2 and D is NH3? But that doesn't seem like a common reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. So O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So, a 1:2 ratio, but the problem states a 1:1 ratio for B and D. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: B is O2, D is H2O. O2 + 2 H2O → something? Not sure, but perhaps O2 and H2O in a reaction? That's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something like F2. O2 and F2 can react in a 1:1 ratio to form OF2? Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is NaOH (but NaOH is a solid, not a gas). So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps H is a solvent like ethanol. Then, what gases B and D would react in a 1:1 ratio to form ethanol? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a solvent like acetone. So, what reaction would produce acetone? Maybe from a ketone, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else that reacts to form H.

Alternatively, maybe H is H2O, which is a solvent. Then, what if B is O2 and D is H2? O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps B is another gas. Maybe B is N2 and D is H2. Then, under certain conditions, they react to form NH3, which is a solvent? But that's a 1:3 ratio for N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's not 1:1.

Hmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let's think about the overall problem again.

The key is to find E's molecular symmetry. So perhaps knowing what E is could help. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. Also, E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like sarin gas, but perhaps that's too far.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So maybe C is a salt, like a sulfonate or something else.

Wait, let's think about the hydrolysis of a sulfonate. Suppose C is something like CH3SO3H, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong) and CH3COOH (weak), but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like ammonium sulfate, but that wouldn't produce two different acids.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, if A is HNO3, but wait, A is a solid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When KClO3 is heated, it can decompose into KCl and O2, but that's not about reacting with water.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. Reacting with water would not produce two acids, though.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. If A is S8 and C is S(OH)4 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first reaction again. Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → C. 8 equivalents suggest a molar ratio of 1:8. So, for every mole of A, 8 moles of B are consumed.

If A is S8, which is a solid, and B is O2, the reaction would be S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO3. Wait, but let's check the stoichiometry. S8 has 8 S atoms. If it reacts with O2 to form SO3, each S atom would combine with 3 O atoms. So 8 S would require 24 O atoms, which is 12 O2 molecules. So the reaction would be S8 + 12 O2 → 8 SO3. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, which is O2, which would be 8 moles. So that would only give (8 O2) × 2 O atoms per molecule = 16 O atoms. 8 S atoms would each need 3 O, so 24 O needed. But 8 O2 only provides 16 O, which isn't enough. So that's a problem. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe B isn't O2 but something else. Let me think of another solid reacting with a gas in an 8:1 ratio.

Wait, another possibility: A is Fe, and B is Cl2. The reaction Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is HCl. Not sure.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal, like phosphorus. Reacting with Cl2: P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3. But that's 6 equivalents of Cl2 for 1 P4. So that's 6 equivalents, not 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a diatomic solid. For example, maybe A is O2, but that's a gas, not solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product E. It's produced when C reacts with 2 eq of D. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous gases? Maybe something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's think about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. What are common solvents that can be formed from a 1:1 reaction of two gases? For example, H2O is a solvent. If B is H2 and D is O2, their reaction would form H2O with a 2:1 ratio (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O), but that's not 1:1. So perhaps another combination.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. For example, CO2 and H2O could form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's not a typical solvent. Alternatively, CO2 and NH3 could form NH4HCO3, but that's a solid, not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form 2 HCl and S. But HCl is a gas, and S is a solid. So H is S, which isn't a solvent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this. Let me try another angle. The third reaction: C reacts with water to form A and two acids. So, for example, if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3, reacting with water would produce NaOH (but that's not two acids). Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Na3N, hydrolysis gives NH3 and NaOH. Again, not two acids.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, hydrolysis gives CO2 and water, but that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is something like ammonium sulfide, (NH4)2S. Reacting with water would produce NH3 and H2S, which are both bases, not acids. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO4H (methanesulfonic acid), but that's a strong acid itself. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. But I'm not getting anywhere with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis of C produces a strong and weak acid. For instance, maybe C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into HNO3 (strong acid) and something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3H. Then, hydrolysis would yield H2SO4 (strong acid) and RCOOH (if R is an alkyl group, then RCOOH would be a weak acid). That might fit.

So, for example, if C is CH3SO3H (methanesulfonic acid), which upon hydrolysis would break down into H2SO4 and CH3COOH? Wait, I'm not sure if that's the case. Methanesulfonic acid is a strong acid itself; perhaps it doesn't hydrolyze further.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let's say C is a sulfonic acid ester, like RSO3OR'. But when it hydrolyzes, maybe it produces H2SO4 and R'OH, but that's an alcohol, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite ester. For example, if C is something like (RO)2SO3H. Hydrolysis might produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and RCOOH. But I'm not certain about the exact products.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If C is a sulfite (SO3^2-), then perhaps A is a metal that forms a sulfite. For example, if A is Na2S, reacting with O would form Na2SO3. But the stoichiometry might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is sulfur. For example, A could be Fe, B is S8. Then, Fe + S → FeS. But the stoichiometry would be 1:1, and the product would be FeS, which is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a metal oxide? For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is O2. 4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O. But that's a 4:1 ratio, not 8:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something like carbon. Reacting carbon with O2 could form CO or CO2. But again, not sure about the product color.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of substances like mercury(II) oxide (HgO), which is red, but that's a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide. Another possibility is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the bright red product could be iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3·nH2O (hematite), which is reddish. So if A is Fe and B is O2, then the reaction would be Fe + O2 → Fe2O3. But the stoichiometry? Let's see: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So that's a 4:3 ratio, which doesn't match the 8 equivalents needed. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different oxidizing agent. Another thought: perhaps B is Cl2. A solid reacting with Cl2 in a 8:1 ratio. For example, if A is Fe, then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The stoichiometry would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's 3/2 equivalents, not 8. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on identifying A, B, C, D, etc. Maybe I should think about the possible products and then work backward.

E is produced when C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio. E is extremely hazardous. Let me think of some hazardous substances. For instance, phosgene (COCl2) is a toxic gas. How is it formed? From the dehydration of carbon tetrachloride with a strong acid, but that's not involving a reaction with another gas. Alternatively, maybe from the reaction of OCl2 with something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if E is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Alternatively, maybe E is HCN, which is highly toxic. HCN is formed from the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids. So if D is a strong acid and C is a cyanide salt, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is toxic but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or, maybe E is NO2, which is a toxic gas. How is NO2 formed? From the reaction of nitric acid with something else, but again, not sure.

Wait, considering that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O. So, for example, if B is H2 and D is O2, but their reaction ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, what if B is CO2 and D is something else? For instance, CO2 + 2 H2O → 2 H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's not a solvent. Alternatively, CO2 + NH3 → NH4CO3, which is a solid, not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. So that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking for a solvent that is formed from the reaction of two gases in a 1:1 ratio. For example, HCl and NH3 can react to form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Alternatively, perhaps H2O is the solvent, but I can't see how to get it from a 1:1 reaction of two gases unless it's from something like O2 and H2, but that's 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 1:2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms something else. Wait, maybe B is SO2 and D is a base. For instance, SO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO3 + H2O. But again, that doesn't form a solvent in a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about E and its symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Symmetry groups are determined by the shape of the molecule. For example, D4h is the symmetry group of a square planar molecule like [Ni(CN)4]^2- or something with fourfold symmetry. C2v has a mirror plane and a two-fold rotation axis, which is common for molecules like H2O or NH3.

If E is a molecule with a certain shape, I can match it to the symmetry group. For example, if E is linear (like CO2), its symmetry group is D∞h. If it's trigonal planar, maybe C2v. Or if it's tetrahedral, Td, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So D4h implies a four-fold symmetry, perhaps a square planar or octahedral structure. D∞h is for linear molecules. C2v is for molecules with a two-fold axis and two mirror planes, like water.

So, perhaps E is a linear molecule, giving it D∞h symmetry. Which toxic gas is linear? CO, NO, HCN, etc. For example, HCN is a linear molecule, so it would have D∞h symmetry.

If E is HCN, then how is it formed? HCN is formed when cyanide salts react with strong acids. But in our scenario, C reacts with D to form E. So C would have to be a cyanide salt, and D a strong acid.

Wait, but in the third reaction, C reacts with water to form A and two acids F and G. So, if C is NaCN, reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids. Wait, NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. NaOH is a strong base, HCN is a weak acid. So that would give one strong base and one weak acid. But in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe C is a different compound.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfonate ester, like CH3SO3H. When it reacts with water, perhaps it decomposes into H2SO4 (strong acid) and CH3COOH (weak acid). But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Al(NO3)3. Reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrate salt like Ca(NO3)2 is heated, it can decompose into Ca(NO2)2 and O2. But that's not relevant to reacting with water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO4H, then hydrolysis would give H2SO4 (strong) and CH3COOH (weak). That fits the description. So C would be CH3SO4H (methanesulfonic acid). Then, when it reacts with water, it produces H2SO4 (F) and CH3COOH (G). So that makes sense.

So, C is CH3SO4H. Now, what is A? Because when C reacts with water, it produces A. So A must be CH3COOH, but wait, that's G. Hmm, no. Wait, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So, if C is CH3SO4H, then the hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (F), CH3COOH (G), and what is A?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think: CH3SO4H is a strong acid, when it reacts with water, perhaps it undergoes some kind of decomposition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. If A is CH3COOH (acetic acid), and B is O2, reacting in an 8:1 ratio. But CH3COOH is a liquid, not a solid. So, perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A is CH3COONa (sodium acetate), which is a solid. Then, reacting with O2 in an 8:1 ratio... but I'm not sure what product that would form.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a sulfonic acid. For example, if A is CH3COOH and B is H2SO4, but that's unlikely.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about E's structure. If E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be D∞h (option C). Another possibility is CO, which is also linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule, but the options don't include Td.

Wait, another thought: if E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxyfuran?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar with a trigonal structure. Its symmetry group is D∞h? No, wait, D∞h is for linear structures. Wait, phosgene's structure is trigonal planar, which would have a different symmetry group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like SO2, which is bent, with a symmetry group of D∞h. Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule, so its symmetry group is D∞h? Wait, actually, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2 axis and a mirror plane, so its point group is D∞h. Yes, because it's a bent molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. So SO2 would have D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is SO2, which is a toxic gas, then its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

Now, how would E be formed? SO2 is produced when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen. So, perhaps C is SO3, which reacts with D (which is something else) to form SO2.

Wait, but earlier in the problem, when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids F and G. If C is SO3, then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid, F) and what else? Wait, that's only one product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Alternatively, if C is something else. Wait, perhaps C is S(OH)4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate ester. Let me try to fit this together.

If E is SO2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let's see. If C is SO3, and D is H2O, then C + D → SO2 and something else. Wait, but that's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is H2SO4, but that doesn't fit with the reaction with water producing two acids.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but from the symmetry group options, if E is SO2, then the symmetry group is D∞h (option C). Another possibility is HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

So, putting it all together, if E is HCN or SO2, the symmetry group would be D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. The analysis proceeds by breaking down the reactions and identifying possible compounds for A, B, C, D, and E.

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a 1:8 ratio, and the bright red color hints at compounds like SO3 or possibly a sulfonic acid derivative. However, SO3 is a gas, not a solid, so the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, an extremely hazardous product. The options for E include highly toxic gases like HCN, SO2, or phosgene. These gases are analyzed for their molecular symmetry groups:
   - **HCN** is a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.
   - **SO2** is a bent molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.
   - **Phosgene (COCl2)** is a trigonal planar molecule, but its symmetry group is not among the options.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C could be a sulfonate ester, such as CH3SO3H, which upon hydrolysis produces H2SO4 (strong acid) and CH3COOH (weak acid). However, the exact identity of A remains unclear.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents like H2O or CH3OH are considered, but the exact nature of B and D remains uncertain.

Given the symmetry group options (C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v), the analysis focuses on E. If E is HCN or SO2, both are linear or bent molecules with **D∞h** symmetry. This matches the description of E as extremely hazardous and aligns with the molecular symmetry group **D∞h**.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:
- **A (C2)**: This symmetry group corresponds to molecules with a single two-fold rotation axis, such as water (H2O). However, E is described as a linear or bent molecule, not a simple two-fold axis.
- **B (D4h)**: This group corresponds to square planar or octahedral molecules, which do not match the linear or bent nature of E.
- **C (D∞h)**: This group corresponds to linear or bent molecules, such as HCN or SO2, which align with the description of E as extremely hazardous.
- **D (C2v)**: This group corresponds to molecules like NH3, which have a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. This does not match the linear or bent nature of E.

Based on the analysis, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, as it matches the molecular structure of HCN or SO2, both of which are consistent with the description of E as extremely hazardous.

**Answer: C**
