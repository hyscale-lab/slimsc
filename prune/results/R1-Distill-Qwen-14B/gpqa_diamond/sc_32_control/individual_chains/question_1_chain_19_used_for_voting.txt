Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question. Let's see what the question is about. The problem says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role in the energy levels and their lifetimes. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the lifetime (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ (hbar), or maybe something like h/(2π), I'm not exactly sure of the constants here.

Wait, the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. But for an order of magnitude calculation, maybe we can approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The energy-time uncertainty principle is given by ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, where Δt is the characteristic time, which here is the lifetime of the state. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to its lifetime.

So for the first state, E1, the lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. Then ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me denote ΔE = E2 - E1. But for them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each uncertainty needs to be smaller than the energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the uncertainty for each energy level. Because each state has its own uncertainty.

So, for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2).

But the energy difference between the two states should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, so that the two states are well-separated and can be distinguished.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. When you have two energy levels, their lifetimes determine the uncertainty in their respective energies. So if the energy difference between them is much larger than the uncertainties, they can be resolved.

So the minimum condition for resolution is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but perhaps it's more about the uncertainty in each state. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty, so the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties so that they don't overlap.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think step by step.

The energy-time uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i ≈ ħ / (2Δt_i). So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1). Similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

Wait, but perhaps the energy difference between the two states should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Alternatively, since each state has an uncertainty, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. No, that doesn't sound right. Because if the energy difference is just a bit larger than the smaller uncertainty, but the other state's uncertainty is much larger, perhaps that's not enough.

Wait, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is about ħ/τ, so the energy difference needs to be at least on the order of ħ/ τ_min, where τ_min is the shorter lifetime.

Wait, in our case, τ1 is 1e-9 s and τ2 is 1e-8 s. So τ1 is shorter. So ΔE must be at least about ħ/(1e-9 s). Let me compute that.

But wait, maybe it's better to compute the uncertainty in each energy and see what the energy difference needs to be.

So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Let me compute ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1.

So τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1.05e-25 J.

Hmm, that's in joules. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are approximately 6.56e-7 eV and 6.56e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but wait a second. There's a factor of 2 in the uncertainty principle. I think the actual expression is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so perhaps I should use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 τ). So let me correct that.

So τ1 is 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) → 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) → 5.25e-26 J → 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-8) → 5.25e-27 J → 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 3.28e-7 eV and 3.28e-8 eV, respectively.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is much larger than the sum, then the two levels are well-separated.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is E2 - E1. So let's say the two energy levels are adjacent, but their uncertainties are such that without a sufficient ΔE, they might overlap.

So the condition would be ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute that: 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.608e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be at least around 3.6e-7 eV or higher.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 3.6e-7. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is still smaller than 3.6e-7. So the energy difference would be 0.1 times the required minimum. So not enough.

Wait, wait, because 3.6e-7 eV is about 3.6e-7 eV. So the only option that's larger than this is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, that's a lot larger than the required 3.6e-7. So option C would be sufficient.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Are the uncertainties additive? Or do we only need the energy difference to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Wait, let me think again. Each state has its own energy uncertainty. So the energies are not exact, but have a spread. So for E1, it's around E1 ± ΔE1. For E2, E2 ± ΔE2.

To distinguish them, the lower end of E2 must be higher than the upper end of E1. So E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1.

Which implies E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Yes, so the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. So my initial calculation is correct.

So the minimum required ΔE is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, so from the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, much larger than 3.6e-7.

Wait, but 1e-4 eV is 100,000 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is sufficient.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my initial calculation of ħ/(2 τ). Let me recompute that.

So ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = (1.05/2) * 1e-25 = 0.525e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 0.525e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.277e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / (2 *1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 0.525e-26 J.

Converted to eV: 0.525e-26 / 1.602e-19 = 3.277e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.277e-7 + 3.277e-8 = 3.6047e-7 eV.

So the required ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.000001 eV → too small.

B) 1e-11 → 0.0000000001 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV compared to the required 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is 277 times larger than 3.6e-7 (since 3.6e-7 * 277 ≈ 1e-4).

So yes, 1e-4 eV is definitely larger than 3.6e-7, so it would work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8 eV. 3.6e-7 eV is 36 times larger than that. So option D is insufficient.

So the correct answer is option C: 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the \( i \)-th state. The energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states to ensure they can be clearly resolved:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties
The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The lifetimes are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).

For \( \tau_1 \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( \tau_2 \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
The energy difference must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} = 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00001 \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
