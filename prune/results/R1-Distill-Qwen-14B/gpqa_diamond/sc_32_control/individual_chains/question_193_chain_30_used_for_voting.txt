Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So the given relation is number of stars N = 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give N = 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N = r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So they probably want the derivative of N with respect to r. Because that's the rate of change per unit distance.

So N = r^5. So the derivative dN/dr is 5 r^4. That means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance, but the rate at which they increase (per unit distance) is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait a second, let me make sure I got the relation right. The problem says the number varies with 1/plx^5. So plx is inversely proportional to r, so plx = 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about dN/dr, which is 5r^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4. So yes, option C.

The problem states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Starting with \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
