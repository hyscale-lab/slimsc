Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is lithium-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light (0.96c), I should probably use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc². But wait, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it? Oh wait, sometimes collider energy is given as the total energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, RHIC colliders typically accelerate ions to high speeds, and the energy they refer to is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy including rest mass? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC, so I think it's the total energy. Or maybe the kinetic energy. Hmm, I should clarify.

Wait, the formula for kinetic energy in relativity is (γ-1)mc². So if the question is asking for the energy, I need to know whether it's total energy or kinetic. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC". I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle (or per ion in this case). But sometimes, especially in older contexts, it might refer to the total energy. Hmm, this part is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states it more clearly. Let me read the question again. Oh, it says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps the energy here is the total energy of the nucleus. Or maybe the kinetic.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the approach.

First, I'll calculate the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, substitute that in.

So v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784):

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is needed. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... Hmm, I need to get the mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. But each mole has Avogadro's number (6.022e23) atoms. The molar mass is about 6.941 grams per mole. So the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is m = (6.941 g/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) * (1e-3 kg/g) ) = let me compute that.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the mass in kilograms more directly. Alternatively, I can think in terms of atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 1.6605e-27 kg. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 u.

Wait, more accurately, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0105 atomic mass units. Because the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but for the isotope Li-6, the mass is about 6.0105 u. Let's confirm that.

Wait, actually, I think the exact mass number is for each isotope. For Li-6, the mass is about 6.0105 u. Let me proceed with that.

So m = 6.0105 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ ?

Calculating that: 6.0105 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 6 * 1.66e-27 = 9.96e-27 kg, but let me compute it accurately.

6.0105 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 1.6605 = 9.963. 0.0105 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.017435. So total is 9.963 + 0.017435 ≈ 9.980435e-27 kg.

So m = 9.980435e-27 kg.

Now, the rest mass energy is mc². c is about 3e8 m/s.

So mc² = 9.980435e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So 9.980435e-27 * 9e16 = ?

Let's compute 9.980435e-27 * 9e16 = (9.980435 * 9) )e (-27+16) = 89.823915e-11 = 8.9823915e-10 J.

Wait, but that's in joules. To convert that to GeV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

So, 8.9823915e-10 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) = (8.9823915e-10) / (1.602e-19) ) eV.

Compute that: 8.982e-10 / 1.602e-19 = (8.982 / 1.602) * 1e9 = approximately 5.605 * 1e9 eV = 5.605 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that division: 8.982 / 1.602 ≈ 5.605.

So, the rest mass energy is about 5.605 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 6 u is about 6 * 1.66e-27 kg, which is about 1e-26 kg. Then mc² would be about 1e-26 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) = 9e-10 J, which is 9e-10 / 1.6e-19 = 5e9 eV, which is 5 GeV. But wait, I'm a bit off, perhaps the exact value is about 5.6 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation of m. Let me try again.

Wait, 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg exactly. So Li-6 is 6.010502 u.

So m = 6.010502 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

6.010502 * 1.66053906660e-27.

Compute 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.010502 * 1.66053906660e-27 = approx 0.010502 * 1.6605e-27 = 1.7415e-29 kg.

Adding together: 9.9632343996e-27 + 1.7415e-29 = 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.017415e-27 = 9.9806493996e-27 kg.

So m = 9.9806494e-27 kg.

Then mc² = 9.9806494e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

3e8 squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So mc² = 9.9806494e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s².

Multiply 9.9806494e-27 *9e16 = (9.9806494 * 9) * 1e(-27 +16) = 89.8258446 * 1e-11 = 8.98258446e-10 J.

Now, converting J to eV:

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So 8.98258446e-10 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (8.98258446 / 1.602176634) * 1e9 eV.

Compute 8.98258446 / 1.602176634 ≈ 5.605 GeV.

Wait, I think I remember that the rest mass energy of a carbon-12 nucleus is around 12 GeV or so, so Li-6 should be about half of that, around 5.6 GeV. So that seems correct.

So the rest mass energy is about 5.605 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times mc^2. So E = gamma * 5.605 GeV.

Gamma was earlier calculated as approximately 3.5714.

So E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.605 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.605 = let's see: 3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284; 3.5714 * 0.005=0.017857; sum is 2.14284 + 0.017857 = 2.160697.

So total is 17.857 + 2.160697 ≈ 20.0177 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0177 GeV. But let me compute it more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.605 = ?

Let me multiply 3.57142857 by 5.605.

3.57142857 times 5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 times 0.605:

0.605 is 605/1000 = 121/200.

So 3.57142857 * 121/200 = ?

3.57142857 * 121 = let's compute that.

3 * 121 = 363.

0.57142857 * 121 = approx 0.57142857 * 120 = 68.5714284, plus 0.57142857 *1 = 0.57142857 → total 69.14285697.

So total 363 + 69.14285697 = 432.14285697.

Now, divide by 200: 432.14285697 / 200 = 2.160714285 GeV.

So total E = 17.85714285 + 2.160714285 ≈ 20.017857 GeV.

So E ≈ 20.0179 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 18.475

B) 23.069

C) 20.132

D) 21.419

So my calculation gives about 20.0179 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132), but perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Exactly, it's 25/7, because 25 ÷7 is 3.571428....

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/0.28 is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So E = gamma * mc² = (25/7) * 5.605 GeV.

Wait, 5.605 multiplied by 25 is 140.125, then divided by 7.

140.125 ÷7 = 20.017857 GeV.

So E ≈20.017857 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but it's a bit higher. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.010502 u. Let me compute that more accurately.

So m = 6.010502 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

Compute this:

6.010502 * 1.66053906660e-27.

Let me compute each part.

First, 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

Then, 0.010502 *1.66053906660e-27: Let's compute 0.01 is 1.66053906660e-29, and 0.000502 * 1.66053906660e-27.

Wait, 0.010502 = 0.01 + 0.000502.

So 0.01 *1.66053906660e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.000502 *1.6605390666e-27 = (5.02e-4) *1.6605390666e-27 = 5.02 *1.6605390666e-31 = approx 8.33e-31 kg.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.010502 *1.6605390666e-27.

Wait, 0.010502 is 1.0502e-2.

So 1.0502e-2 *1.6605390666e-27 = (1.0502 *1.6605390666) )e-29.

1.0502 *1.6605390666 ≈ 1.0502 *1.66054 ≈ 1.7555.

So 1.7555e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.9632343996e-27 kg +1.7555e-29 kg = 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.017555e-27 =9.9807893996e-27 kg.

So m = 9.9807894e-27 kg.

Now, mc² = 9.9807894e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s²= 8.98271046e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 8.98271046e-10 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (8.98271046 /1.602176634 ) * 1e9 eV.

Compute 8.98271046 /1.602176634.

Let me do this division accurately.

1.602176634 *5 =8.01088317.

8.98271046 -8.01088317 =0.97182729.

So 5 times 1.602176634 is 8.01088317, leaving 0.97182729.

0.97182729 /1.602176634 ≈ 0.6067.

So total is 5.6067.

So rest mass energy is 5.6067 GeV.

So E = gamma * rest energy = (25/7) * 5.6067.

Compute 5.6067 *25 = 140.1675.

Divide by 7: 140.1675 /7 = 20.0239286 GeV.

Hmm, so E ≈20.0239 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher than 20.02 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then the calculation would be (gamma -1) * mc².

So let me compute that.

Gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857, so gamma -1 =2.57142857.

So KE = (gamma -1) * 5.6067 GeV.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.6067.

Let me compute that.

2 *5.6067 =11.2134.

0.57142857 *5.6067 = ?

0.5 *5.6067 =2.80335.

0.07142857 *5.6067 ≈0.4026.

So sum is 2.80335 +0.4026 =3.20595.

So total KE = 11.2134 +3.20595 =14.41935 GeV.

That's about 14.419 GeV, which isn't one of the options. So I think the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the total energy is approximately 20.02 GeV. The options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass or something else.

Let me check the exact value of Li-6's mass. From exact data, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.010502 u. Let me verify that.

Yes, the exact mass is about 6.010502 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for mc². Let me compute mc² again.

m = 6.010502 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u = exact?

Yes, as done earlier.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the gamma factor.

Wait, v =0.96c.

So beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that would be around 14.4 GeV, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is being considered as the sum of the individual nucleons, but that would complicate things. Let me think. No, because the nucleus is a composite particle; its mass is just the given mass, so I think that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rest mass energy more accurately.

Let me compute mc² again.

m = 6.010502 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u = 6.010502 *1.66053906660e-27.

Compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.010502 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute 0.01 *1.66053906660e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.000502 *1.6605390666e-27 = 0.000502 *1.6605390666e-27 =5.02e-4 *1.6605390666e-27 = 8.346e-31 kg.

So total m =9.9632343996e-27 +1.6605390666e-29 +8.346e-31.

Wait, 1.6605390666e-29 is 0.016605390666e-27, and 8.346e-31 is 0.0008346e-27.

So sum: 9.9632343996e-27 + 0.016605390666e-27 +0.0008346e-27 = 9.9632343996 +0.016605390666 +0.0008346 = 9.98067439026e-27 kg.

So m =9.98067439026e-27 kg.

Then mc² =9.98067439026e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So 9.98067439026e-27 *9e16 = 8.982606951234e-10 J.

Convert J to eV: 8.982606951234e-10 /1.602176634e-19 = (8.982606951234 /1.602176634) *1e9 eV.

Compute 8.982606951234 /1.602176634 ≈5.6067 GeV.

So mc² =5.6067 GeV.

E = gamma * mc² = (25/7) *5.6067 =20.0239 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0239 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is somewhat larger. But perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the exact rest mass of Li-6 is more accurately 6.010502 u, but maybe I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the gamma more accurately.

Wait, gamma = 25/7 =3.5714285714.

Wait, let me compute 25/7 *5.6067 GeV.

25 *5.6067 =140.1675.

Divided by 7: 140.1675 /7 = 20.02392857 GeV.

So about 20.0239 GeV.

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, correct. But perhaps more accurately, c is approximately 299792458 m/s. Using this more precise value might change the calculation slightly.

Let me try that.

Compute v =0.96c =0.96 *299792458 m/s =287,875,  0.96 *299792458 = let me compute 299792458 *0.96.

Wait, 299792458 *0.96 =?

299792458 *0.96 = (300,000,000 *0.96) - (207542 *0.96).

Wait, 300,000,000 *0.96 =288,000,000.

207,542 *0.96 = approx 200,000 *0.96 =192,000, so 207,542 *0.96≈199,  200*0.96=192, so 207,542 *0.96=199, 200*0.96=192, so 207,542 *0.96=199, 200*0.96=192, so 207,542*0.96= (200,000 *0.96) + (7,542 *0.96) = 192,000 + 7,236.  So 199,236.

So 299,792,458 *0.96≈288,000,000 -199,236 =287,800,764 m/s.

Hmm, but perhaps it's not necessary to use such a precise value for v, as the earlier calculation used v=0.96c as 0.96 times the speed of light, so the gamma calculation was correct.

Wait, but perhaps using a more precise value for c would adjust the gamma slightly. Let me try that.

Compute beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps the exact calculation is better.

Wait, 1 - beta^2 =1 - (0.96)^2 =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 3.57142857 exactly.

So that part is accurate.

Hmm, perhaps the answer expects the kinetic energy, but that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the entire nucleus, but individual nucleons. No, the problem states nucleus X, so it's the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the way energy is computed. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which might be the kinetic energy per nucleon. But no, the RHIC accelerates entire nuclei, so the energy per nucleus is what's relevant.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula, E = gamma * m_rest * c^2, but all values are in appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps I can compute gamma * m_rest * c^2 in units of GeV directly, without converting to kg and m/s.

Because m_rest in GeV/c². Because E (GeV) = m_rest (GeV/c²) * c^2.

So,

m_rest =6.010502 u * (1 GeV / (1.6605390666e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 m²/s² )).

Wait, but another approach is to compute m_rest in GeV/c².

1 GeV/c² = (1.602176634e-10 J) / ( (3e8 m/s)^2 ) ) = (1.602176634e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s² ) = 1.78019626e-27 kg.

So 1 GeV/c² =1.78019626e-27 kg.

So m_rest (GeV/c²) = m_rest (kg) / (1.78019626e-27 kg/GeV/c²).

So for m_rest =6.010502 u *1.6605390666e-27 kg/u.

m_rest =6.010502 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.98067439e-27 kg.

So m_rest (GeV/c²) = 9.98067439e-27 kg / 1.78019626e-27 kg/GeV/c² = 5.6067 GeV/c².

So E = gamma * m_rest * c² = gamma *5.6067 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 * 5.6067 GeV =20.0239 GeV.

So, that's about 20.0239 GeV.

Looking again at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 20.0239 is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m_rest. Wait, let me ensure that the mass is correct. Let me recheck the calculation of m_rest in GeV/c².

m_rest =6.010502 u * (1 GeV/c² per 1.6605390666e-27 kg) / (1 u) * (1.6605390666e-27 kg/u) =

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute directly.

Wait, 1 GeV/c² =1.7827e-27 kg (exactly, 1.602176634e-10 J / 9e16 m²/s² =1.78019626e-27 kg).

Wait, 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So, 1 u = (1.66053906660e-27 kg) / (1.78019626e-27 kg/GeV/c²) ) GeV/c².

So 1 u =1.66053906660e-27 / 1.78019626e-27 ≈0.933 GeV/c².

So 6.010502 u *0.933 GeV/c²/u ≈6.010502 *0.933 ≈5.606 GeV/c².

So m_rest ≈5.606 GeV/c².

So E =gamma *5.606 GeV.

gamma =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.606 GeV =?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.606.

3 *5.606 =16.818.

0.57142857 *5.606 ≈3.199.

So sum is 16.818 +3.199=20.017 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20.017 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation is 20.0239 GeV, which is about 20.024 GeV.

But the options don't have this, so maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.010502 u. Let me check again.

Another thought: perhaps the error comes from using the exact value of c. Let me compute gamma with more precise v.

Wait, v =0.96c, so beta is exactly 0.96. So gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise computation in the calculation.

So,

gamma =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So,

E =gamma * m_rest * c² =3.5714285714 *5.6067 GeV =?

3.5714285714 *5.6067 =?

Let's compute 5.6067 *3 =16.8201.

5.6067 *0.5714285714.

Compute 5.6067 *0.5 =2.80335.

5.6067 *0.0714285714 ≈0.4025.

So sum is 2.80335 +0.4025 =3.20585.

So total E =16.8201 +3.20585 =20.02595 GeV.

Approximately 20.026 GeV.

Hmm, again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the given options are in total energy, but the calculation is correct, but the options are off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the energy to be in the center-of-mass frame, but no, the question states the speed is 0.96c, which is in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.010502 u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the value of c used. Let me compute c as exactly 299792458 m/s.

Wait, perhaps using c^2 as (299792458)^2 would make a slight difference, but I think it's negligible for four decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using more precise values.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects the energy per nucleon, but that's not what the question is asking. The question is about the nucleus.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, the problem gives the precision as 1e-4, so probably one of the options is the correct. My calculation is 20.0239 GeV, which is approximately 20.024 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is about 0.1 GeV higher. Perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the atomic mass, including electrons. No, because for a nucleus, the electrons are not part of the mass when considering the nucleus as a whole. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the deuteron or something else, but no, the question says it's Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a Li-6 nucleus as 6.941 g/mol, but that's the atomic weight, which is higher than the actual mass of the nucleus.

Wait, no, the atomic mass includes electrons. So the actual nuclear mass would be lower. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as having a mass number A=6, but the actual mass is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula E = gamma * m_p * A, where m_p is the proton mass. But that would be incorrect, as the nucleus mass isn't simply A times the proton mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the proton mass (about 938 MeV) multiplied by the mass number (6), but that would give 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV, which is close to the rest mass we calculated. So that approach would give the same result.

So I think the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are using a different approach or have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing the error in my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use beta as 0.98c instead of 0.96c, but no, the question says 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of gamma again.

Wait, v=0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula for kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) * m c².

Then, KE = (3.57142857 -1)*5.6067 ≈2.57142857 *5.6067 ≈14.419 GeV.

But 14.419 isn't one of the options, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the exact value of gamma * m_rest_energy.

m_rest_energy =5.6067 GeV.

gamma =3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6067 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6067 = approx.

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0067= approx 0.02392857.

So sum is approx 2.14285714 +0.02392857 ≈2.16678571.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.16678571=20.02392856 GeV.

Which is 20.0239 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but it's about 0.1 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6 including binding energy. Wait, no, because the rest mass already accounts for that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula but neglecting the rest mass, which would be incorrect. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use natural units where c=1. Then, the energy would be gamma times the rest mass in GeV.

So, with c=1, E = gamma * m_rest.

So, m_rest is 5.6067 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6067 ≈20.0239 GeV.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.010502 u. So my calculation is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the average binding energy or something else.

Wait, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 20.024 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m_rest_energy.

Wait, m_rest_energy in GeV is 5.6067 GeV.

So, E =gamma *5.6067.

Gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6067.

Let me compute 3 *5.6067 =16.8201.

0.57142857 *5.6067 = ?

5.6067 * 0.5 =2.80335.

5.6067 *0.07142857 ≈0.4025.

So sum is 2.80335 +0.4025 =3.20585.

So total E=16.8201 +3.20585 =20.02595 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.026 GeV.

But none of the options match. Then perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus including electrons, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the intended speed was 0.98c, leading to a higher gamma.

Wait, let me see.

If beta were 0.98, then gamma would be 5, and E would be 5 *5.6067=28.0335 GeV, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99c.

Gamma would be 7.0888, and E would be ~39.5 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ion as a collection of protons and neutrons, each with their own rest mass.

But that's not correct because the nucleus has a binding energy, and the mass is less than the sum of individual nucleons.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of the rest masses, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single proton multiplied by the number of nucleons, but that would overcount.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the lightest nucleus, like hydrogen, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for kinetic energy, but as I calculated earlier, that's about 14.4 GeV.

But none of the options are close.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, but using a different mass value.

Wait, perhaps the problem used the mass of Li-6 as 6 *938 MeV (proton mass) =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV. So with gamma 3.57142857, E=3.57142857 *5.628 ≈20.09 GeV.

Still not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem used a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem used a different value for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem used gamma = (1/(1-v^2/c^2))^0.5 as approximate, but that's the same as what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the formula E = (m c²) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as gamma m c².

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the relativistic energy formula E = K + m c², but that's the same as what I did.

Hmm.

I'm starting to think that the correct energy is approximately 20.024 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, perhaps due to more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of gamma = 3.5714, but with more precise rest mass.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of m_rest * gamma.

m_rest =5.6067 GeV.

gamma =3.57142857.

So 5.6067 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.6067 *3 =16.8201.

5.6067 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.6067 *0.5=2.80335.

5.6067 *0.07142857 = approx 0.4025.

So sum is 2.80335 +0.4025=3.20585.

Total E=16.8201 +3.20585=20.02595 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.02595 GeV, which is approximately 20.026 GeV.

But options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6.941 GeV/c².

Wait, 6.941 GeV/c² would be the molar mass, which is incorrect because molar mass is grams per mole.

Wait, no, a molar mass of 6.941 g/mol means that each nucleus has a mass of 6.941 / (Avogadro's number) grams. Converting that to GeV/c² would be much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the nucleus as 6.941 u, which is the atomic mass of Li. But that's incorrect, as the nucleus is Li-6, which is 6.0105 u.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct energy should be approximately 20.024 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)21.419 GeV, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96²) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c, such as 3e8 m/s exactly, but that shouldn't change the gamma.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded to four decimal places, as per the PS note.

So 20.0239 GeV is 20.0239, which rounds to 20.0239 GeV. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C)20.132 GeV, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6.941 GeV/c², which would be incorrect, but let's see:

If m_rest =6.941 GeV/c².

Then E=3.57142857 *6.941 ≈24.737 GeV, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6.941 u, which is incorrect because Li-6 is 6.0105 u.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the average or something else.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.024 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. However, perhaps the intended answer is C)20.132 GeV due to a slight miscalculation on my part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me try calculating 6.010502 u in GeV/c² again.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

1 GeV/c² =1.7827e-27 kg.

So 6.010502 u =6.010502 *1.66053906660e-27 kg =9.98067e-27 kg.

Convert to GeV/c²: 9.98067e-27 kg /1.7827e-27 kg/GeV/c² =5.606 GeV/c².

So E=gamma *5.606 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.606 =20.024 GeV.

Hmm.

Well, I think the correct answer is approximately 20.024 GeV, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.010502 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \). Converting to kilograms:

\[
m = 6.010502 \times 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 9.98067 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

The rest mass energy in joules is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = (9.98067 \times 10^{-27}) \times (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 8.9826 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to GeV (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = \frac{8.9826 \times 10^{-10}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.606 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.606 \approx 20.024 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.024 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or slight variations in constants used.

Answer: C
