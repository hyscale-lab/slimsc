Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Let's try to break this down step by step. 

First, the question says that compound X (C11H12O) reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Oh wait, right, it's a common catalyst or base used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially under thermal conditions. So the product formed here is probably from an epoxide opening.

The resulting product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H and 13C NMR signals to figure out the structure.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet for 3H, maybe a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not near any protons, so perhaps attached to an electronegative atom or in an environment where neighboring protons are absent. Like a CH3 connected to an oxygen, like an epoxide's adjacent group? Or maybe a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (like a toluene group).
Wait, but the compound after the reaction is the product. So if the starting material was an epoxide, and upon reaction (maybe ring-opening), what would that look like?

Wait, the product's NMR might not be the starting epoxide but the product after reaction. So the reaction with diazabicyclooctane. Oh wait, if the starting material is an epoxide, and treated with a base, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but wait, sometimes epoxides can also undergo other reactions. Alternatively, maybe the starting material was a diene, and the reaction formed an epoxide via some process like opening an epoxide? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the product's molecular formula is given as C11H12O. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0, N=0. So (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So six degrees of unsaturation: probably a benzene ring (3) and other rings or double bonds. So maybe a benzene ring, a double bond, and an epoxide (which has a three-membered ring with two double bonds, but wait, an epoxide has one double bond. So perhaps a benzene (3), a double bond (1), and another ring (maybe a three-membered ring, so that's another double bond? Or maybe a cyclopropane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the product's 1H NMR:

- δ 2.28 and 2.31 are two singlets, each integrating to 3H. That's interesting. Two separate methyl groups, each as singlets. So maybe two different methyl groups in the structure. Could they be attached to different parts of the molecule, like perhaps a benzene ring and another group?

Then the aromatic protons: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). So this looks like a para-substituted benzene. Wait, but why four different signals? Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene? Or maybe a substituent on the benzene that creates a di-substituted pattern.

Wait, let me think: the aromatic region has two doublets, one with 2H and another with 2H, plus two singlets. Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that they create coupling in the aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted styrene group. 

Looking at the 13C NMR:

The carbons are as follows:

- 21.3 (1C, s): Could be a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like a methoxy or epoxide. Wait 21 is quite low, maybe a CH3 attached to an oxygen in an epoxide? Or perhaps a methyl adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, 197.7 is a very high shift, indicating a carbonyl group. But wait, the product's formula is C11H12O. If 197 is a carbonyl, then we have an oxygen as a carbonyl, but wait, the product is from the reaction of X with the base. Hmm, maybe the product is an epoxide, but the starting material X was different.

Wait, but wait: the reaction conditions. If the starting material X is, say, an epoxide, and it's treated with a strong base, perhaps it undergoes ring-opening. Alternatively, if X is a diene, the reaction could form an epoxide via some oxidation. Hmm, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe it's an acid-base reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene, and the reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction. But in that case, the product would be a six-membered ring with substituents. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening. Because diazabicyclooctane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, it can deprotonate something. If X is an epoxide, the base could facilitate an SN2 attack. But without knowing X's structure, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pericyclic reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's focus on the NMR data of the product.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the high value at 197.7 is a carbonyl, but maybe it's an epoxide carbon. Wait, epoxide carbons are around 60-70 ppm? Or maybe I'm confusing. Wait, in 13C NMR, an epoxide carbon is typically around 50-60 ppm. Wait, but 197 is way higher. Could that be a carbonyl group, like a ketone? Hmm, but that might not fit with the reaction conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the product has a carbonyl group from an ester or ketone, which is formed from some reaction, perhaps a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, if an epoxide ring opens under basic conditions, the oxygen could become an alcohol and then perhaps undergo some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative, but that's just a wild guess.

Alternatively, let's think about the 1H NMR. The two singlet methyl groups at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm. Maybe they're both attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons. For example, in a structure like (CH3)2C-O- or similar.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows other signals: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s). These are all in the aromatic or sp2 regions.

So, considering the aromatic carbons, perhaps the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring. The multiplicities in the 1H NMR suggest a substitution pattern with coupling. Let's think: the 1H NMR has two doublets for the aromatic region, each integrating to two and one protons. Wait, that might suggest a substituent with a double bond, perhaps a styryl group.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? No, because each peak is a doublet, and the integration doesn't add up to three protons.

Wait, let's think about the aromatic region. If it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions that cause the protons to couple in a certain way. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene with a double bond substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted styrene group.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of unique protons. The 1H NMR has 3H(s) * 2 (so 6H in total for methyl groups), but wait, each is 3H, so 2 of them. Then the aromatic region: 1+2+1+2 = 6H. So in total, 6 +6=12 H? But the molecular formula is C11H12O, which has 12 H. So that adds up. So the product has 12 H.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons sum to 6: 1+2+1+2=6. So that's correct.

So let me try to imagine the structure. So, the product has two methyl groups as singlets, perhaps attached to an oxygen, and a substituted benzene ring.

Wait, looking at the options, let me see what each option is.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the structure would be an oxirane (epoxide) ring with a styryl group attached. The styryl group is a benzene ring connected via a vinyl group. So structure is O-C-O with a CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3 (since 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene with methyl at para and vinyl at ortho, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Alternatively, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide (oxirane) where one of the oxygens is connected to a styryl group. So the structure would be O-C-O with a CH2-CH-C6H4- (but wait, styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene, so it's CH2=CH-C6H4-).

Wait, but then what about the product's NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with two substituents: a methylene group and a vinyl group.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the reaction. The starting material X is reacted with the base to form the product. If the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is C11H12O. Let's think: if X was an epoxide, C11H10O perhaps? But wait, the reaction conditions would determine that.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options and their possible product structures.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, the structure is an epoxide connected to a styryl group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
     |
     CH2-CH2-C6H4?

Wait, no, styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-.

So, the structure would be an oxirane where one of the oxygens is connected to a CH2 group that's part of a styryl group. So the oxirane is O-C-O, with one O connected to CH2-CH2-C6H4 (but wait, the exact structure depends on substitution).

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C-O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3?

No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with substituents. Let me think about the 13C NMR.

In the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product has a ketone group. How would that form?

If the starting material was an epoxide and it ring-opened under basic conditions, perhaps forming a diol. But that would not form a ketone. Alternatively, if it underwent a ring-opening with a base to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a [2,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, like a Cope rearrangement or Claisen. But under what conditions? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide with a base, creating an alcohol, which then undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. That's plausible.

So, if X is an epoxide, and after ring-opening and elimination, the product has a carbonyl group.

Looking at option D: 2-styrylepoxide. If X is 2-styrylepoxide, then reacting it with a base might cause a ring-opening. But would that give a product with a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the product has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Because the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is typical for a carbonyl in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, if the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, how would that structure look?

Looking at the 1H NMR: the aromatic protons are split into doublets. Maybe the substituents on the benzene are such that there's a conjugated system.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached at position 2. So, the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 (4-methyl).

If the product is this structure, the 1H NMR would have the epoxide protons, but the given product's NMR doesn't show any protons near 3-4 ppm, which is typical for epoxide protons. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, but the product's NMR doesn't have any protons in what would be the typical epoxide region. So maybe the product is not an epoxide but something else.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the product's formula is C11H12O. Let's count the carbons. How many carbons does each option have?

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is C8H7 (since benzene is C6H5, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so styryl is C7H6?), but wait, 4-methylstyryl would be C8H7. Then the oxirane is O-C-O, so the structure is oxirane with a C8H7 group. So total carbons would be 2 (from the oxirane) + 8 (styryl) = 10. Wait, but the product has 11 C. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe the oxirane contributes two carbons, and the substituent is styryl (which is 8 carbons?), but 2+8=10, but the product has 11 carbons. So maybe the substituent is longer.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Let's see: propenyl is 3 carbons. The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the group is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-O-.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-C(CH2-O-)... Hmm.

But perhaps the substituent for option B is (Ph)C=CH-O-CH2, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has substituent methyl at position 2 and styryl at position 3. So the structure would have an epoxide ring with substituents.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the oxirane has a styryl group attached at position 2.

Wait, back to the product. The product has a carbonyl (197.7), so perhaps it's a ketone. So, if the product is a ketone, what would that imply about the starting material?

Perhaps the starting material X was an epoxide which, upon reaction, opened to form a carbonyl group. For example, if the epoxide underwent a ring-opening followed by elimination to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X was a diene, and the reaction formed an epoxide by some pericyclic reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually forms ketones from epoxides. But Baeyer-Villiger requires a ketone oxide, I think, and a peroxide. Not sure if the reaction conditions here fit.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a strong base. So perhaps it's deprotonating something, causing the epoxide to open.

Another approach: let's analyze the product's NMR.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups, which are probably attached to something that doesn't split their signals. So, perhaps two methyl groups attached to an oxygen or a carbon that doesn't have neighboring Hs.

The 13C NMR shows two carbons around 21 and 28 ppm, which are likely CH3 groups. 21 is more like a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom (like O), while 28 might be a CH3 attached to a carbon with more substituents, like a quaternary carbon.

So, perhaps structure has a CH3-O and a CH3-CR2 or something.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the carbons in the aromatic region are at 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C). That suggests a para-substituted benzene with perhaps two substituents.

Wait, let me think about the aromatic region. For a para-substituted benzene, the carbons are typically two sets: the carbons adjacent to substituents (ortho) and the meta, but in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other.

Wait, but the 13C NMR doesn't have a peak for a carbonyl at 197.7, but that's in the product. So the product has a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So the structure would be something like:

Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-Ar

Wait, no, perhaps a simpler structure. Let me think of the 1H NMR. The aromatic protons are split into doublets. For an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the coupling would come from the conjugated double bonds.

But I'm not making much progress. Let's think of each option's structure and their possible NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure would be O-C-O with a styryl group attached. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's O-C-O with a CH2 group connected to a styryl group (CH2=CH-C6H4-). So the structure would be O-C-O-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3? No, maybe the structure is O-C-O-CH2-CH2-C6H4-.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think about the product's NMR.

If the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the structure would have a conjugated double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, (E)- or (Z)-cinnamaldehyde, but that's an aldehyde, not a ketone.

But in the product, the 1H NMR shows doublets for aromatic protons, possibly indicating a coupling through a double bond. So perhaps the product has a structure where the benzene is connected via a double bond to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

O
||
C-CH2-C6H4-CH3

But that would be an acetyl group attached to a benzene ring. But then the NMR would have different patterns.

Alternatively, the structure could be a benzaldehyde derivative, but the NMR doesn't show any aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm).

Wait, the 1H NMR doesn't show any protons around 9-10 ppm, so it's not an aldehyde. But the 13C has a peak at 197.7 which is a carbonyl. So, maybe it's a ketone.

So, structure: Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? But that would be a simple ketone, but then the aromatic protons wouldn't match.

Alternatively, Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-C6H5? No, but that would be a larger molecule.

Wait, maybe the product is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone group. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trityl group with a ketone, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR also shows a carbon at 144.1 and 141.5, which are likely to be carbons attached to oxygen, like carbonyl carbons or carbons in an aromatic ring attached to a substituent.

The 13C at 197.7 is a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a ketone and a double bond.

Putting it together, perhaps the product is something like 4-methyl-3-buten-2-one, but attached to a benzene ring. Wait, but that's more like acetophenone derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a methyl vinyl ketone attached to a benzene ring. For example, something like benzylideneacetone or similar.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 1H NMR shows a triplet of doublets in the aromatic region, but perhaps it's a trans coupling in a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone attached. But I'm not making much progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a result of an elimination reaction from an epoxide. For example, opening the epoxide to form a diol, which then eliminates a water molecule to form a carbonyl group.

In that case, the product would have a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, let's say X is an epoxide with substituents. When the base opens the epoxide, it forms an alcohol, which then undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group and a double bond.

So, the product would have a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR, the aromatic protons might be part of a styryl group, which is a benzene ring attached via a double bond.

So, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. But the NMR doesn't show any aldehyde protons. So, maybe a ketone.

Wait, if the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the structure would be Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-. But then the NMR might show protons on the double bond.

Wait, but the 1H NMR doesn't show any protons in the vinyl region (like around 5-6 ppm), which would be expected for a double bond. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the double bond is part of the aromatic ring, so it's a styryl group. Let me think: the structure would be Ar-CH2-C(=O)-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-4-methyl-3-penten-2-one, but attached to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-methylacetophenone. But then the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which is present here as the 2.28 (3H, s) peak.

Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be a single set if it's para-substituted. But the given NMR has four different peaks.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR of the product, the aromatic protons are at 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), and 7.71 (d, 2H). 

This suggests a para-disubstituted benzene, but with each substituent causing different coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,3-disubstituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that itself has a double bond. For example, a substituent like CH2-C(=O)-R, but that may complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the benzene, leading to coupling in the aromatic region.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR shows a doublet for 1H at 6.75 and another for 1H at 7.68. These could be the protons on a double bond adjacent to the benzene, like in a styryl group.

So, the structure could be something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R

But then the NMR would show protons on the CH2 groups, which we don't see.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. That would be acetophenone with a methyl group, but the NMR might show the CH2 as a triplet or something else.

Wait, but looking back, the 1H NMR doesn't show any protons between δ 2.3 and δ 3.0, which would be typical for a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is directly attached to the benzene. For example, acetophenone: Ph-C(=O)-CH3. Then the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which is present in the 1H NMR as 2.28 (s, 3H). Then the aromatic protons would be a singlet for the para position, but in the given NMR, they are split into multiple peaks.

Wait, but in acetophenone, the aromatic protons are ortho and para to the ketone group. So, the substituent is at position 4 (para), so the aromatic protons at positions 2,3,5,6 would be two sets of doublets. Wait, no, in acetophenone, the aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6, which are ortho and meta to the ketone. So, perhaps two doublets.

But in the product's 1H NMR, there are four peaks in the aromatic region, which might suggest a more complex substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is more complex, like a vinyl group attached to the benzene and a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Wait, let's consider the 13C NMR. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to oxygen or double bonds. The 127.1 (1C) and 130.3 (1C) could be carbons in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a double bond. For example, something like Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. But in that case, the NMR would have protons on the CH2 groups, which aren't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH2- something, but again, the CH2 groups would show up in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2. But that would have a quaternary carbon and a methyl group, which may fit the 13C NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2. Let me think: that would have a singlet for the two methyl groups attached to the CH. But in the 1H NMR, the two methyl groups are singlets, so that could fit.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows two separate carbons for the methyl groups, 21.3 and 28.4, suggesting they are attached to different environments. So perhaps one is attached to an oxygen and the other is attached to a quaternary carbon.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to look at the options again.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The structure would be oxirane (epoxide) with a substituent at position 2. The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which would be:

Ph-C(CH2-O-) double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, but that might not sum up correctly.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-O- attached to the epoxide ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the product's molecular formula again, C11H12O.

If the product has a carbonyl group (197.7 ppm), perhaps it's a ketone, and the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3

But let's count the carbons: benzene (6 C) + CH2 (2 C) + C=O (1 C) + CH2CH3 (2 C) → total 6+2+1+2=11 C. That fits.

So the structure would be 4-methylacetophenone: Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, structure would be Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. But that's more like pentan-3-one attached to benzene.

But wait, acetophenone is Ph-C(=O)-CH3, which has 8 carbons (6 in benzene, 1 in C=O, 1 in CH3). But the product has 11 C, so perhaps more substituents.

Wait, but in any case, the NMR of the product doesn't show any protons in the CH2 regions, so perhaps the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2. That would be a ketone with a gem-dimethyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-C(=O)-C(CH3)2

That would have:

- A benzene ring (6 C)
- A carbonyl carbon (1 C)
- A central carbon attached to the carbonyl and two methyl groups (1 C)
- Two methyl groups (2 C x 2 = 4 H?), but wait, each CH3 has 3 H.

So the molecular formula would be C9H10O. But the product has C11H12O. So not matching. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options. The options are all epoxides (oxiranes) with various substituents.

Wait, but the product after reaction with a base is the product. So if X is an epoxide, and the reaction forms a new product, which has a carbonyl group, perhaps X is an epoxide and the product is a ketone.

So, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of X (the epoxide) to form a ketone. Let's imagine that.

So, X is an epoxide, which upon ring-opening forms a ketone. How?

Epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically leads to nucleophilic attack. But if the epoxide is part of a larger structure, perhaps the ring-opening can lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure, and upon opening, forms a ketone. For example, if the epoxide is in a six-membered ring with a bridge, opening could form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting epoxide is vicinal, and the ring-opening leads to a conjugated dienone or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a di-substituted epoxide where ring-opening followed by elimination forms a carbonyl.

But I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the product is a result of a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement is when a diol (from epoxide ring-opening) undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. But that requires a 1,2-diol, which would come from an epoxide with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. But the reaction conditions here involve a strong base, which could lead to that.

So, if X is an epoxide, and the base induces ring-opening to form a diol, which then eliminates to form a carbonyl.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group.

Now, considering the NMR data, the product has a carbonyl, two methyl groups, and a substituted benzene.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzalacetone or similar.

Wait, another angle: looking at the 13C NMR, the two carbons at 126.9 and 127.1 could be the two carbons of the double bond in a styryl group. The 130.3 and 129.1 could be the carbons attached to the oxygen or part of the aromatic ring.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about each option's structure and their NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide with a styryl group attached. So, the structure would be O-C-O connected via a CH2 group to a styryl group (CH2=CH-C6H4-). But then the 1H NMR would show protons from the epoxide (around 3-4 ppm), which aren't present in the given data. So perhaps this is not the product.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure would be an epoxide with a substituent like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So, the structure would be O-C-O attached to a CH2 group, which is part of a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. The H NMR would show protons on the epoxide ring (if any) and the vinyl group. But again, the product's NMR doesn't show any protons in the range for epoxide protons.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be an epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-C6H3-CH3 (4-methyl). The 1H NMR would show the vinyl protons, but the given data don't show any in that region. So maybe this is not the case.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the epoxide has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. The structure would have an oxirane ring with substituents. The 1H NMR would show vinyl protons, but again, the product's data don't show any.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR doesn't have any protons in the 5-6 ppm region, which is typical for vinyl protons. So perhaps the product doesn't have a vinyl group, which suggests that the starting material's vinyl group has been transformed.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has peaks in the 120-130 ppm range, which are typical for sp2 carbons, including those in double bonds. So, the product likely has a double bond.

But wait, if the product has a carbonyl and a double bond, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, the structure would be something like:

Ar-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3

But again, the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, which would have a ketone and a propyl group. But the 1H NMR doesn't show any protons on the CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ar-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2, which would have a singlet for the two methyl groups attached to the CH. That fits the 1H NMR data: two singlets for the methyl groups.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-C(=O)-C(CH3)2

But let's count the carbons: benzene (6 C) + C=O (1 C) + C(CH3)2 (1 C) + 2*(CH3) (2 C) = 6 +1 +1 +2 =10 C. But the product has 11 C. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2

But then the carbons would be 6 (Ph) + 2 (CH2) +1 (C=O) +1 (CH) + 2*(CH3)=6+2+1+1+2=12 C. Which is more than the product's 11 C.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the options.

The product has a 13C at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product is a ketone. The two methyl groups (at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm) are each as singlets, likely attached to an oxygen or a quaternary carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2

Which would have:

Ph (6 C) + C=O (1 C) + CH(CH3)2 (1 C) + 2*(CH3) (2 C) → total 6+1+1+2=10 C. But the product has 11 C, so not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps another substituent is present.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of signals in each NMR.

In the 1H NMR, there are five signals: two singlets (methyl), and three doublets (aromatic). So, the structure has a high degree of symmetry.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So, maybe they are attached to different parts of the molecule, each in a symmetric environment.

The 13C NMR has 9 signals: two for methyl, two for aromatic (but wait, the aromatic region has 6 carbons?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzalacetone. For example, the structure would be:

Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2

But as before, the carbon count doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like (Ph)2C-C(=O)-CH3. But that would have a central carbon connected to two benzene rings and a ketone. However, the 1H NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the ketone, which is present here.

But the molecular formula would be C13H10O, which is higher than the product's C11H12O.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone derivative, but again, the carbon count may not fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is dimethyl 4-phenylbut-2-enyl ketone or similar, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. The structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group. But the product's NMR doesn't show any protons from the epoxide ring, which would typically be around δ 3-4 ppm, so perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but something else.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and the base. So, the product is formed from X. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the product is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol formed from the epoxide ring-opening, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about this: if X is an epoxide, and upon treatment with a strong base, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Then, under certain conditions, the diol could lose water to form a carbonyl group, leading to a ketone or aldehyde.

For example, if X is a vicinal di-tertiary epoxide, the ring-opening could form a diol which then eliminates to form a ketone.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group and perhaps a double bond.

Looking at the product's 13C NMR, the 197.7 is the carbonyl. The aromatic signals suggest a benzene ring with substituents.

So, if the product is a benzaldehyde derivative, but without the aldehyde proton, perhaps it's a ketone.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzalacetone derivative, but I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. But the product's NMR doesn't show any epoxide protons, so perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the epoxide, but another part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a new epoxide. But that doesn't seem to fit with the product's NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't an epoxide but something else, and the reaction forms an epoxide.

Wait, but the question states that X was subjected to a reaction with the base, which suggests that X is the starting material, and the product is formed.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR data.

The product has a carbonyl group and two methyl groups. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the structure is 4-methylacetophenone.

But 4-methylacetophenone's molecular formula is C9H10O. The product has C11H12O, so perhaps there's another substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is 4-methylpentan-3-one with a benzene ring attached. For example, the structure could be:

Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3

But that would have more carbons than needed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one with a benzene ring attached. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: looking at the 13C NMR, the two carbons at 126.9 and 127.1 (each 2C and 1C) could be part of a conjugated system, like a styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-C=O). But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH3)2

Which would have a benzene ring, a CH2 group, a ketone, and a quaternary carbon with two methyl groups. The 1H NMR would show the two methyl groups as singlets, which matches. The aromatic protons would be a single peak if para-substituted, but in the given data, there are four peaks, so this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a double bond, leading to the aromatic protons being split into multiple peaks.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. This could suggest a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a 1,3-disubstituted benzene with substituents that cause coupling in the aromatic region.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. The 21.3 is likely a CH3 attached to an oxygen (like OCH3), but wait, the product's formula is C11H12O, so maybe it's a CH3-O- group. The 28.4 could be a CH3 attached to a carbon with branching, like a quaternary carbon.

So, perhaps the structure has a OCH3 group and a CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows two singlets for 3H, which would fit OCH3 and CH(CH3)2.

But in that case, the 1H NMR would show a singlet for the OCH3, which is around δ 3.3-3.7. But the given 1H NMR has methyl groups at δ 2.28 and 2.31, which are lower, suggesting they're attached to carbons, not oxygen.

So, perhaps the 21.3 is a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom, like O. But if it's not OCH3, maybe it's a CH3 attached to a carbonyl, like a ketone.

For example, in acetophenone, the CH3 group is attached to the carbonyl and appears as a singlet around δ 2.6, but in the product, it's at 2.28 and 2.31. So perhaps the structure has two different methyl groups attached to carbonyls or other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The product has a carbonyl and two methyl groups. Looking at the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. If the product is derived from this and the reaction opens the epoxide to form a carbonyl, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the product's NMR doesn't show any protons that would come from the epoxide. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. If the product is a di-substituted benzene with two methyl groups, perhaps in para positions, but the given NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Wait, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the NMR data and the reaction conditions, the product is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would suggest that the starting material was an epoxide that underwent ring-opening and elimination to form the ketone.

Looking at the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. If this undergoes ring-opening to form a ketone, the product would have a carbonyl and a styryl group, which could fit the NMR data.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane under specific conditions. The product's molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, and its NMR data is provided. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for methyl groups, likely attached to carbons without neighboring protons.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), and δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with coupling.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - Peaks at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: Likely methyl groups, with the former possibly attached to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).
   - Peaks in the range δ 126.9–130.3: Aromatic carbons.
   - Peak at δ 197.7: A carbonyl group, likely part of a ketone or aldehyde.

### Reaction and Product Analysis:
- The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a strong base, which typically facilitates epoxide ring-opening or related transformations.
- The product's NMR data indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (δ 197.7), two methyl groups, and a para-substituted benzene ring. This suggests the product is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or a related structure.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   This structure contains an epoxide ring and a styryl group. However, the product's NMR does not show protons typical of an epoxide (δ 3–4 ppm), making this option unlikely.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   This structure includes an epoxide ring and a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. Similar to Option A, the absence of epoxide protons in the product's NMR makes this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   This structure features an epoxide ring and a styryl group with a methyl substituent. Again, the lack of epoxide protons in the product's NMR data makes this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   This structure consists of an epoxide ring and a styryl group. While the product's NMR does not show epoxide protons, the reaction conditions and the presence of a carbonyl group in the product suggest that the starting material (X) could be an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening and elimination to form a ketone. This aligns with the product's NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reaction conditions and the NMR data, the most plausible structure for Compound X is **2-styrylepoxide**, as it can undergo the described transformations to yield the observed product.
