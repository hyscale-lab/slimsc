Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, so I should probably start by analyzing those to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know X, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group because that's where O-H stretching usually appears. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably due to aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl substituent and an -OH group.

Now, the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is indicative of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually sharp. Alternatively, an -OH proton in an acid would be around 10-12 ppm, but the IR suggested an -OH. Wait, but the IR's 3400-2500 is a broad peak, which matches an -OH. So maybe the 10.5 is an -OH? Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait another thought: A broad singlet around 10 could be an acidic proton, maybe a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acid protons are typically around 10-12 ppm and can be broad. Let me think. So if the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid, that would fit with the IR's 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So maybe an acid is present.

Looking at the other peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is probably aromatic protons. The doublet suggests that each proton has one neighboring H. So perhaps para-substituted aromatic ring. So if there's a substituent in the para position, the protons adjacent would be two doublets.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, another doublet. So maybe they're two sets of doublets, like a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents: one in position 4 and another in position 1? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents would influence the NMR. So if the ring has two substituents in para, like a para-dimethyl? Or perhaps more accurately, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think again. The NMR peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm for doublets each integrating to 2H. So perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene with two sets of equivalent protons. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with substituents that deshield the protons in certain positions. Or perhaps the ring has substituents that cause the protons to split into two doublets. Oh wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 4, but that would actually give two sets of doublets. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in a position that makes the ring have two doublets. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me come back to this.

Next peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, 1H. That sounds like a CH group adjacent to some other groups. Maybe a CH next to an oxygen or something. Like a secondary alcohol or an ether? But wait, the IR had a carbonyl. Maybe it's a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a branched chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, integrating to 2H. Maybe a CH2 group next to a CH or something else. Like part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet, 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, 3H. That's a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring, substituents that give two doublets (so maybe para substituents), and a side chain that includes a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or perhaps a butyl group?

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

The IR has a carbonyl (1720), which could be a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then in the NMR, we might see a peak for the carbonyl adjacent CH groups. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be part of an ester group. But the IR 1720 is more typical for a ketone or an aldehyde or possibly an ester. Or, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but 1720 is a bit higher, which might point more toward an ester or a ketone.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR: if it's a carboxylic acid, that would have an O-H peak in the IR around 2500-3300, which is present. Also, the 1720 would fit with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually a bit lower, like around 1700 cm-1. Hmm, 1720 could be an ester or an acid chloride, but acid chloride would have a higher carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is a broad singlet. Maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but are usually sharp. Wait, but sometimes if there's hydrogen bonding, it can be broader. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a phenolic O-H. Phenolic O-Hs can be broad and around 10 ppm. But then the IR's 3400-2500 would be the O-H stretch of a phenol. Then the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl, which would fit as an ester or ketone. Let's think: phenol with a ketone?

Wait, but looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 is 1H. Phenol has one O-H, so that's possible. Then the aromatic peaks: suppose the benzene is para-substituted with a carbonyl group and a phenolic OH. Or perhaps the benzene has an ester group and an OH group. Hmm.

But wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like CH2CH2CH3. So perhaps there's an ethyl group or a butyl group attached somewhere.

Looking at the downfield shifts:

The 10.5 (maybe OH or aldehyde), 8.0 and 7.2 (aromatic), 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

Wait, the 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3. The 1.4 doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH. The 2.9 (m, 1H) would be a CH group connected to a carbonyl perhaps.

Putting together the side chain: Maybe it's a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group? No, wait, the 1.4 is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2 and then CH3. Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. The aromatic part has substituents which cause the NMR to have two doublets. Let's say substituents are in the para position. Let me think: If the benzene has two substituents in the para positions, one being a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and the other being a chain.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 and 7.2, which are two doublets. Let's think of something like a 4-substituted benzaldehyde, but then the aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, the 10.5 is a singlet, which might not be aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options given.

The options are A to D. Let's read them:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzoic acid group (carboxylic acid) at position 4, and a sec-butyl group attached? Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have a benzoic acid (COOH) group at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. But wait, benzoic acid is a COOH attached to the benzene, typically at position 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure is a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid. The phenyl is at position 4 of the benzene (since it's 4-ethyl), and the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene at position 2. So the structure is:

Phenyl group is attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid. Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid at position 2. Hmm.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid is at position 1 (the first carbon), and a sec-butyl group is at position 4. So the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) at position 4.

But wait, the IR of the original compound has a peak at 1720, which would fit a carbonyl. In benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, so 1720 is close. So option C's structure would have a benzoic acid group, which would have a carbonyl around 1700, which fits.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. That would be a toluene derivative with a substituent.

Hmm, but let's get back to the NMR data. Let's try to see if any of the options fit.

Looking at the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm peak: in option C, benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. That matches the 10.5 peak. So that fits.

The aromatic peaks: for benzoic acid, the ring would have substituents, so the protons would split into certain patterns. But in option C, benzoic acid is at position 1, and a sec-butyl is at position 4. So the benzene would have two substituents: COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. So the ring would be 1-(COOH) and 4-(sec-butyl). Then the remaining protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Those would be equivalent in pairs, perhaps leading to two doublets in NMR.

Wait, but if the substituents are at 1 and 4, the ring would have symmetry. So the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, we'd expect two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks would correspond to these protons.

Now, looking at the other parts of the NMR: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might correspond to the CH in the sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), so the CH in the middle would have a proton. But wait, in the NMR, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl of the ethyl group in the sec-butyl.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the middle CH has two CH2 groups attached. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the central CH is connected to two CH2 groups and the benzene.

So, in the NMR, the central CH would have a proton, which would be split into a multiplet because it's adjacent to two sets of protons (the two CH2 groups). So the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be that. The CH2 groups would split into either a quartet or a triplet, but their integration sums to 2H, so perhaps they're split into a multiplet.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups in the sec-butyl. Each would be split, but their signals would overlap into a multiplet.

The 1.4 (d, 3H) is the methyl attached to the central CH. The 0.9 (t, 3H) is the end of the ethyl chain.

So putting this together, the NMR matches option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the 10.5 peak again. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But benzoic acid's O-H is usually a broad peak around 10 ppm. So that matches the 10.5 peak.

So when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, wait. Wait, Clemmensen reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes, but in the presence of red P and HI, I think it's for the reduction of carbonyl groups, but wait another thought: Wait, sometimes in the presence of HBr, but maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: If the compound has an ester group, but I don't see that in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group, but I don't think so.

Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, would the reaction with red P and HI do anything? Wait, I might be mixing reactions. Let me think: the Clemmensen reduction uses H2O/H2O2 and CrO3 for acid workup, but wait, no, that's oxidation.

Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if Compound X has a ketone group, then the product would be an alkane.

Wait, but the options don't have a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis. But no, red phosphorus and HI are more about reductions.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a nitrile, but that's not indicated by the IR.

Wait, another reaction: the use of red phosphorus and HI is also used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to alkenes, but that doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure of X again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I got the reaction wrong. Red phosphorus and HI is used for the elimination of HX from vicinal dihalides. Alternatively, maybe it's for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Let me think: I think the Clemmensen reduction is done under acidic conditions with HCl, using red phosphorus to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if the starting material is a ketone, the product would be an alkane.

But in this case, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is reduced.

Wait, but wait. Carboxylic acids are typically reduced under different conditions. For example, using LiAlH4 would reduce a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile group, but I don't think X has a nitrile.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let's go back to the structure of X. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is saponification, but that typically uses a base, not HI.

Alternatively, maybe X is a nitrile, which would be reduced to an amine, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce alkenes via the Hunsdiecker reaction, but that's for converting alkenes to alkyl halides. Alternatively, in the presence of an alkyne, it can lead to different reactions.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) to an alcohol. But with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps it's the oxymercuration reaction, but that uses mercury and water, not red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps it's the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but that uses aluminum isopropoxide and an alcohol, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what do we get?

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting that with red phosphorus and HI would probably reduce the carbonyl group of the acid to a methylene group. But wait, how?

Wait, benzoic acid (COOH) has a carbonyl group. If reduced, it would become benzyl alcohol (CH2OH). But wait, the reaction conditions might not do that.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings. But that's typically done with amphoteric metals like copper in ammonia, and it adds hydrogen to the ring. But red phosphorus and HI might not do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. Let me think: If X is benzoic acid, then treatment with H2 and a catalyst would reduce the COOH to CH2OH. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to a methyl group. Wait, but I don't recall a reaction that does that. Maybe the reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group.

Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, ketones are reduced to alkanes. So if X has a ketone group, then the product would be a compound with a CH2 group in place of the carbonyl.

Wait, but X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the carbonyl is from the acid. How would that react?

Another possibility: Perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe the benzoic acid is converted into benzyl bromide. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate the NMR. The 10.5 peak could be an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically have a sharp peak around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, it's a broad peak, which is more characteristic of an -OH or an NH group. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually a sharp peak.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a phenol. So, if the structure is a phenol with a carbonyl group, such as a para-hydroxybenzaldehyde or a para-hydroxyphenyl ketone.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. Let me think again about the reaction.

If X is benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carbonyl group (the acid) is converted into something else.

Wait, but for a benzoic acid, the reaction might not proceed unless it's activated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the benzoic acid into benzyl alcohol.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think: The reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alcohol typically requires more vigorous conditions, like using LiAlH4. Red phosphorus and HI may not do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the decarboxylation of the acid. But that usually requires heating and something else, like Mg or another metal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes when they're ketones or aldehydes. So if X has a ketone group, the product would have the ketone converted to a CH2 group.

Wait, but if X is a ketone, then the IR would show a peak around 1700-1750 cm-1. The given IR has 1720, which fits a ketone.

So if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a CH2 group.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. Let's say X is a ketone, like 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then the NMR would show a peak for the ketone adjacent CH. But in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which would correspond to a CH next to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's imagine the structure: benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone (CO) attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a sec-butyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group connected to a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but then the IR would have a peak at 1720 cm-1, which supports that.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then the NMR would show:

The aromatic protons as two doublets (2H each), the CH adjacent to carbonyl as a triplet or multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H), and the rest of the chain as per the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The substituent is a COCH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, the substituent would be COCH2CH(CH2CH3). So the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl, and the CH would be next to the CH2.

In the NMR, the carbonyl-adjacent CH2 would be a quartet (since it's next to a CH that has two protons). The CH would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which would be the CH group. The CH2 would be around 2.5-2.7 ppm as a quartet. Oh, but in the given data, there's a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be the CH, and then the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Wait, that doesn't fit because the CH2 groups would be upfield from the CH.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the chain is CH2-C(O)-Ph. No, wait, if X is a ketone, then perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, let's reconsider. Suppose the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl. So, the structure could be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Wait, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COCH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that would make the chain longer.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a COCH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but then the NMR would show a CH group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a COCH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but without getting too tangled, perhaps I should look at the reaction outcome.

If X is a ketone, then after reduction with red phosphorus and HI, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So, the product would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3, perhaps. Or another structure.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a CH2 group in place of a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each option and see what would happen when they react with red phosphorus and HI.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is option C, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the COOH group is converted into something else. But I'm not certain about this reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the acid into an acid chloride, but that's not indicated by the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the esterification of the acid. But that would require an alcohol, which isn't present in the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each option would produce when treated with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of alkenes to alkanes via the Hunsdiecker reaction. But if X has an alkene, then it would be reduced. But looking at the NMR and IR data, I don't see any peaks that suggest an alkene. The IR at 1610 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C, but the 1450 cm-1 is likely another aromatic peak. So perhaps X doesn't have an alkene.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester. Let's think: esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The NMR would have a peak around 4 ppm for the ester oxygen's adjacent CH2, but in the given NMR, there's nothing around 4 ppm. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. The IR of nitriles has a peak around 2250 cm-1, which isn't present here. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps X is an amide. But the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the amide I band. The IR given has 1610 cm-1, which might be the aromatic ring, and 1450 cm-1, perhaps the C-O from a phenol or the C=C.

Hmm. Let me think again about the possible structure of X. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a terminal CH3, as I thought before. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 (m, 2H) is a CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 2.9 (m, 1H) is the CH.

Putting this together, the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but the substituent is likely a butyl group.

Wait, the chain could be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it.

Wait, the substituent is probably a sec-butyl group, which is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So in the substituent, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the aromatic ring.

So, considering all that, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction reduces the benzoic acid group to benzyl alcohol. So the COOH would become CH2OH. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but I don't think that's likely with these reagents.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid to an aldehyde. But I don't think that's feasible with these reagents.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. So, the COOH becomes CH2OH. But again, I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible product when a benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't think so because the conditions don't seem right.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is the elimination of the acid to form an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride. But, again, I don't think so.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about the structure of X. Let me reevaluate the NMR and IR.

If the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde, then the structure would have a benzaldehyde group and some chain substituent. But the IR peak at 1720 would then be the aldehyde. Wait, no, aldehydes have lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 1720 cm-1 is possible for an aldehyde. Wait, actually, aldehydes typically show a strong peak around 1720 cm-1.

So if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, the aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, and the aromatic protons as doublets.

Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a terminal CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group leading to a CH3 at the end.

Putting that together, perhaps X is 4-(propyl)benzaldehyde. But then the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 (CH3), a quartet at 1.7 (CH2), a triplet at 2.6 (CH next to aldehyde), and a singlet for the aldehyde proton around 9.5 ppm.

But our NMR shows 10.5, which is a bit higher. Also, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, which would be a CH next to a CH2, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. The aldehyde proton would be around 9.5-10 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as observed. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group, which would give the NMR peaks as we see: 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3 attached to CH), and 0.9 (terminal CH3).

But wait, if X is a benzaldehyde, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group, right? So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Hmm.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then after reduction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2OH (alcohol) or perhaps CH3 (if fully reduced).

Wait, no, in the Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde is reduced to CH2 group. So benzaldehyde would become toluene. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the aldehyde because I've made a wrong assumption about X's structure.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's see each option and see which one fits the NMR and IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

IR: has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 (for the carbonyl of the acid), a broad peak from 3400–2500 (the O-H of the acid), and aromatic peaks. The NMR would have a broad peak around 10.5 ppm (the O-H of the acid), and the aromatic protons would be two doublets as in the data. The substituent (sec-butyl) would give the other peaks in the NMR.

So the NMR of option C fits.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. So, the COOH becomes CH2OH. Then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol.

But that's not one of the options. The options don't include an alcohol.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of benzyl bromide from the acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the decarboxylation of the acid to form an alkane. But I'm not certain about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the acid to an acid chloride, but again, I don't think that's done with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2. But that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's structure and reaction.

If X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), and I treat it with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH to COH (but that's not possible with these reagents).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: Maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit here because X is already a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but a ketone, and I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR of option C. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

In the NMR, the CH group (at the center of the sec-butyl) would appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The two CH2 groups (one adjacent to the benzene, one adjacent to the CH) would be at around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet, and the methyl groups would be at 1.4 (attached to the CH) and 0.9 (terminal methyl).

So the NMR data fits option C.

Then, when X (option C) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what's the product?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of the benzene ring, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but I don't think that's possible with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the substitution of the -COOH group. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the decarboxylation of the acid to form an alkene. But that would require specific conditions, like heat and a metal catalyst, which I'm not sure are present here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a reduction but an elimination. For example, if X has a β-hydroxy group, it could eliminate to form an alkene. But without that group, it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl bromide, but I don't think that's the case here.

I'm stuck. Let me recap:

- X has IR showing O-H (broad), carbonyl (1720), aromatic C=C.

- NMR shows aromatic protons (two doublets), a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), a CH2 (1.7, m), and two methyl groups (1.4, d and 0.9, t).

- Options suggest X is a benzoic acid (option C) or a substituted benzene with another group.

Assuming X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what product do we get?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the acid but about another part of the molecule. But I'm not seeing another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol, which would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But this isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of benzyl bromide, but that would require a different setup.

Wait, another angle: Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form a hydride. Let me think: maybe the benzoic acid isn't reacting, but another part of the molecule does.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But the IR doesn't show nitrile peaks, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester. If X is an ester, then reaction with HI could lead to hydrolysis, but that would require a base, which isn't present.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but again, I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aromatic ring. But with red phosphorus and HI, I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that requires a metal like Mg.

I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is option C, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol (if the carboxylic acid is reduced), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the acid group but another part. But I don't see another functional group in X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aromatic ring to a cyclohexane ring. But that's not indicated by the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the acid group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride. Red phosphorus and HI might react with the acid to form an acyl chloride. But I don't know the exact reaction conditions.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with PPH3 and HI, perhaps it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. But that's not among the options either.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the possible product structures.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, option D is a substituted toluene. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH3, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D but with methyl in a different position.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. That doesn't match the expected product if the COOH is reduced to CH3.

Wait, but that's getting too speculative. Maybe the reaction isn't about the acid but about another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that X isn't a benzoic acid. Let me think again.

If X isn't a benzoic acid, then what else could explain the IR and NMR?

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or ketone. The NMR's 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton.

Wait, let's consider the possibility that X is a benzaldehyde derivative. So, the structure could be 4-ethylbenzaldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows a methyl group at 0.9 ppm, which is a terminal CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a longer chain, like a propyl group.

Wait, let me consider option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

The structure would be a phenyl group at position 4 (with an ethyl group) attached to the alpha carbon of a propanoic acid.

In that case, the NMR would have:

- The aldehyde proton (but option A is a propanoic acid, not an aldehyde).

Wait, no. Propanoic acid has a COOH group. So the IR would have a peak around 1700 cm-1, which matches.

The NMR would have a peak around 10 ppm for the COOH O-H.

The aromatic protons would be as two doublets, which could fit.

The substituent would be a propyl group attached to the COOH, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which could be the terminal CH3 of the substituent.

Then, the chain would be CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the COOH.

But the NMR also has a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be the CH adjacent to the COOH.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3.

But in that case, the chain is a propyl group. But the NMR's 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which would be more like an isopropyl group.

Hmm. I'm not sure.

Another option: option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

The NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (if substituents are para), which matches.

- The substituent would be a sec-butyl group, giving the peaks at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So the NMR of option D would fit.

But then, what about the IR? The IR would need to have a peak around 1720 cm-1. If option D is a toluene derivative, it wouldn't have a carbonyl group, which contradicts the IR data.

So option D probably isn't the right structure for X.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4: isobutyl and methyl.

The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

The substituent (isobutyl) would have a CH(CH2CH3)2 group, giving peaks in the NMR.

The IR would have peaks for aromatic C=C, but no carbonyl, so the 1720 cm-1 would be unexplained. So option B probably isn't X.

So, back to option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is option C, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the COOH group is converted into a CH2 group, yielding 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

But that would be 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which isn't one of the options. The closest option is D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction causes the substitution of the COOH group with a methyl group. So, the product would have a methyl group where the COOH was.

That would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the acid but about another group. But I can't find another functional group in X.

So, based on all this, I think the correct answer is option C, and the reaction would reduce the acid group to a methyl, giving a product that's not in the options, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the reaction. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the reduction of ketones to alkanes. So if X is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

Looking back, if X is a ketone, like 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then after reduction, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

But option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be the same as 4-(sec-butyl)toluene if the methyl is in position 1, which is the same as 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene.

Wait, so if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, after reduction it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

But how does that fit with the NMR and IR data?

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, the IR would have a peak at 1720 cm-1 (the ketone), the aromatic peaks, and the O-H from where? Oh wait, in that case, the O-H wouldn't be present unless there's a phenol group. So the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 would need to be explained. If X is a ketone, there wouldn't be an -OH group, so the IR would only have the carbonyl peak and the aromatic peaks. But the IR given has a broad peak between 3400–2500, which suggests an -OH or NH group. So X can't be a ketone without an -OH group.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

Given the NMR and IR data, the structure of X is most likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to a methyl group, yielding 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D but with the substituents in different positions.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have the substituents in positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). But in the product from option C, the substituents would be at positions 1 (methyl) and 4 (sec-butyl), which is a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of option C with red phosphorus and HI doesn't affect the acid group but causes some other change. But I can't figure that out.

Given all this, I'll choose option C as X and assume the reaction leads to one of the options. But since the options don't directly match, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but an elimination. For example, if X is a benzoic acid with a β-hydroxy group, it could eliminate to form an alkene. But without that group in X, it's not possible.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the data, the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But the reaction product isn't given, which suggests I'm misunderstanding the reaction.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI, based on its IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an -OH group), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely an -OH or aldehyde proton), two doublets for aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). These NMR signals suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring with a side chain containing a sec-butyl group.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure includes a propanoic acid group and an ethyl-substituted benzene. However, the IR data does not strongly support a propanoic acid, and the NMR signals do not match the expected pattern for this structure.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a toluene derivative with an isobutyl and methyl group. However, the IR data lacks a peak consistent with a carbonyl group, which would be expected for this structure. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure includes a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carbonyl group of the acid, and the broad peak at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the -OH group. The NMR signals for the aromatic protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) and the sec-butyl group (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) align well with this structure. This option fits the data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and methyl group. The IR data does not support the presence of a carbonyl group, which would be necessary for this structure. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
If Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, forming **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**. However, this product is not explicitly listed among the options. Based on the given choices, the most consistent structure for X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
