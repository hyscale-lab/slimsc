Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Okay, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 mL, and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then you add 20 mL of water, making the total volume 40 mL. So the new concentration (M2) would be (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL. Let me calculate that.

0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 mL gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, is acetic acid a weak acid? Yes, it is. So when it's diluted, it dissociates a bit more, but the pH won't just be the pH of a strong acid solution.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the equivalence point first. Maybe that's easier.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Since the volume after dilution is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 mL of water, the volume becomes 40 mL, so the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, as I thought earlier.

Now, the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So at equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I need to find both.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of acetate ion.

The Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate ion at equivalence point: The total volume of the solution will be the volume of acetic acid solution plus the NaOH added. Initially, before adding NaOH, the solution is 40 mL. At equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 +10=50 mL or 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate ion is 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid is converted to acetate). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So now, using Kb for acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have pH at equivalence around 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong volume for the concentration. Let me see: moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Total volume after adding 10 mL NaOH is 50 mL. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, but in the options, the equivalence point pH is around 8.5, 6.7, 7, or 6.9. Wait, none of them are around 9. Did I make a mistake in thinking about the equivalence point?

Wait, wait. At equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. But wait, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So when dissolved in water, it hydrolyzes to produce a basic solution. So the pH should be above 7. But none of the options have pH higher than 8.5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the Kb and the concentrations.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution is not 0.02 M acetate. Let me think again.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added is 0.001 mol (since initially 0.001 mol of acetic acid), so moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 mL (diluted acid) + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL, so 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Kb is 5.405e-10. So [OH^-] is sqrt( (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps when you add 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid, the solution is not exactly 50 mL. Wait, but that's correct. 40 +10 is 50. Alternatively, maybe the initial moles are different.

Wait, no, initial moles after dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximations. Let's try that.

The equation is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 -x)

Assume x is small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98 → pH ~9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, another possibility: maybe the solution is not made correctly. Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you dilute it, the pH doesn't rise as much as expected. Hmm, no, that's about the initial pH, not the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I'm confused with strong and weak. No, sodium acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic. So why are the options' equivalence points below 8.5?

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A says 4.26;8.52. Option D says 4.57;6.92. Hmm. None have pH higher than 8.5 except A's second value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the concentration of acetate at equivalence. Hmm. Wait, no, it's 0.001 mol in 0.05 L, which is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps instead of using Kb, I should use the formula for a salt solution. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the acetate comes from NaOH, which is a strong base, so the solution is a buffer?

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the solution is just sodium acetate. So I think my approach is correct.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate the pH for the equivalence point using another method. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are wrong. Let me check again.

The initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then 20 mL of water is added, making total volume 40 mL. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH is 10 mL. So total volume is 50 mL. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximation. Let's write the equation again:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² = (5.405e-10) * (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, but perhaps it's not negligible. Let's compute without approximation.

But given Kb is 5.4e-10, and 0.02 is 2e-2, so Kb * 0.02 is 1.08e-11, which is much smaller than (0.02)^2, so x is about sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 1e-5. So 1e-5 is much smaller than 0.02, so approximation holds. So the initial calculation is correct.

Hmm, but the problem says pH at the equivalence point is in the options, but none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is not 0.02 M. Because when you add NaOH, the volume increases, but perhaps the moles are different. Wait, no, the moles are correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the acetic acid is a weak acid, and upon adding NaOH, some of the acetate may react with water. Oh, but at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so no, the solution is just acetate in water.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution. The pH can be found by:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

But wait, at equivalence, [HA] is zero, so that's not directly applicable. Instead, for a solution of A-, which is a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the Kb.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sodium acetate solution is a buffer, but no, because all the HA is converted to A-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using Kb. Let me think again. The Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10, which is correct.

So [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02 as equivalence point pH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.

The problem says 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, but when you add 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, you add 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol NaOH. So yes, equivalence point is achieved.

Hmm, but the options don't have pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the solution is not 50 mL. Wait, 40 mL +10 mL is indeed 50 mL.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact expression without approximation, but that's time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the equivalence point with another point. Let's think about the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is initial 40 mL + NaOH added (which is 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 2.5 mL). So total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → let's compute the ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253.

So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which seems close. Option D is 4.57, which is higher.

But wait, the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is way below 9. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe the equivalence point calculation is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is a buffer? No, because all the HA is converted to A-. So the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of A-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH using the hydrolysis equation without approximation.

The equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Change: -x → +x → +x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is wrong.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total 40 cm³. The new concentration is 0.05 *20 /40 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered that the diluted solution is 20 +20 =40 mL, so 0.04 L. So 0.05 M *0.02 L = 0.001 mol. 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I should reevaluate the equivalence point calculation. Let me see the options again.

The options for equivalence point are:

A)8.52

B)6.73

C)7.00

D)6.92

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong K value. Oh wait, wait a minute! At the equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a base. So the pH should be greater than 7. But all the options except A have equivalence pH below 7. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not at equivalence, but at 25% titration. Let me think again about the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using the method of salt solutions.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate, but maybe I'm miscalculating the concentration.

Wait, no, the concentration is definitely 0.02 M. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the NaOH is a strong base, and when you add it to the acetic acid, the solution becomes a buffer until the equivalence point. Wait, but once you pass the equivalence point, you have excess OH-. But in this case, at 25% titration, you are before equivalence.

Wait, but the problem is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I need to calculate both.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me try another approach.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base:

OH^- concentration = sqrt(Kb * C) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use the exact formula without assuming x is negligible.

Let me set up the equation:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x).

Let me rearrange:

x² + Kb x - (0.02 * Kb) =0.

Plugging in Kb=5.405e-10.

x² + 5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02 *5.405e-10) = -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 → approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11= approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

Since x must be positive, take the positive root.

x≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 3.288e-6.

Wait, but that's about 3.288e-6, which is larger than the previous 1.04e-5. Wait, that can't be right because 6.576e-6 is about 6.6e-6, so (6.6e-6 -5.4e-10) is about 6.6e-6.

So x≈3.3e-6.

Wait, but that gives [OH-]=3.3e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Oh! That's option A's equivalence point value. So I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering the exact solution of the quadratic equation.

Wait, so why is the [OH-] 3.3e-6? Because when I didn't neglect x, the value comes out higher.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Compute the quadratic formula.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² +4ac.

b² = (5.405e-10)^2 ≈2.92e-19.

4ac=4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, wait. The equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b^2 -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is much larger, so approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root.

x≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So the pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A's equivalence point.

So earlier, my approximation was wrong because x is not negligible. So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Now, for the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 -0.00025= 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is initial 40 mL + 2.5 mL NaOH (since 0.00025 mol /0.1 M=2.5 mL) → 42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425= approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425= approx 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa =-log(1.85e-5)=4.73.

log(0.005882/0.017647)= log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477≈4.253.

Which is about 4.25, and option A's first value is 4.26. So it's close.

So the pH at 25% titration is around 4.26, and equivalence point is 8.52. So option A is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The \(\text{K}_b\) for acetate ion is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(\text{K}_b\):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.020 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = \text{K}_b \times [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.020 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 \approx 9.02.
\]

However, using the quadratic formula for \(\text{K}_b\) without approximations gives a slightly lower \([\text{OH}^-]\), leading to a pH of approximately \(8.52\).

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \(8.52\). These values match the first option.

**Answer: A**
