Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I might have misread that. Oh, right, it's probably λ times something else. But maybe the exact form isn't crucial for figuring out the decay products. The important part is that X is a boson that interacts with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out which particles X can decay into at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed decays mean that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X, right? Because E=mc² and all that, so the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than X's mass.

So, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term would look something like X ψ ψ̄, meaning X can emit a fermion and antifermion. Wait, wait. The given Lagrangian is written as involving ψ_f, which I think is a fermion field. So X would couple to fermions, allowing it to decay into fermion pairs.

But wait, bosons can only decay into particles if the total energy allows. So, for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair must have at least its rest mass energy, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So first, I should list all possible fermions that X can decay into, considering their masses.

What are the known fermions? Let's see:

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.0005 GeV), muons (0.1057), taus (1.777), and their antiparticles.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But their masses vary.

Wait, but wait. For quarks, when considering bound states, but in free decay, the quark mass is relevant. So for each quark flavor, I'll need to consider their masses.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. The mass of the decaying boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow decay into that pair.

So let's list the fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.000511 GeV

Muon: ~0.1057 GeV

Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Up quark: around 2 MeV (so about 0.002 GeV), but sometimes considered as ~2.2 MeV.

Down quark: ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)

Strange quark: about 95-100 MeV (0.095 GeV)

Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV

Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV

Top quark: way too heavy, like ~173 GeV.

Wait, but in reality, the up and down quarks are light. So their rest mass is negligible compared to X's mass of 6 GeV.

But for the purpose of decay, even if the fermion is very light, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X, the decay is allowed.

Let me list the fermions and their masses:

Leptons:
- e: ~0.0005 GeV
- mu: ~0.105 GeV
- tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- u: ~0.002 GeV
- d: ~0.0047 GeV
- s: ~0.095 GeV
- c: ~1.27 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: way too heavy (so decay into t tbar is not possible for X=6 GeV)

So, for each fermion pair, check 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible fermion pair:

Electron pair: 2*0.0005=0.001 GeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

Muon pair: 2*0.1057=0.2114 GeV → allowed.

Tau pair: 2*1.777=3.554 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

u: 2*0.002=0.004 → allowed.

d: 2*0.0047=0.0094 → allowed.

s: 2*0.095=0.19 → allowed.

c: 2*1.27=2.54 → allowed.

b: 2*4.5=9 GeV → which is more than 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for a pair of fermions, 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So for b quarks: 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV. 9>6, so X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, but if the quark is a top quark, it's impossible because m_t is 173 GeV, which is way bigger than 6 GeV.

So, the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ubar,

d dbar,

s sbar,

c cbar.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that some include b bbar.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A) X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, if m_X=6 GeV, can X decay into b bbar? Because 2m_b=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So that's impossible. So any option including b bbar is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should consider the masses of the particles when they are produced.

Wait, when a particle decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So, for X → b bbar, the sum is 2*m_b. If m_b is around 4.5 GeV, then 2*4.5=9 GeV>6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

So any option that includes b bbar is not allowed.

Looking back at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. Option D includes b. So Options A and D are out.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So let's see: c cbar would require 2*m_c. m_c is about 1.27 GeV, so 2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

So Option B is X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer would include all possible fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV, which includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. 

Wait, but the option listed as B includes all of these except top, which is correct.

Wait, what about the bottom quark in option B? No, option B doesn't include b. So it's correct.

Wait, but what about the tau? Let me check.

Tau pair: 3.554 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed. So option B includes tau pair.

So, the allowed decay channels are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ubar,

d dbar,

s sbar,

c cbar.

So which option includes all of these?

Looking at the options:

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. That's all except b and t. So option B includes all allowed.

Option D includes b, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option B.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that covers all the allowed fermions. So the allowed decays are those pairs.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), we analyze the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

This indicates that \( X \) interacts with fermions (\( \psi_f \)) and can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy:

\[
2m_f \leq m_X,
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass of the boson \( X \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
The masses of the fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9.0 > 6.0 \)).
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

Thus, the allowed decay channels are:
\[
X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
