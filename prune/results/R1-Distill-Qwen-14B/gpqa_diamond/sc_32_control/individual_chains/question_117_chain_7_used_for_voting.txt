Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember correctly, happens when a compound has chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, leading to non-superimposable mirror images, which are enantiomers.

Let's look at the options one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. So that's a biphenyl structure. The substituents are nitro groups and carbonyl oxygens, I think. Wait, but does this have any chiral centers? Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality, like in binaphthyl compounds. Oh right, if the substituents on each benzene ring are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each benzene ring, at position 6, there's a nitro, and at position 2, a carbonyl group. But wait, the substituents are on opposite positions. So, is there a possibility of the biphenyl having a twist? If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that flipping the molecule would not make it the same, then it would have axial chirality, which leads to optical isomerism. But wait, are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical? Let me visualize. The two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So positions 2 and 6 are on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, but for each ring, it's a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, the numbers are 6,6' and 2,2'. So each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carbonyl group (as part of the ester) at 2. Wait, that's on each ring. So the substituents are in the same relative positions on each ring. So if the two rings are identical, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So perhaps it's symmetrical, which would mean no optical isomerism. But wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, like maybe one is trans and the other is cis? I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. Hmm. Maybe this one doesn't have optical isomerism. I'm not sure, but I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is CH3-C(O-OCH3)(OH)-something? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid would be HOOCCH(OH)CH3, but wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(COOH)CH2OH, wait no, wait. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, the third carbon is the COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But as an ester, it's methyl ester, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is HOCH2CH2COOH. So when you make the ester, it's HOCH2CH2COO-OCH3. So the molecule would have a hydroxyl group, a methyl ester, and a CH2 group. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think of the structure. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to: an OH group, a CH2COOCH3 group (which is the ester part), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon. It's connected to: an OH group, a CH2COOCH3 group (on one side), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again: the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH3, so the ester would be CH3OOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused about the numbering.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Numbering from the COOH end: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to: a hydroxyl, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the OH: it is connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group. Wait, no, wait: the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So the groups attached to it are: two CH2 groups (left and right), a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, the central carbon is CH2. So each CH2 has two H's. So, the central carbon is CH2, but attached to OH. No, here's the correct structure: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxy would make it HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH2) has two CH2 groups (left and right), an OH, and the COOCH3. Wait, actually, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to the OH. So the groups attached are: OH, two CH2 groups (each connected to another CH2), and a COOCH3 group. But wait, the central carbon is CH2, which is a secondary carbon with two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the carbons. Propanoate ester: 3 carbons in the acid. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups (the other CH2 and the COOCH3 group). Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps. Wait, no, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is perhaps CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, carbon 2 (the CH(OH) group) is connected to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH group. Wait, wait, no. Let me see the structure again. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH group, which is connected to the COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to: OCH3 (from the ester), CH3, OH, and the adjacent carbonyl group. So, in that case, the central carbon has four different groups: OCH3, CH3, OH, and the carbonyl group (which is part of the ester). If that's the case, then the central carbon is a chiral center. So, this compound would have optical isomerism. So option 2 shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, the carbonyl group is connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, no: benzophenone is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The molecule is symmetrical around the ketone group. So, the central carbon is the ketone, but it's double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. Also, the molecule is symmetric from the two phenyl groups. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, benzophenone does not have optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH-COOCH3 and CH2=CH-COOCH3, but in trans configuration around the double bond. Wait, no: fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3 but in trans. So, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and another CH2=CH-COOCH3? No, wait. Fumarate is the di-ester, so it's (E)-butenedioic acid's di-ester. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which has the structure HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate would be OMe groups on each end. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3) and another CH2=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid, so the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that's not right. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck, but the key point is that fumarate has a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate is an ester with a double bond, making it a di-ester with double bond geometry. Now, when you have double bonds, you can have geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but does that lead to optical isomerism? Well, geometric isomerism is about the arrangement around the double bond, but optical isomerism is about chirality. Wait, if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomerism. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and CH2=CH-COOCH3, but in trans configuration. Wait, no, fumarate is (E), so the substituents on each side of the double bond are opposite. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each end is a methyl ester of a carboxylic acid attached to each carbon of the double bond. So, each end is OMe and a CH2. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be. Or perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and another CH2=CH-COOCH3, but connected across the double bond. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group? No, wait, perhaps each has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, the formula of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but when it's the (E) isomer, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in the di-ester, each COOH becomes a COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 and another CH2=CH-COOCH3, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a another group. Let me think: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. Oh wait, in the case of fumarate, each of the two middle carbons (in the butenedioate) is connected to two ester groups. So, for dimethyl fumarate, each of the two middle carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond between them. So, each has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each of those two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups and two single bonds to other carbons. Wait, but that can't be, because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, that's not possible because each CH2 would have three bonds. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Because if it does, it can show optical isomerism.

Wait, each of the two central carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. But wait, if the groups are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. For example, each carbon is connected to two identical groups, so symmetry might prevent chirality. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, maybe a chiral center exists. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, then each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, for each of those carbons, are there four different groups? Let's see: the groups are COOCH3 (twice?), the double bond (which is a different group?), and a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me take one carbon in the double bond. It has two COOCH3 groups attached, a double bond to the other carbon, and a single bond to a CH2 group. So, the substituents are: two COOCH3, a double bond (which is a different type of bond, but in terms of substituents, perhaps it's considered as a sp² hybrid and connected to another group), and a CH2. Wait, but the two COOCH3 are identical. So, that carbon is attached to two identical groups (two COOCH3), a CH2, and a double bond. So, the groups are not all different. Therefore, that carbon isn't a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought maybe it could have geometric isomerism (cis vs trans). But the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of another diastereomer but without a chiral center. So, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of another approach. Wait, another option is that if the molecule has a center of inversion, it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is as follows: it's the diester of fumaric acid with methanol. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
     || 
     O

But wait, wait, the correct structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH for fumaric acid? No, that's for succinic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when you esterify both carboxylic acids with methanol, you get OMe groups on each. So, the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two CH2 groups (wait, no, it's CH2=CH, each attached to a COOCH3 group). So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3), a double bond to the other carbon, and a CH2 group. So, each has two same groups, so not a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but now I'm getting confused because I thought fumarate is related to maleate, which is the cis isomer. Maleate, when esterified, becomes dimethyl maleate, which has a chiral center. Wait, no. Wait, no, because if you have a double bond with two different groups on each carbon, then perhaps the configuration could lead to a chiral center. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, let's think about maleic acid. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. When esterified, it becomes dimethyl maleate. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but with the ester groups on the same side of the double bond. Now, each of the two central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. Since the substituents on each carbon are two COOCH3 groups, same groups, so each carbon isn't a chiral center. So, even dimethyl maleate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate, being a di-ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer, also would not have any chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: sometimes, when a molecule has a double bond, if the substituents on each end are such that there's a possibility of E and Z isomerism, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any optical isomerism, but I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, another possibility: what if the structure of dimethyl fumarate has a bridge or a ring which allows for a chiral center? No, I think not. So, given that, maybe option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, going back to the options:

Options are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the question is which of these show optical isomerism.

From earlier analysis:

2. has a chiral center (the central carbon with OH, COOCH3, and two different CH2 groups?), so it does.

1. The biphenyl compound: I thought initially it might have axial chirality, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Axial chirality arises when a molecule has a central axis around which substituents are arranged asymmetrically. Biphenyl compounds can have this if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,1'-biphenyl derivatives, if the substituents are in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit axial chirality. So, for option 1, substituents are at 6,6' (nitro) and 2,2' (carboxylate). So, each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. Now, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the biphenyl axis. So, when the two rings are connected, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to a plane of symmetry and no axial chirality. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So, option 1 doesn't have it.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

Looking back at the given options, the choices are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → but 1 and 4 don't have it.

B) 3 and 4 → no, neither has it.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't have it.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 doesn't have it.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I thought only option 2 has it. So, the correct answer is only option 2. So, looking back at the choices, which one includes only option 2?

Wait, the options are:

A)1,2,4 → all three have isomerism.

But from analysis, only 2 is correct.

Wait, but the given options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine my analysis.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. I thought it didn't have a chiral center. But perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 on either side. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each of those carbons has:

- Two COOCH3 groups (same substituents)

- A double bond to the other carbon.

- And two H's? No, wait, the structure can't have two H's because that would require four bonds. Oh wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon in the double bond has the structure R2C=CR2, where R is COOCH3. So, in this case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and another CH. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two single bonds to other groups. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Does the fumarate ester have any chiral centers? I think not, since each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups. So, no chiral centers.

So, the only correct one is option 2. So, looking at the options, the correct answer must be option 2. But looking at the choices, none of the options except option A includes 2 and 4, and option 2. But I thought 4 doesn't have optical isomerism. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. Another approach: the structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, in the ester, each of the two central carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. But wait, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups on one side and a double bond on the other. So, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups and two other substituents. Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two hydrogen atoms. If that's the case, then each carbon would be CH2 groups, but that's not possible with a double bond. No, the structure must be CH2=C(COOCH3)2, which is impossible because each carbon would have three substituents plus the double bond. No, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, which would imply that each CH has two COOCH3 groups. But that would make each CH have two identical substituents. So, each carbon is attached to two COOCH3, a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, again, two same substituents, so no chiral center.

So, no, I think option 4 doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of cis and trans isomerism? That's geometric isomerism, not optical. Optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center. So, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism.

So, now I'm confident that only option 2 shows optical isomerism. So, the correct answer is whether any of the options have option 2 as one of them. Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 don't have it.

B)3 and4 → no.

C)2 and3 → 3 doesn't have it.

D)1 and2 → 1 doesn't have it.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. Hmm. Did I miss any other compound?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option 1. Let's go back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 2 on each ring. Let me visualize the biphenyl structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carbonyl group (from the ester) at position 2. Since the biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1', the substituents are in the 6 and 2 positions. Now, when you have substituents in such positions, can the molecule have axial chirality? Axial chirality occurs when the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical around the central axis. For example, in binaphthyl compounds, substituents on each ring can lead to axial chirality if they are in positions that don't mirror each other.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Let me number the positions. On each benzene ring, position 1 is where the biphenyl is attached. Then, position 2 is adjacent to 1. So, 6 is the position opposite to 1. Wait, in benzene, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So, position 6 is across from position 1. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 6 (nitro) and 2 (carboxylate ester). So, each ring has a nitro at 6, which is opposite the point where it's attached to the other ring, and a carboxylate at 2, which is adjacent to the attachment point. So, when you look at the biphenyl, each ring has the same substituents: nitro opposite the junction and carboxylate at the adjacent position.

Now, does this arrangement lead to a plane of symmetry? If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the mirror image is the same, then no axial chirality. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then axial chirality exists.

In this structure, the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, if you mirror the structure, the positions would swap, but since they're symmetrical on both rings, the molecule would be superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it wouldn't have axial chirality. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each of the two CH groups has two COOCH3 groups attached, a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, each of the CH groups would have two identical substituents (COOCH3), a double bond, and a CH2 group. So, it's CH2-C(COOCH3)2=CH2. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH2. No, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers because each substituent on the double bond is symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a double bond doesn't necessarily imply chirality. For example, ethene has no chirality. So, dimethyl fumarate, which has a double bond, doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. The only one showing optical isomerism is option 2. But looking at the options given:

The options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, but none of these options have only option 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it can have axial chirality. For example, in 1,1'-binaphthyl derivatives, substituents in certain positions lead to axial chirality. In this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Now, the 6 position is across from the point where the two rings are connected. So, on each ring, the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other are the same on both rings. Therefore, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same position relative to the connecting axis, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, thus not chiral. So, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, is there any other option left? Option 2 is the only one that has a chiral center. So, the correct answer should be option 2 only. But looking back at the original question, the options are:

A) 1,2 and4
B)3 and4
C)2 and3
D)1 and2

None of these options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Maybe if the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: the molecule dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,2-dimethylbut-2-enoate or something similar. No, perhaps it's the di-ester of fumaric acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=CH-C-OCH3
   /
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Esterifying both COOH groups with methanol gives OMe groups, so OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. So, the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Now, each of the two central CH groups (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two OMe groups. So, each CH has two OMe (same substituents), a double bond, and a CH group. So, each CH is attached to two identical groups (two OMe), a double bond, and another CH. So, each CH is not a chiral center because it has two identical substituents. Therefore, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: could there be another chiral center elsewhere in the molecule? For example, in the ester groups. The ester groups are OMe attached to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is attached to the central CH. So, perhaps the ester group is OMe-O-C-O-..., but I don't think that creates a chiral center.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let's think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. Suppose the structure is such that each of the two central carbons in the double bond has two different substituents. For example, one carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other has another substituent. Wait, no, because in fumarate, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (COOCH3). So, no, that doesn't create a chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Another way is to look for the presence of a chiral center in the given structures.

So, the only structure that has a chiral center is option 2.

Now, looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). But I've concluded that 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, so option D includes 1, which is incorrect. So, none of the options have only 2, which suggests I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think differently. If dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on the same side of the double bond (cis), does that create a chiral center? No, because each substituent is the same. Wait, but wait: what if the ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), as in fumarate? Then, perhaps each of the two central carbons has two ester groups, which are same, so no chiral center.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in that case, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm convinced that only option 2 has a chiral center and thus optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, I must have missed something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again: if the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically, could the biphenyl have axial chirality?

In option 1, each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central axis. So, the molecule would be symmetrical, thus not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is option 2. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). But I've determined that 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, so option D is incorrect as well. Hmm. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think about dimethyl fumarate again. If the structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, could that lead to any chiral centers? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can exhibit some kind of stereoisomerism beyond optical, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely wrong about option 2. Let me re-examine option 2.

Option 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the one attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH group. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. No, wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)

- OH

- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)

- and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it out step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that's the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon is the second carbon, which is CH2. It's connected to:

- HO-

- CH2-

- COOCH3

- and a H? No, wait, each CH2 has two H's. Wait, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- HO-

- two CH2 groups,

- and a COOCH3 group? No, that's not correct. The structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second CH2) is connected to:

- an OH group,

- a CH2 group on one side (leading to the first CH2),

- a CH2 group on the other side (leading to the COOCH3),

Wait, no, that's not possible because each CH2 has two bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Which would be the structure where the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (the one from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but that would make the central carbon a chiral center because it's connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the next group). So, in this case, the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. Therefore, option 2 does have optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is option 2.

But looking back at the options, none of the options have only option 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, which includes options 1,2,4. But I've already determined that 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about option 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that one of the carbons has four different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon is CH2, which is not a chiral center. But if the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH2, then the carbons would have different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral center? If not, then option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Since only option 2 has optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2, I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. Maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the biphenyl has axial chirality.

If each ring has substituents at 6 and 2, then when looking at the two rings, the nitro and carboxylate groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the two rings to be non-superimposable mirror images, then the molecule would exhibit axial chirality.

But in this case, both rings have the same substituents in the same relative positions. So, the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it doesn't have axial chirality.

So, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

That leaves me with option 2 as the only correct answer. But the options don't include an option that only includes 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm confident that 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2 and4, but I think that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Another approach: looking up the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Upon checking, dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each of the two central carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is 2. Therefore, the answer must be option 2. But looking at the given options, the only one including 2 is option A and D. But option A also includes 1 and 4, which are incorrect. Option D includes 1 and 2, but I think 1 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think again. Could the biphenyl have axial chirality? For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, when you look at the two rings, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. So, it would have axial chirality.

Wait, let me visualize the structure. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Now, considering the arrangement, the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not mirrored, leading to a lack of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule could have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. If option 1 has axial chirality, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, options 1 and 2 would both have optical isomerism. Looking back at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, the correct answer would be D.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier, I thought option 1 didn't have axial chirality because the substituents were symmetrical, but now I'm thinking it does because the arrangement creates a chiral axis.

So, perhaps option 1 does have optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option D) 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up axial chirality in biphenyl compounds.

Upon reflection, axial chirality occurs when the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. In this case, if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. However, if the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other, then no symmetry exists, leading to axial chirality.

In option 1, each ring has substituents at 6 and 2, which are the same positions, leading to a symmetrical arrangement. So, option 1 doesn't have axial chirality.

Therefore, the only correct answer is option 2. But again, the options don't include an option that only includes 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center elsewhere? For example, perhaps if the ester groups are attached to a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to diastereomers, but that's not relevant for optical isomerism.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct answer is option 2. Therefore, the only correct option is option 2, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I can't see how 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think of the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each of the two CH groups has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, each CH has two same substituents, so no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is option 2. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4, and it does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that one of the carbons has four different substituents. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2CH3, but that's not correct for fumarate. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the two carbons in the double bond has two different substituents.

Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each CH is CH2, which is not a chiral center.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only option 2 has a chiral center and thus optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer must be an option that includes only 2. But the given options don't include that. Perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I think I need to conclude based on my analysis. Only option 2 shows optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option 2. But since the options don't include an option with only 2, I'm forced to choose the closest option, which is option D) 1 and 2, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 1. Let me think once more. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the two rings are mirror images, then the molecule would be symmetrical and not chiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral.

In option 1, each ring has substituents at 6 and 2, which are the same positions. So, when you mirror the molecule along the axis connecting the two rings, the substituents on each ring would swap positions, but since they're in the same relative positions, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no axial chirality.

So, I'm confident that only option 2 has optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is option 2.

But since the options don't include an option with only 2, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the best possible answer.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct answer is option 2, so the correct option is the one that includes 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 2, but I think 1 and 4 are incorrect. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and I must choose option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the only way this makes sense is if I made a mistake with option 4. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think of the structure again. If the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, each CH has two COOCH3 groups, so same substituents, thus no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I can't confirm.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option 2, so the correct option is the one that includes 2. The only option that includes 2 is option A and D. But I think option D is 1 and 2, which I think 1 is incorrect.

So, I'm forced to choose option 2, but the options don't have it. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I don't think so.

But I think the correct answer is option 2. So, I'll select option 2 as the correct answer, but it's not among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in another way. Let me list the structures and whether they have optical isomerism.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → No, because substituents are symmetrical.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → Yes, chiral center.

3. benzophenone → No.

4. dimethyl fumarate → No.

So, the correct answer is option 2 only. But the given options don't have an option with only 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I must choose the closest option.

Looking again, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2.

B)3,4 → no.

C)2,3 → includes 2 but 3 is incorrect.

D)1,2 → includes 2 but 1 is incorrect.

So, the only correct option is 2, but the options don't have it. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option 2, but the options don't include it, which can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioate, then each of the two carbons in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups attached, making them non-chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2. So, since the options don't have it, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

But I think I have to proceed with the conclusion that only option 2 is correct. But given the options, the correct answer must be option 2, so the only way is that the correct option is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1, and it does have axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. Suppose that the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, leading to a chiral axis.

In that case, option 1 would have axial chirality and thus optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then options 1 and 2 would have optical isomerism, making option D) 1 and 2 the correct answer.

So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and option 1 does have optical isomerism.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option D) 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality:

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate groups at positions 2 on each ring. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, resulting in a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit axial chirality or optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to four different groups: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl (CH3), a carbonyl (COOCH3), and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two identical phenyl groups, making it symmetrical. There are no chiral centers, so benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and a CH2 group. Since the substituents on each carbon are not all different, there are no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Only **Option 2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other options (1, 3, or 4) have chiral centers or axial chirality. However, based on the given choices, the closest answer is **Option D (1 and 2)**, assuming a potential error in the analysis of Option 1.

Answer: D
