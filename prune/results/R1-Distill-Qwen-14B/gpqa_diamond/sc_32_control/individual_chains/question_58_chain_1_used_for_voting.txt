Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what each option is about.

The question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization when dealing with high energies. Regularization usually comes into play when dealing with divergences in calculations, right? Like in quantum field theories where you get infinite results, so you regularize them to make sense of the math before renormalizing.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. Since it's a theory that incorporates higher dimensions and is supposed to be a quantum theory of gravity, I think it might not have the same issues as other quantum field theories. Wait, but waitâ€”string theory still involves quantizing things, so maybe it does require regularization? Or perhaps because it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences? Not sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave as free particles at high energies. But does that mean it needs regularization? Well, QCD calculations can have divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So I think they do use regularization methods, like lattice QCD or maybe other schemes. So B might require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has been very successful and that it does require renormalization because of things like the electron's self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These lead to divergent integrals, so you need to regularize them. So C definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical theory, not the quantum version. Classical theories don't deal with the same issues of divergences because they aren't quantized. So in classical E&M, you don't have the same infinities. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges which have issues, but in classical treatment, maybe you just accept that as a limitation, or use distributions. But as a theory, classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it doesn't involve the same divergent loop integrals as quantum theories. So D probably doesn't need regularization.

Wait, but wait. The question is about high energies. For classical theories, do high energies change anything? I think that at high energies, quantum effects become important, but the theory itself is classical. So maybe the issue here is about the theory's mathematical treatment regardless of energy scales. So classical ED wouldn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Putting it all together: the only theory that doesn't require regularization is D, classical electrodynamics. Because the other options are quantum theories that deal with divergences, needing regularization. So the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that incorporates higher dimensions and is a candidate for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. While it deals with quantized strings, it still involves divergences in calculations, so regularization is often required.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD describes the strong interaction and is known for asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave as free particles at high energies. However, QCD calculations, especially loop diagrams, can lead to divergences, necessitating regularization techniques like lattice QCD.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism and has been highly successful. It requires renormalization due to divergences in loop integrals, such as electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. Regularization is therefore essential in QED.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is the non-quantum theory of electromagnetism. It does not involve the divergences characteristic of quantum field theories, as it is not quantized. While classical theories have limitations, such as issues with point charges, they do not require regularization in the same way quantum theories do.

Since classical electrodynamics is not a quantum theory and does not involve divergences that require regularization, it is the correct answer.
