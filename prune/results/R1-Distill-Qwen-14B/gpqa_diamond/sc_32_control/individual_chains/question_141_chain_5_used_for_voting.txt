Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I think I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base. Wait, isn't that something used for deprotonation? Oh right, in aromatic substitution reactions, NaNH2 is often used as a base, especially when we're dealing with dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, I think that might be a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because sometimes, in such questions, the substituents are in specific positions. So 1 and 2 would be adjacent positions on the benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's para-bromodimethylaminobenzene? Wait no, 1 and 2 would be meta? No, wait in benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the substituents are in the ortho positions.

Wait, but wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' stands for something else. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? That would make sense. Because sometimes, when letters are used, they denote substituents. Like 'd' could stand for dimethylamino, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but that doesn't ring a bell as much. Alternatively, perhaps 'd' is a deuterium? But that seems less likely. Alternatively, the 'd' might be a typo, and the actual compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Assuming that, the structure would be a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at position 2. So it's an o-dimethylaminobromobenzene.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. What's the typical reaction when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base like NaNH2? I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, like a ring expansion or elimination.

Wait, another possibility: in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 can sometimes abstract a proton to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which can then attack an electrophilic site. Wait, but wait, in this case, perhaps it's more about elimination. Because if the ring has an activating group, like an amine, which is a strong activating group, maybe the bromide leaves, and a double bond forms.

Wait, another thought: if we have a bromine attached to the ring with a strong activating group, like -NMe2, which is a strong activating (electron donating) group, then perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond between the two substituents. So the Br is at position 1 and the NMe2 is at position 2. So when the base abstracts a proton, perhaps adjacent to the Br, leading to the elimination of H and Br, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system, so adding a double bond would create a cyclohexadiene structure? Or maybe the ring becomes a dienyl system?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But wait, in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 is often used for elimination rather than substitution because the leaving group (like Br) is on the ring, and the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, which could then undergo various reactions.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the substituents are o-substituted. The base is NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a deprotonating agent and a strong base.

In such conditions, I recall that when a benzene ring has a leaving group (like Br) and a strong activating group (like -NMe2), the base can abstract a proton alpha to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond (a dehydrohalogenation). This would form a di-substituted benzene with a double bond between the two substituents.

Wait, but wait, the benzene is already a conjugated diene? No, the ring itself is a conjugated system, but adding another double bond would change the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, then elimination of H and Br would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, the ring is already a six-membered ring with all single bonds in the ring. So, if we eliminate H and Br, the ring would form a double bond, making it a 1,2-diene? Or maybe the ring would become a cyclohexadiene, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But under such strong basic conditions, substitution reactions (like SNAr) usually require a good leaving group and a ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups to activate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but here the ring has an electron-donating group (NMe2), which activates the ring more for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So maybe substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could attack something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a ring expansion via elimination. Let me visualize the structure. The Br is on carbon 1, and the dimethylamino group is on carbon 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from carbon 3, then we're in a position where elimination of H and Br occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, and the ring becomes a bicyclic structure? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a quinonoid structure. Wait, when a benzene ring has adjacent leaving groups and activating groups, elimination can form a quinone structure, which is a conjugated diene with ketone groups. But in this case, we don't have carbonyl groups, but perhaps the elimination could form a conjugated diene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific reaction. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, it will abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine.

Which protons are adjacent? The ring has positions 1 (Br), 2 (NMe2), and positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to Br. Wait, no. Let me number the ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is NMe2. So positions adjacent to Br are 2 (but that's NMe2), 6, and maybe 3 and 5? Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for C1 (Br), the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 already has NMe2, so the base can abstract a proton from either C6 or perhaps C3, but wait, C3 isn't adjacent to Br. No, wait, the structure is benzene, so each carbon is connected to two others. So for C1 (Br), the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is already substituted with NMe2, so the base can abstract a proton from C6 or maybe from another position that's near.

Wait, but the NMe2 is on C2. So the ring is:

C1: Br
C2: NMe2
C3: H
C4: H
C5: H
C6: H

Wait, but when looking for protons adjacent to Br, it's C2 and C6. But C2 has NMe2, so the H on C6 is adjacent to Br. So the base (NaNH2) would deprotonate C6, which is adjacent to Br. That would form a carbanion on C6. Then, the Br would leave as Br- with the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think in terms of mechanism. The base abstracts a proton alpha to the bromine. So the H is on C6 (since C2 is occupied by NMe2). Then, when the H is removed, the adjacent Br leaves, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would make a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6. But then, the ring would have to adjust its structure, perhaps leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and another double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds. So maybe it's a matter of where the new double bond forms. Alternatively, perhaps the ring will form a conjugated diene structure, leading to a 1,3-diene on the ring. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, when the H on C6 is abstracted, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in such eliminations, the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted H are on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two carbons. So in this case, C1 and C6 would form a double bond. But since the ring is already a conjugated system, adding another double bond would create a new structure.

Wait, but if the ring is a benzene, which is a planar, fully conjugated ring, adding another double bond would disrupt that. Oh, perhaps the ring becomes a bicyclic compound? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is reforming as a different structure.

Wait, another angle: when the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, which is on C6, then elimination of HBr occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the ring is already a six-membered ring, does that form a cyclohexene structure? But that doesn't make sense because the ring is aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is formed between C1 and C2, but C2 already has a substituent (NMe2). So that's not possible. Wait, no, the substituent is at C2, but the double bond would be between C1 and C2, which are adjacent, but that would make the substituent on a double bond.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction again. NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's when you have arenes and ammonia under specific conditions. Alternatively, in some elimination reactions, like forming phenanthrene from toluene derivatives.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a diradical or some kind of cycloaddition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about substitution. But wait, in aromatic substitution, if the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution, which it would be with the NMe2 group, but under basic conditions, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base isn't doing substitution but deprotonating to form a benzene anion, which could then undergo some cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an Ullmann-type coupling, but that usually requires a copper catalyst and high temperatures, and I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, wait! I think I'm mixing up reactions. Let me get back to the basics.

The starting material is o-bromo-N,N-dimethylaminobenzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a deprotonating agent. The positions are 1 (Br) and 2 (NMe2). The base will abstract a proton that's adjacent to the Br, which can only be at position 6 (since position 2 is already substituted). So the base abstracts the proton at position 6, leading to the formation of a carbanion at 6 and the elimination of Br-.

Wait, but how does that proceed? The carbanion at C6 and the leaving group (Br-) would lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But then, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and since the ring is already a conjugated system, perhaps this leads to a new structure. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three conjugated double bonds. Adding another double bond would require some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the ring isn't six-membered anymore. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens up, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring. Let me think about the structure after elimination. If the Br is eliminated along with a proton from position 6, the double bond would be between C1 and C6. But the ring is still six-membered, just with a new double bond. Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds, so adding another would require removing an existing one. But that's not possible. So perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexa-1,3-diene or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a quinone structure. But in this case, the substituents are Br and NMe2, not ketones. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure would become a di- substituted benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6, making it 1,6-diene, but that doesn't make much sense in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexene with a substituent. But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, then elimination of Br would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But looking at the ring, that would make the ring have double bonds at positions 1-2 (existing), 3-4 (existing), and 5-6 (existing?), but that's not exactly how benzene's structure works. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new double bond between C1 and C2, but that's where the NMe2 group is. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe it's more about the formation of a benzene ring with a single double bond. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new aromatic compound. Wait, let's think about the positions again.

If the Br is at C1 and NMe2 at C2, and the base abstracts a proton at C3, which is adjacent to C2 (NMe2), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the H's adjacent to Br are C2 and C6. So the base can only abstract from C6, because C2 is already substituted.

So after elimination, the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the NMe2 group at C2. But how would that look? The ring would have double bonds at 1-2 (existing), and 5-6 (from elimination), but wait, that might interfere with the existing double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a 1,3-cyclohexadiene structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's part of a conjugated diene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. The reaction leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, in that case, the substituent would be between the two carbons with the double bond. That would lead to the NMe2 group being adjacent to a double bond.

But wait, in that case, the structure would be something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-Br, but that's a different situation. No, in the benzene ring, it's:

C1: Br

C2: NMe2

After elimination, the Br and H from C6 are removed, forming a double bond between C1 and C6, making the ring have a new double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about how many possible products there can be.

The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed in this reaction. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction leads to only one product, then the answer is B)1. But maybe there are multiple products if more than one elimination is possible.

Wait, in the starting material, the Br is at C1, and the NMe2 is at C2. So the only adjacent H that can be abstracted by the base is at C6. So the elimination would occur only once, leading to one product.

But wait, wait a second. What about the possibility of deprotonation at other positions? For example, maybe the base can abstract a proton from C3, which is meta to the Br. But I think that's less likely because the activating group (NMe2) directs the base to abstract protons that are ortho to itself.

Wait, the NMe2 group is at C2. So the activating group would direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. But in this case, the base is abstracting a proton, which is a base-catalyzed process. So perhaps the deprotonation occurs at positions ortho or para to the NMe2 group.

Wait, the NMe2 is at C2. So the ortho positions are C1 and C3. C1 has Br, so the base could abstract H from C3. Alternatively, the para position relative to C2 is C5.

Wait, but the Br is at C1, which is adjacent to C2 (the NMe2). So perhaps the base would abstract a proton from C3, which is ortho to NMe2. Then, elimination would occur between C1 and C3, but that's not adjacent. Wait, no, elimination requires the H and leaving group to be on adjacent carbons.

Ah, I see. So for elimination, the H must be on a carbon adjacent to the leaving group (Br). So the H must be either on C2 or C6.

But C2 has the NMe2 group, so H is not present there. Therefore, the only H available for elimination is on C6.

Therefore, the base can abstract only the H on C6. So only one site for elimination. Therefore, the reaction would produce only one product.

Wait, but can there be other pathways? Could the reaction proceed via a different mechanism, leading to more than one product?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from another position leading to a different product. But given that the only possible position for elimination is C6, perhaps there's only one product.

Wait, but wait another possibility: could the deprotonation and elimination lead to different regioisomers? Or is there another position where the double bond could form?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. The base abstracts H from C6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, this would create a new structure: the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, in addition to the existing double bonds.

But wait, the ring can't have more than three double bonds. So perhaps the existing double bonds reorganize. Maybe the ring becomes a naphthalene-like structure? Or maybe the ring opens and reforms as a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a di-substituted benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6, making it a 1,6-diene. But that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,2-diphenylethane, but that might not fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another angle: the reaction could be a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But under NaNH2 conditions, I'm not sure what would substitute Br. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a new substituent, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a diene. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, making it a 1,6-diene, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would require the NMe2 group to be on a double bond, which is possible, but then the structure would be a di-substituted alkene attached to the benzene ring. But would that be the case?

Wait, let me think again. If the base abstracts the H from C6, which is next to Br at C1, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, that would create a new double bond. But since the ring is already conjugated, the structure would adjust. So the ring would have double bonds at C1-C2 and C5-C6, and the new double bond at C1-C6? That doesn't make sense because the ring can't accommodate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexene with a substituent.

Wait, maybe the ring is not aromatic anymore. When the double bond forms, the ring could lose aromaticity, becoming a cyclohexene ring with substituents. But that's a big change, and I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a substituted styrene or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, leading to a structure that's 1,6-diene. But that's not possible in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes a ring expansion. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't eliminate but does something else. Like maybe the base deprotonates the ring, making it more reactive towards another substitution.

Wait, but I think the elimination is more likely. So, if the elimination leads to the formation of a new double bond, and that's the only possible product, then the number of products is one.

But wait, could there be multiple sites for elimination? Like, if the base abstracts a proton from another position, leading to a different product.

Wait, but I thought the only possible position for elimination is C6. Because the H must be adjacent to Br (C1), which are C2 and C6. C2 is occupied, so only C6 is available.

So, only one product would form, so the correct answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material could form more than one product due to different stereochemistry or regiochemistry. But in this case, I don't see how that would happen. The elimination would form a single product, as there's only one possible site for elimination.

Therefore, the answer should be B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically promotes dehydrohalogenation (elimination) by abstracting a proton adjacent to the leaving group (Br) and eliminating the leaving group to form a double bond.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, where bromine is at position 1 (C1) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) is at position 2 (C2). The benzene ring is planar, and the substituents are in the ortho positions.

2. **Mechanism of the Reaction**:  
   NaNH₂ acts as a strong base, abstracting a proton (H⁺) from a position adjacent to the bromine atom. In this case, the only available proton for elimination is at position 6 (C6), as position 2 (C2) is already occupied by the dimethylamino group. The elimination of H⁺ from C6 and Br⁻ from C1 results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   The elimination reaction leads to the formation of a single product: a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6. Since there is only one possible site for elimination (C6), no other products can form under these conditions.

4. **Elimination Pathway**:  
   The reaction proceeds via a straightforward dehydrohalogenation mechanism, resulting in a single organic product. There are no alternative pathways or additional sites for elimination, as the dimethylamino group at C2 does not provide another viable site for deprotonation and elimination.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces only one organic product due to the specific geometry and substituents of the starting material, which allow for only one possible elimination site. 

Answer: B
