Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. Let's break each reaction down.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. I recall that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, NaCN would add CN- to the carbonyl group. In the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because the addition of CN- to ketones usually happens under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, after the addition, maybe there's some kind of elimination or another reaction. Or perhaps it's a substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a cyanide nucleophile, it should add to the carbonyl. So, the first step would be the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon. But then, what happens next?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, wait, but the structure of butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN. But with substituents.

Wait, perhaps after adding NaCN, it's a substitution? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by an elimination. Or perhaps it's a substitution on the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the ketone is converted to a nitrile via a cyanohydrin formation. Oh, right! I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an addition product where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and water or another proton source provides the hydroxyl group.

So, the reaction would be: ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The conditions for this are usually an acidic aqueous solution. So, the reagent A would be something that provides H+ ions to help the reaction proceed. For example, H3O+ is a common acid catalyst.

So, for the first step, A is H3O+ (like in options A and B). So, that's one part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. So, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acidic or basic conditions, and often heat. But in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group, so I wonder if that affects the reaction.

Wait, the second reaction: the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. The reagent B is used along with H2O. So, what reagents are typically used for such a transformation?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. Acidic hydrolysis usually involves H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and heat, or perhaps other strong acids. Alternatively, basic conditions with something like NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

Looking at the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH.

Wait, in the options, the second reagent is B. So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is, for example, HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, I think a strong acid would be used. Like H2SO4, but in the options, the available B's are HCl or acetic acid.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile under basic conditions, followed by acid work-up. But in this case, the reagent B is H2O and another reagent.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B along with H2O. So, possible conditions are aqueous HCl or aqueous H3O+.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the nitrile is being converted to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid. But that would likely involve different reagents.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to the amide under acidic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done with a strong acid, like HCl, under reflux conditions. Alternatively, using a hydrochloric acid solution as the reagent.

Looking at the options, if B is HCl (option A and C), then that would fit. Alternatively, if it's acetic acid (option B and D), which is a weaker acid, maybe that wouldn't be sufficient for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but some sources say that nitriles can be hydrolyzed using aq. HCl and heat. So, if B is HCl, then that would make sense.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So, maybe the hydrolysis is facilitated under acidic conditions. For example, using HCl as the acid catalyst.

So, in that case, reagent B would be HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C also has B as HCl.

Wait, but the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, for the first part, if A is H3O+ (which is option A and B), then for the second part, B would be HCl (option A and C).

Wait, but looking back at the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the reaction is the formation of the cyanohydrin. That makes sense.

Then, for the second reaction, B is HCl, which would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together, option A would have A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, that's a cyanohydrin formation, which typically requires an acid catalyst, so H3O+ (option A and B) is correct.

Now, the second reaction: the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So, using HCl as B would provide the acidic conditions for hydrolysis.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done using H2O and HCl as the catalyst, perhaps under reflux. So, in that case, B would be HCl, which is present in option A.

So, option A would have A = H3O+ and B = HCl. So, that's a possible correct choice.

Alternatively, could it be that for the second reaction, the reagent is a different acid, like CH3COOH? Let me think about the conditions.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but in a way that requires a different acid.

Wait, another possibility: if the second reaction is an elimination followed by something else. No, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's a hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait, another approach. The second reaction could involve oxidation of the nitrile group. But nitriles are typically oxidized to amides or carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

Wait, oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in this case, the reagent B is given as H2O and another reagent.

Hmm, maybe it's hydrolysis, like I thought earlier.

Wait, another possibility: the nitrile could undergo hydrolysis to form an amide first, which then gets oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But that might require more steps and reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis in the presence of a mild acid. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a substitution where the nitrile is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but then oxidized further. Wait, but that's not the case here because the product is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O and another acid, like acetic acid.

Wait, but I think that the typical reagent for nitrile to carboxylic acid is HCl (aq) and heat. So, if B is HCl, then that's correct.

So, putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second, B is HCl. So, the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options given, option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ ions (since HSO4- is a weak acid). So, could A be NaHSO3 as well?

Wait, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. For that, you usually use an aqueous solution with HCN and an acid catalyst. So, for butan-2-one + NaCN, perhaps with H3O+ as the acid.

Alternatively, maybe in the first reaction, the acid could be something like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but in the options, the only available acids are H3O+ (which is like H+ from HCl or H2SO4) or acetic acid (CH3COOH).

Wait, but NaHSO3 would provide H+ as HSO3^- is a weak acid. So, perhaps it's possible that the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I know that in the cyanohydrin formation, the acid can be any proton source, like HCl, H2SO4, or perhaps even H3O+.

So, in the options, options A and C have B as HCl. So, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the correct option is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another way: the second reagent is B, which is either HCl or another acid. Let's look at the product of the second reaction. It's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group is still present, so perhaps the hydrolysis doesn't affect that position.

Wait, but how does the hydrolysis proceed? Nitrile (RCN) hydrolyzes to RCOOH under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, it's more likely to form the carboxylic acid directly, while in basic conditions, it might form the carboxylate, which is then acidified.

In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so if the reaction is under acidic conditions, then B would be HCl. But if it's under basic conditions, then after the reaction, it's acidified, but the reagent B might be something else.

Wait, but the reaction is written as: 2-hydroxy... + B (H2O) → product. So, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis where B is the acid, like aqueous HCl.

So, the second reaction uses HCl in water as the reagent. So, B is HCl.

So, in the options, options A and C have B as HCl.

Now, looking back at the first reaction: what is reagent A? The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN → cyanohydrin. So, the reagent A is the acid catalyst. So, which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B.

So, if A is H3O+, then the correct option would be A, if B is HCl.

Wait, but option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So, why would someone choose option C?

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. What is the role of reagent A in the first reaction?

Butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is:

(CH3)2CO + NaCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN

Wait, but that's the structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile at the end. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but that's not matching the product given. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the product.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, that would have five carbons. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN—so, four carbons including the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be pentanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. No, that would be 3-hydroxypropanenitrile. Maybe I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is described as butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a substitution of the ketone by the cyanide. But that doesn't quite make sense, as ketones don't typically substitute directly.

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that's for aldehydes and ketones under basic conditions. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the cyanide. But that usually requires specific conditions, like in the presence of a strong base, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN-.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be (CH3)2CNCN, which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imine or another addition product. Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That's a cyanohydrin, so that's correct.

So, the formation of a cyanohydrin requires an acid catalyst. So, reagent A would be an acid. So, H3O+ is a common choice. So, options A and B have A as H3O+.

So, for the second reaction, B is HCl (options A and C).

So, the correct option would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure about the second reaction. If B is HCl, then in the presence of water, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Yes, that's correct. So, the second reaction uses HCl and water as the reagents, which is option A.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1:  
**Reagents:** Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) adds to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone (butan-2-one), and the hydroxyl group (OH) is introduced. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction.

### Reaction 2:  
**Reagents:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, indicating that the reaction occurs under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - A = H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1 (cyanohydrin formation).  
  - B = HCl is correct for Reaction 2 (nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid).  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.  

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - A = H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1.  
  - B = CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and less suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - A = NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfate) is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺ and is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - B = HCl is correct for Reaction 2.  
  - This option is less favorable than Option A.  

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - A = NaHSO₃ is less suitable for Reaction 1.  
  - B = CH₃COOH is less suitable for Reaction 2.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion:  
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
