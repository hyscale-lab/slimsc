Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances in particle physics are unstable particles that exist for very short periods of time. They're kind of like excited states of other particles, right?

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson resonance. The given data includes the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). Hmm, okay, I think I need to calculate how far this meson travels before it decays.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, because the distance would be the speed multiplied by the time it lives. So the formula should be something like distance = c * τ, where τ is the lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the width Γ to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I should be careful about the exact relation. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's rest frame. So τ = ħ/(Γ), but I might have to check the exact formula.

So first, I'll need to calculate the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, I can find the distance by multiplying by the velocity of the meson, which I'll call v. But wait, v depends on the energy and mass of the meson.

But wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is probably moving at a relativistic speed. Oh, right, because E is much larger than m. So I should use relativistic equations here.

So the first step is to find τ, the mean lifetime. τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s, so I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me think about the values.

Hbar (ħ) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, that's a conversion factor I've heard before. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, that's 0.32 GeV. So I can write Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds? No, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Wait no, no exponents. Let me calculate 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 goes into 6.582 how many times? 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 20.56875. So yes, 20.56875 multiplied by 1e-25 s. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is the same as 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that seems right.

Now that I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the mean decay distance is v multiplied by τ.

But wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, but its rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So it's moving at a relativistic speed. To find the velocity, I think I need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

Wait, the total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (as in particle physics units), the formula simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

Wait, but E is given in GeV, m is in GeV/c² perhaps? Wait, units can be a bit tricky here. Maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I can always adjust the units when necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be found using beta = v/c, and beta is equal to (pc)/(E). Because in relativity, beta is p c / E. So beta = (p c) / E.

But I don't know p yet. Alternatively, from E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, so (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) → but I think in units where c=1, this would be p = sqrt(E² - m²). But since I'm working in GeV units, perhaps I can ignore the c factors for now, but I need to be careful with units when calculating velocity.

Wait, let me think again. Let me use the formula beta = v = (pc²) / E. Because in units where c is not 1, the momentum is p, and energy is E. So beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The meson is moving with energy E = 8 GeV, and mass m =1.2 GeV/c². So the kinetic energy is E - m c², but since E is much larger than m c² (since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV), the kinetic energy is approximately E.

But to find the velocity, I can use the relativistic formula for energy. Let me write:

E = gamma m c²,

where gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So gamma = E / (m c²). But E is given as 8 GeV, and m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Now, from gamma, I can find beta (v/c). The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma^2) → beta^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma²).

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)).

Plugging in gamma = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/(gamma²) ≈ 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

Thus, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's calculate that.

What is sqrt(0.9775)? Well, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9775) is a bit higher. Let me compute:

0.98^2 = 0.9604

0.989^2 = (0.98 + 0.009)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 = approx 0.9781.

Wait, 0.989^2 = approx 0.9781. But our value is 0.9775, which is a little less. So the square root is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me think of beta as sqrt(1 - 1/(400/9)) → sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

Compute sqrt(391): 19^2=361, 20^2=400. 391 is 361 +30= 19^2 +30 → sqrt(391)= approx 19.774.

So 19.774 /20 ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. So v ≈ c * beta ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, for precise calculations, maybe I should keep more decimal places, but perhaps it's okay for an approximate calculation.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ.

So I have τ as approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds, and v ≈ 0.9887 c.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.9887 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875:

0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875

0.06 * 2.056875 = 0.1234125

0.006 *2.056875= 0.01234125

Adding these: 1.8511875 + 0.1234125 = 1.9746, plus 0.01234125 = 1.98694125.

So total is 4.11375 +1.98694125 ≈ 6.10069.

So 6.10069e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.1e-16 m. But looking at the options, the closest is option C: 5.0223e-15 m, and option A is 5.0223e-16 m. Hmm, none exactly matches my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau, or in the velocity calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the tau.

Tau = hbar / Gamma.

Hbar in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is under 6.582. The difference is 0.182.

0.32 * 0.56875 = 0.182 (since 0.32 * 0.5 = 0.16, 0.32 *0.6875=0.2195; wait, no, maybe a better way is 0.32 * x = 0.182 → x = 0.182 / 0.32 ≈ 0.56875.

So 20.56875 → 20.56875 * 1e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that's correct.

Now, for the velocity, perhaps I should compute exact beta.

gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444.

So 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute more accurately.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) using a more precise method.

Let me think that sqrt(0.9775) = let's say x.

x = 0.9887 as I thought before, but perhaps compute more precisely.

Alternatively, using linear approximation around 0.98^2=0.9604.

Wait, 0.9887^2= approx 0.9775. Let me compute 0.9887^2.

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2 = 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So L = v * tau = 0.9887 * c * 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So 0.9887 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

As before, 2.966 *2.056875 ≈ 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options is 6e-16 m. Hmm. The options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, so my calculation is giving about 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, another approach: the relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma = 6.6666667.

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2)

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma^2) → 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400=391/400=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is what I had before. So that part is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the exact product again.

0.9887 * 3e8 → 0.9887 *3 = 2.9661 → 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 2.9661 *2.056875 = let me compute more accurately.

2.9661 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.9661 * 2.056875:

0.9661 * 2.056875.

Compute 0.9661 * 2 = 1.9322.

0.9661 * 0.056875 = let's compute 0.056875 * 0.9661.

0.05 *0.9661 = 0.048305.

0.006875 *0.9661 → 0.006632.

So total ≈ 0.048305 +0.006632 = 0.054937.

So 1.9322 + 0.054937 ≈ 1.987137.

So 0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.987137.

So total product is 4.11375 + 1.987137 = 6.100887.

So 6.100887e-16 m is about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for tau. Is tau = ħ / (Gamma), or is it something else?

Wait, Gamma is the total decay width. The relation between the width and lifetime is Γ = ħ/(tau).

Wait, no. Wait, the uncertainty principle says that the width Γ is related to the lifetime tau by Γ ≈ ħ / tau.

Wait, because the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So if the width is Γ, then Γ ≈ ħ / tau.

So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Yes, so my calculation was correct.

Hmm. So why are none of the options matching my result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the mean decay length is L = gamma * v * tau.

Wait, no, because tau is in the rest frame, and the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So perhaps I forgot to multiply by gamma.

Wait! Oh, right! Because the lifetime I calculated, tau, is the proper lifetime (in the particle's rest frame). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma.

So, the actual lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So, the mean decay distance is L = v * (gamma * tau).

Wait, that's a crucial point I think I missed earlier.

So let me redo the calculation.

So, correct formula is L = v * gamma * tau.

So, v is beta c, so:

L = beta c * gamma tau.

Alternatively, since gamma tau is the lab frame lifetime.

So, let me compute gamma * tau.

Gamma is 6.666667, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ ?

Compute 6.666667 * 2.056875:

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.666667 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute 0.666667 *2 =1.333334; 0.666667 *0.056875≈0.037916.

So total ≈1.333334 +0.037916=1.37125.

So 12.34125 +1.37125 =13.7125.

So gamma tau ≈ 13.7125e-24 s.

Now, L = v * gamma tau.

v is beta c = 0.9887 *3e8 m/s.

So,

L = (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * 13.7125e-24 s.

Compute:

0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 13.7125e-24 s:

2.9661e8 * 13.7125e-24 → 2.9661 *13.7125 → let's compute that.

2.9661 *13 = 38.5593.

2.9661 *0.7125 = 2.9661 * 0.7 = 2.07627, plus 2.9661 *0.0125=0.03707625 → total ≈2.113346.

So total is 38.5593 +2.113346 ≈40.672646.

So 40.672646e-16 m.

So, 4.0672646e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, which is very close to this value.

Hmm, wait, 4.067e-15 is option B.

Wait, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.

So the correct answer is B.

But wait, let me recheck the calculations to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.66666667.

Gamma * tau = 6.66666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

6.66666667 is 20/3.

So 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 e-24.

20 *2.056875 =41.1375.

41.1375 /3 =13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s.

v = beta c =0.9887 *3e8 =2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Multiply 2.9661e8 *13.7125e-24 = (2.9661 *13.7125) *1e-16.

Calculate 2.9661 *13.7125.

Let me compute accurately:

13.7125 * 2.9661:

Breakdown:

13 *2.9661 = 38.5593.

0.7125 *2.9661 = ?

0.7 *2.9661 =2.07627.

0.0125 *2.9661=0.03707625.

So 2.07627 +0.03707625=2.113346.

So total is 38.5593 +2.113346=40.672646.

So 40.672646e-16 meters =4.0672646e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute 2.9661 *13.7125.

Wait, another approach:

13.7125 * 2.9661 = ?

13 * 2 =26.

13 *0.9661=12.5593 → 26 +12.5593=38.5593.

0.7125 *2=1.425.

0.7125 *0.9661=0.687434.

So 1.425 +0.687434=2.112434.

Total 38.5593 +2.112434=40.671734 → 40.671734e-16 → 4.0671734e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

So perhaps this is due to using more precise values for beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 → (pc/c)^2 = E^2/(c^2) - m^2.

Wait, beta is (pc^2)/(E c^2). Wait, perhaps better to express beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, since E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by E^2: 1 = (p^2 c^2)/(E^2) + (m^2 c^4)/(E^2).

But beta = (pc)/(E) → (pc/E) = beta.

So beta^2 = (p^2 c^2)/(E^2) = (E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(E^2) → 1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2).

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, this becomes beta = sqrt(1 - m^2/E^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2 GeV)^2 / (8 GeV)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

But perhaps let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using a better approximation method.

We can note that 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769.

So 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769.

But our target is 0.9775.

So perhaps 0.9887 is almost exact.

So with beta=0.9887, the calculation proceeds as before.

So, the distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is option B.

So the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame, and \( v \) is its velocity. The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Relate \( \Gamma \) to \( \tau \)
The lifetime in the lab frame is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), which is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the production energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

Thus, the lab frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) (the ratio of velocity to the speed of light) by:

\[
v = \beta \cdot c
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The value of \( \beta \) is determined from the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.4444
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
