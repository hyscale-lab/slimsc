Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again and think about the reactions involved.

The first part of the question says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me start by figuring out what each reaction does.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and heating usually leads to elimination or substitution. Since it's dibromo, perhaps an E2 elimination is happening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, highly strained but in this case, maybe the bromines are in positions that would allow for a double bond formation upon elimination.

Wait, but KOH is a good nucleophile as well. Since it's heated with excess KOH, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. But adamantane is a very rigid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane... so if each bromine is on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but elimination would require the bromines to be anti, right? Because E2 requires the leaving groups to be on opposite sides. Are the two bromines on adjacent carbons in a trans arrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a dehydrohalogenation. Let me think. Heating with KOH could cause the two bromide groups to leave, and form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, but wait, I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond. Oh wait! The product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution leading to a ketone.

Wait, but wait. The IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests that product 1 is a ketone. So, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's undergoing a nucleophilic substitution. But since it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double substitution. Hmm.

Wait, wait. The IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. That could suggest either a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But in the presence of KOH, perhaps it's a ketone. So maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. However, if KOH is in excess, perhaps the OH groups are deprotonated to form an alkoxide, which could then eliminate or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but that would form a double bond, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait another thought. Maybe the reaction is a double substitution to form a ketone. But how? Dibromide to a ketone via substitution? That doesn't make sense directly. Oh wait, perhaps it's a peroxide effect, but I don't think so here. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but no, KOH is a strong base, not a reagent that would form Grignard.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So when heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would form 1,3-diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes elimination to form a ketone via some mechanism. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by an OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1-bromo-3-adamantanol (if one substitution occurs), but that wouldn't lead to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would form a diol. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data of product 1. The 1H NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm is likely an -OH group, but wait, in D2O it would be exchanged, but the question says to exclude those. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, but KOH is a base, maybe it's deprotonated. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or something else.

Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So what reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would give a ketone?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a elimination-addition. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, could it be that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then some further reaction forms a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the initial step is elimination to form a double bond, but that doesn't directly create a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, each bromide is replaced by an oxide bridge, leading to a ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario. Hofmann elimination occurs when a quaternary ammonium salt is treated with a strong base, leading to elimination of ammonia and forming an alkene. But that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a double E2 elimination. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, the base could abstract a proton leading to the formation of a double bond, but that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that involves esters and intramolecular elimination to form rings. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where one bromide is replaced by an oxide, leading to an alkoxide, which then eliminates a bromide. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, wait, another approach: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, each Br is replaced by an -OH group. Then, perhaps, the two -OH groups lose water to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but two -OH groups on adjacent carbons would form a carbonyl via elimination. So, it's a diol that forms a ketone.

Wait, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH gives 1,3-adamantanol diol. Then, under heat, the diol could lose two water molecules to form a ketone. But how?

Wait, diols can form ketones via oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is heated in a basic condition, leading to elimination. So, two -OH groups on adjacent carbons could lose two water molecules to form a carbonyl group. Let me visualize: imagine two adjacent -OH groups.

When two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons, under acidic or basic conditions, they can lose water and form a double bond. But wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, if the two -OH groups are on the same carbon, elimination would form an alkene. But if they're on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a carbonyl? Let me think. For example, glycol (ethylene glycol) when dehydrated under certain conditions forms ethylene, but that's not a ketone.

Wait, wait, perhaps the initial substitution leads to a geminal diol, which could eliminate water to form a carbonyl. So, if both Br atoms are on the same carbon, substitution would give a geminal diol, which upon elimination would form a ketone. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, which are bridgehead positions, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the reaction is that each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. But that’s a stretch.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a singlet. That might be an -OCH2O- group, but in that case, the IR would show two carbonyls (if it's a ketone or ester), but the IR here shows only one. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2CH2O- group, but then I don't see how that leads to a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't support that. Because diols don't have a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this first step. Let me try looking at the options again.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet. Maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, but then again, the IR would have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, which has a characteristic triplet around 3-4 ppm, but here it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the -OCH2- group is part of a ketone. Oh wait, if the product is a ketone, maybe it's a secondary alcohol that was dehydrated. Wait, but that would require a primary or secondary alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's not making sense.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a diol but a ketone where the carbonyl is in a certain position. Let me think, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination of two HBr molecules forms a double bond, and then further oxidation forms a ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by an O- group, which then abstracts a proton to form a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe that's possible.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, each Br is replaced by an -OH group, leading to a diol. Then, the diol is heated with a base, leading to the formation of a cyclic ether via elimination of water, but that would form an epoxide or a different ether, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes oxidation. But under KOH conditions, that's not likely. So maybe I'm going down the wrong path here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product 1's structure. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So the initial reaction must form a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. Hmm. Maybe it's an example of a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where both bromines are replaced, leading to a structure where the two oxygens are adjacent, forming a carbonyl. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, substitution could lead to two -O- groups attached to adjacent carbons. Then, perhaps the adjacent -O- groups could form a carbonyl through some mechanism. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe elimination of HBr occurs twice, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one Br is substituted by an -OH, and the other by something else. Wait, but with KOH as the base, I don't think another group would be introduced.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon treatment with KOH, a substitution occurs where one Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that still doesn't lead to a ketone.

Wait, maybe this is a case of the formation of a gem-diol. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on different carbons, so substitution would give diol on different carbons, not geminal.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps I should skip the first part and focus on the later steps, assuming that product 1 is a ketone.

Product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What's that reagent used for? Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps, product 1 is treated in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the starting material is adamantane, which is a polycyclic structure. So perhaps product 1 is an arene with a ketone group. Or perhaps the ketone is part of the adamantane framework.

Wait, but product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. So perhaps product 1 is 3,3-dimethyl-1-adamantanol? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexanone derivative. Wait, but adamantane is a four-ring structure, so not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone? No, because the starting material is di-bromo, and substitution would add two oxygen groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. So the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, probably sharp peak, indicative of a carbonyl group. So product 1 has a carbonyl. The NMR shows 2H at 4.79 ppm. Maybe that's an -OCH2- group adjacent to a carbonyl. Like in acetone, but that's a singlet. Wait, but that's just a guess.

Alternative approach: perhaps the first reaction forms a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first product is a cyclohexenone. Let's think: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could cause elimination to form a cyclohexene ring, but that would need two adjacent Br atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening and then ring-closing to form a ketone.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the other steps, maybe that helps.

Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolysed to form product 3.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else that can undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, but ozonolysis is typically used on alkenes to cleave them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must contain a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond that, when ozonolyzed, gives product 3. Ozonolysis of a double bond generally breaks it into two carbonyl groups, depending on the substituents.

So, how does product 1 become product 2 with a double bond?

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but I'm not sure how that would form a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with aluminum isopropoxide (which is a Lewis acid) could form some kind of cyclic ether, but that still doesn't add a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1's ketone is undergoing some kind of elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. So, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a ketone, and when heated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes an elimination reaction to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. So product 2 is an enone.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis of an enone would typically break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone) would do what? Ozonolysis of an enone (like cyclohexenone) typically gives a diketone, because the ozonide forms and upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide), it cleaves to form carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds, each with their own structure.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it a carbonyl-adjacent proton.

Wait, but in ozonolysis of an enone, the double bond is cleaved. So, the structure of product 3 would depend on where the double bond was in product 2.

Let me try to reconstruct the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone) via reaction with KOH.
2. Product 1 → product 2 (an α,β-unsaturated ketone) via elimination using aluminum isopropoxide.
3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me get back to product 1. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, product 1 must be a ketone. So, the starting material (1,3-dibromoadamantane) when treated with KOH forms a ketone. How?

Another approach: perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon treatment with KOH, it forms a gem-diol, which then forms a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane doesn't have adjacent Br atoms. So substitution would give a diol on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double SN2 substitution. Each Br is replaced by an -OH group, making a diol. Then, under heating with KOH, the diol undergoes elimination, losing two water molecules to form a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm, maybe the diol rearranges into a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not straightforward. Unless it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where one of the Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide or some other structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms ketones. But Baeyer-Villiger requires a ketone and an oxidizing agent, which KOH isn't.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on the first step. Maybe I should look for the answer without fully solving the first part. But that's risky.

Alternatively, perhaps the first product is a cyclopropane ketone. Wait, no, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a ketone where the carbonyl is at position 1 and 3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is transformed into a ketone via elimination. Let me think, perhaps when KOH is added, the two Br atoms are eliminated, and water is formed, but that's not making sense.

Wait, wait. In the first step, the product is a light yellow solid. That could be a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone.

Assuming that product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So, if product 1 is an arene, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something that forms a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an aromatic ketone. Then, in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation, adding an acyl group to the ring. But that would add a substituent, and I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 2 is then ozonolysed. Ozonolysis targets double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

So, perhaps product 2 is an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone), which is formed via elimination from product 1.

So, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would give product 3 as two carbonyl compounds.

Now, the question is, in product 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen? The most deshielded would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, in the ozonolysis of an enone, the double bond is cleaved, and two carbonyl groups are formed. So, if the enone was something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', after ozonolysis, it becomes R-CO and CH2-CO-R'.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of an enone (like CH2=CHCO) would cleave to give two carbonyls. For example, cyclohexenone would become two ketones upon ozonolysis.

But regardless, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

In such a case, the coupling would be with adjacent protons. For example, a CH2 next to a carbonyl would have two protons. Each of these protons would couple with neighboring protons. 

Wait, but in the case of CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, each CH2 proton is split by adjacent CH2 groups or other protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group next to a ketone. So, each of those two protons would be split by neighboring groups.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure like RCOCH2CH2CO R'. So, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded.

But how are the protons arranged? Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the enone is something like CH2=CHCOCH2CH3. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond to form two carbonyl groups: formaldehyde and another ketone.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of CH2=CHCOCH2CH3 would give CH3CO and HCHO (formaldehyde), but that's not correct because the structure isn't symmetric.

Wait, perhaps a better example: if the enone is CH2=CH-CO-R, then ozonolysis would cleave between the double bond carbons, giving two carbonyl compounds: R-CO and CH2(O). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone is part of a larger ring, and ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, I'm making this complicated. Let me think about the NMR of product 3.

The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange). The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

So, what kind of coupling would a proton adjacent to a carbonyl have?

If the proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton would couple with the two neighboring protons on the same CH2 and possibly with other adjacent groups.

Wait, for example, in CH2=CH2, the protons are split into triplets because each H couples with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But that's for ethylene.

In a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, say, a structure like RCOCH2CH2X, the CH2 protons would be adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to coupling.

Wait, but in that case, each H on the CH2 would have neighboring Hs. Let's say it's a CH2CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of the two Hs on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no. Each H on a CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and possibly two Hs on the next CH2. Wait, but that's for a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2(CO)CH2CH2X. The middle CH2 would have protons that are adjacent to two on each side, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the structure is RCOCH2CH2Y, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me think: for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, if it's CH2-CH2, then each H is split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would see two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each H is on a CH2, so each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (but those are equivalent, so it's a doublet), and also to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (also a doublet). So the splitting would be more complicated.

Wait, but each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have a coupling with two Hs, which would cause a triplet. Because each of the two neighboring Hs would split the signal into a doublet, and since there are two sets of two Hs, it becomes a triplet of triplets, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the two adjacent CH2 groups. Each H on a CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, each with J coupling, leading to a triplet.

Wait, for example, consider ethyl groups. The CH3CH2 group: the CH2 protons are split by the adjacent CH3, leading to a quartet. But in this case, it's two CH2 groups next to each other.

Wait, another example: in 1,2-dichloroethane, the CH2Cl2 structure, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Each H on the CH2 would couple with two H on the same CH2 (but same group, so they're equivalent, leading to a doublet), and also with two H on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two coupling partners, each with two Hs. Wait, no, each H is coupled to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, so each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, each H would have a triplet splitting pattern.

Wait, but wait, if each H on CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, then the splitting would be a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Therefore, its coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is treatment with KOH, which produces a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, suggesting that product 1 is a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports this conclusion, as the chemical shifts are consistent with a ketone structure.

In the second step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, leading to product 2. This step likely involves an elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone). The presence of a double bond in product 2 is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

In the third step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by treatment with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, producing product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby protons.

The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is determined by its interaction with neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, it will couple with the two protons on the same CH₂ group (resulting in a doublet) and the two protons on an adjacent CH₂ group (resulting in another doublet). This combination of couplings produces a triplet of triplets. However, the question specifies excluding exchangeable protons, and the most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, which would exhibit a triplet coupling pattern due to interactions with two neighboring protons.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A
