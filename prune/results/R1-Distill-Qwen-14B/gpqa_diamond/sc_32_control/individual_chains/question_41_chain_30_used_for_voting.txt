Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

The question: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, in this case, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with how velocities add in different reference frames. Like, how in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Wait, but we're dealing with a material medium, which is non-relativistic perhaps? Or maybe it's treated classically here.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v. So we can probably treat this using the Galilean addition of velocities, since v is presumably much less than c. Because if v is comparable to c, then we need to use special relativity, but the problem doesn't indicate that. So I'll proceed with the non-relativistic approach.

So, the light is moving through the glass. The glass itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the light's speed in the glass is c/n, but relative to the glass, right? Because the speed of light in the medium is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how do we find the speed in the lab frame?

In the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. So, the light is moving relative to the glass. Let me think: in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity). So when the glass is moving towards the observer at v, how does that affect the speed observed in the lab?

Wait, no. Wait. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion and towards the observer. Wait, actually, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, the light is moving towards the observer as well, but in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's imagine the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. From the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (because the beam is propagating in the direction the glass is moving, towards the observer). So, in the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, no. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. But the glass is moving at v toward the observer (so in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v). So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be u' = u + v, but wait, that's only if u and v are in the same direction.

But wait, no. Because u is in the same direction as v. So the lab frame would measure the speed as u + v? But wait, in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a medium moving, so maybe it's different.

Wait, no, that's a confusion between the medium and the speed of light in different frames. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is not just additive. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because even though v is much less than c, the problem is about the speed of light, which is a relativistic scenario.

Wait, but the problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1." So perhaps they are treating it with relativistic considerations. Let me think.

Wait, the relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The speed of the light in the glass is u = c/n in the glass's frame. So when transforming to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab), we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Let me get the directions correct. The lab is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, meaning in the same direction as the light beam. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n.

To find the speed in the lab frame, we need to perform a Lorentz transformation. But wait, the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction. So what's the observed speed in the lab?

Using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / [1 + (u v)/(c²)]

But u is c/n, so substituting:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c)

So,

u' = ( (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n) ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, but c is 1 in the problem statement. So simplify this.

Wait, c=1, so:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/(n) )

Hmm, let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

So numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u' = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Wait, that's interesting. So the speed observed in the lab is (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the velocity addition. Because I might have mixed up the frames.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab. The light is moving at u = c/n in the glass's frame, in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the speed is u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Wait, but wait, when you have a medium moving, the light's speed in that medium is c/n, but when transforming frames, it's the same as any other object. So the velocity addition applies.

But wait, another approach: when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the medium is still c/n. But the medium is moving, so the light's speed relative to the lab would be c/n + v? But that doesn't account for relativity, so that can't be right.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and it's independent of the medium's motion. But that's in the medium's frame. When the medium moves, the lab frame would see a different speed.

Hmm. But according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the source's motion. But in a medium, the speed is c/n, but when the medium is moving, that's a different scenario. So perhaps the velocity addition formula is correct here.

Wait, but in this case, the light is not in a vacuum. So how does that work? Maybe it's treated as a material medium, so their velocities add.

But according to the velocity addition formula, the observed speed is (u + v)/(1 + u v c^(-1) )

So when u is c/n and v is the velocity of the medium, then the observed u' is (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n) v )

Since c=1, it's (1/n + v ) / (1 + v/n )

Which is the same as (1 + n v) / (n + v ), as I found earlier.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light beam propagates through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \), so its speed in the glass's rest frame is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**
