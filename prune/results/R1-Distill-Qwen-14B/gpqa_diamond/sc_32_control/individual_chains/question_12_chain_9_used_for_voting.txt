Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu (a neutrino, I assume). The pion is at rest, so that should simplify things a bit. 

The rest masses are given as Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny masses, but in these kinds of problems, I think we usually neglect their rest mass and just consider them as massless. So the neutrino's rest mass is like zero for this purpose.

So the question is asking for the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = - p_nu. Or the magnitudes are equal and they move in opposite directions.

But wait, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, so their momentum would just be E_nu (since for massless particles, E = pc). The muon has some rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, maybe I'm getting units mixed up here. Let's see. Actually, in particle physics, energy and mass are often measured in MeV and MeV/c², and momentum in MeV/c. So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^4 + m_mu^4 c^8 )^(1/2) [Wait, no, more accurately, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²]. So that's the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

But since the pion is at rest, the total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. So:

E_pion = E_mu + E_nu

Which is 139.6 = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, momentum conservation says p_mu = p_nu (since the neutrino's momentum is opposite the muon's, but in magnitude they're equal). Wait no, the total momentum is zero, so the vectors add to zero. So p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_mu = - p_nu. But in terms of magnitudes, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But wait, neutrinos are nearly massless, so E_nu = p_nu c. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

Let me set p_mu = p, so p_nu = p as well, but in the opposite direction. So E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + (105.7 MeV)^2 c^4 ) / c^2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the units. Let me think in terms of MeV. The mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ) divided by c²? Or wait, perhaps we can ignore the c's since we're working in units where c=1? I think in particle physics, they often use natural units where c=1, so energy, mass, and momentum are in compatible units (like MeV, MeV/c², MeV/c). So maybe I should simplify by setting c=1.

So, with that, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV. And E_nu = p, since for a massless particle, E = p.

So the total energy equation is:

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6

Which is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let me call m = 105.7, E = 139.6.

So sqrt(p² + m²) = E - p

Square both sides:

p² + m² = (E - p)^2 = E² - 2 E p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

m² = E² - 2 E p

Rearranged:

2 E p = E² - m²

So p = (E² - m²)/(2 E)

Plugging in the numbers:

E = 139.6 MeV, m = 105.7 MeV

E² = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19488.16 (MeV)^2

m² = (105.7)^2 ≈ 11172.49 (MeV)^2

So E² - m² ≈ 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV)^2

Then, 2 E p = 8315.67 → 2 * 139.6 * p = 8315.67 → 279.2 p = 8315.67 → p ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me calculate that.

Hmm, 279.2 goes into 8315.67 how many times.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Wait, but 29 is too low because 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. So 29.8? Let me compute 29.8 * 279.2.

Wait, alternatively, 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's approximate. 279.2 is about 280.

8315.67 / 280 ≈ 29.7. So around 29.7 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.7 MeV/c.

So E_nu is p, so about 29.7 MeV.

Now, E_mu is E - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.7 = 109.9 MeV.

But wait, E_mu is the total energy of the muon, so the kinetic energy (KE) is E_mu - m_mu c². Since in natural units, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.9 - 105.7 = 4.2 MeV.

Wait, that's approximate. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute p exactly. Let me redo the calculation.

E = 139.6, m=105.7.

E² = 139.6² = let's compute 140² = 19600, but since it's 139.6, (139.6)^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m² = 105.7^2 = let me compute it:

105^2 = 11025. 

0.7^2 = 0.49.

Cross term 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147 → 147.0.

So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

E² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2 E p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Using calculator steps:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (since 279.2 * 30 is 8376, so 279.2 * 29 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8)

Subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 * x = 218.87 → x ≈ 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ about 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p ≈ 29.783 MeV.

E_mu = 139.6 - 29.783 ≈ 109.817 MeV.

So the muon's total energy is about 109.817 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.817 - 105.7 = 4.117 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is about 29.783 MeV, which would be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs or the setup.

Another thought: in the decay, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions, so their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which is why their magnitudes are the same. So the setup is correct.

Another thing to check: the sum of their energies equals the pion's rest energy, which is correct.

So the kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. So the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   where \(E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\), and \(E_\nu = p\) (since the neutrino is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay is zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = 139.6
\]

Let \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p
\]

Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2
\]

Cancel \(p^2\) and rearrange:  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
279.2p = 8315.67
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \(E_\nu = p\),  
   \[
   E_\nu \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = 139.6 - 29.783 \approx 109.817 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The total energy of the muon includes its rest energy. Thus, the kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.817 - 105.7 \approx 4.117 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Kinetic Energies:
- \(KE_{\mu^+} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\)
- \(KE_\nu \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\)

### Correct Option:
The closest match is **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).
