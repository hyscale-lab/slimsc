Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, what does that reaction typically look like?

Wait, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. Oh right! In aromatic substitution reactions, especially with halobenzenes, using a strong base can lead to dehydrohalogenation. So, when you have a bromine on a benzene ring and a strong base, it can abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond.

Wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or maybe "d" stands for something else. Oh, wait, in benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered. So 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene would have the bromine in position 1 and a dimethylamino group in position 2. So the structure is like a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a -N(CH3)2 group at position 2.

So when this reacts with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a deprotonating agent. The reaction is probably an elimination. In aromatic substitution, the base would abstract a hydrogen that's beta to the leaving group, which is bromine here. So, the H that's adjacent to the Br, but wait, in benzene, the positions are such that the adjacent carbons are ortho.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So the positions are 1, 2, 3, etc. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the Br is at position 1, and the substituent (maybe a methyl group or another substituent) is at position 2. Or wait, perhaps the "d" stands for something else, like a deuterium? No, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and "d" refers to another substituent, but perhaps in this context, the exact nature of "d" isn't crucial for the reaction outcome. Wait, the question says "1-bromobenzene-2-d"â€”maybe "d" is a substituent, perhaps a methyl group? Or maybe it's a deuterium, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo for "dimethylamino" or something else. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without getting too bogged down on that, but perhaps it's a substituent at position 2.

Wait, regardless, when NaNH2 is used with a halobenzene, it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the position where the leaving group was. Wait, but in aromatic compounds, can you form a double bond adjacent to the leaving group? Or perhaps it's a ring expansion or something else.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In aliphatic systems, like toluene derivatives, when you have a halogen and a hydrogen adjacent to it, a base can abstract that hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond (dehydrohalogenation, elimination reaction). But in aromatic systems, the ring is already conjugated. So perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkyne or a diene. Wait, but alkyne might be possible through dehydrohalogenation twice.

Wait, another possibility is that the bromine leaves, and the ring becomes more deprotonated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I don't think so because NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Wait, under strongly basic conditions, perhaps the mechanism is elimination, leading to the formation of a substituted benzene with a triple bond. But wait, benzene rings can't form triple bonds easily because they're already aromatic. Or maybe it's a case of forming a diradical? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a deuterium. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. But that seems unlikely to affect the reaction much. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-methyl benzene. If that's the case, then the structure would have a Br at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.

In any case, let's think about the reaction. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, it's likely to undergo elimination. So the Br would leave, and a hydrogen adjacent to it would be abstracted, forming a double bond.

Wait, but in benzene, the ring is already conjugated. How would this elimination work? Maybe the Br is at position 1, and the substituent (like a methyl group) is at position 2. So the positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. But if position 2 already has a substituent, then perhaps the base would abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between position 1 and 2.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the Br is at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. If position 2 has a substituent (like a methyl), then the H in position 6 is abstracted by the base. Then, when Br leaves, the double bond forms between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 already has a substituent, so perhaps the double bond would be between positions 1 and 6, but that's the same as between 6 and 1, which would be the same as between 1 and 6 in the ring.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Let's imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a substituent (let's say X) at position 2. The adjacent carbons to Br are positions 2 and 6. So the base would abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or 6. But if position 2 already has a substituent, perhaps the hydrogen is at position 6. So when the base abstracts that H, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6 (or between 6 and 1, which is the same as 1 and 6).

Wait, but in that case, the substituent at position 2 would be next to the double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and a substituent at position 2. That would give a structure like styrene but substituted.

Wait, but that would lead to a product where the substituent is at position 2, adjacent to the double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no, if the double bond is between 1 and 6, then position 2 is adjacent to position 1 but not to position 6. So the substituent would be at position 2, and the double bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then the double bond forms between positions 1 and 6. That would leave the substituent at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So the resulting structure would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and a substituent at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 3? Wait, no, the question says 1-bromo-2-d, so substituent at position 2.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, upon elimination, the product would be 1,6-didehydro-1-methylbenzene, which is a substituted benzene with a double bond between 1 and 6 and a methyl group at 2. But wait, if the double bond is between 1 and 6, then the other positions would have to adjust accordingly. Hmm.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So the ring would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and a substituent at position 2. So the structure would look like a benzene ring with substituents at 1 (double bond to 6) and 2 (methyl or whatever the substituent is). But wait, wait, if the double bond is between 1 and 6, that would create a ring with alternating double bonds, but benzene is already a fully conjugated ring. So how does that work?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by a double bond. For example, if the Br is at position 1, elimination would lead to a double bond between positions 1 and 2, turning the benzene into something like a styrene structure. But wait, that can't be possible because benzene is already a fully conjugated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group. Wait, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already fully conjugated. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is at a different position.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a benzene ring with two double bonds, but that's not possible as benzene is stable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not an elimination but dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond. But that's not feasible either because triple bonds are not typically formed in aromatic systems under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the general case. When a halobenzene (like bromobenzene) is treated with a strong base, such as NaNH2, in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it typically undergoes elimination to form a benzyne intermediate. Wait, benzyne! Oh right, that's a possibility. Benzyne is a benzene ring with a triple bond, a diradical, or a dienophile, something like that.

Wait, but how does that form? So, in the case of bromobenzene, when NaNH2 is used, the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzylide (a carbanion) adjacent to the leaving group. Wait, but in bromobenzene, the hydrogen adjacent to Br is at position 2 and 6. Deprotonation leads to the formation of a conjugated base, which then eliminates Br- as a leaving group, forming a triple bond between the deprotonated carbon and the Br's position.

Wait, so in bromobenzene, the elimination would form benzyne: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, no, benzyne is a benzene ring with a triple bond, but it's a highly strained and reactive species. But in our case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which may have a substituent at position 2.

Wait, so if the molecule is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, for example, then when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (adjacent to Br at 1), the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 already has a substituent (like dimethylamino). So the triple bond would be between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a substituent, so how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in the para position. No, in 1-bromo-2-d, the substituent is at position 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is such that upon elimination, the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, making the substituent part of the triple bond. But that doesn't seem possible because the substituent is a group attached to the ring, not part of the carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The reaction of bromobenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia typically leads to the formation of benzyne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond. But the presence of substituents can influence where the triple bond forms.

Wait, in this case, the substituent is at position 2. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, that's adjacent to Br at 1. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. Wait, but position 6 is already next to position 1, so the triple bond would be between 1 and 6.

Wait, but position 2 is adjacent to position 1. So substituents at position 2 would influence the possibility of forming the triple bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a directing group that affects where the triple bond forms. For example, if the substituent is an activating group, it might direct the elimination to a specific position.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the possible products. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the reaction forms a triple bond, then the substituent at position 2 would influence the possible positions of the triple bond.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, perhaps the triple bond can form either between 1 and 2 (ortho to substituent) or between 1 and 6 (meta to substituent). Wait, but position 6 is para to position 2.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So if the substituent is at position 2, the possible positions for the triple bond would be between 1 and 2 (ortho) or between 1 and 6 (meta to substituent, or para to substituent? Wait, position 6 is across from position 2 (since benzene is six-membered, position 2 and 6 are across from each other).

Wait, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So if the substituent is at position 2, adjacent to position 1, then elimination could form a triple bond between 1 and 2. But if the substituent is at position 2, that might affect whether the H is abstracted from position 6.

Wait, let me try to visualize this:

Positions:

1: Br

2: substituent (d)

3: H

4: H

5: H

6: H

So, when the base comes in, it would abstract a hydrogen adjacent to the Br. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6.

But position 2 already has a substituent (d), so perhaps the H is at position 6.

So, abstracting the H at position 6, then elimination occurs, and the Br leaves, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, with the substituent at position 2.

Wait, but a triple bond between 1 and 6 would make a benzene ring with a triple bond in a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a different structure.

Wait, but in any case, the question is about how many possible products are formed.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent at position 2 can influence the site of elimination. For example, if the substituent is electron-donating, it may activate certain positions for elimination.

Wait, but regardless, the main point is whether the elimination can occur in more than one position, leading to different products.

Wait, let's think: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-X benzene. The X is at position 2. The possible H's for elimination are at positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has X, so the H there might not be available (if X is bulky or if it's deuterium, which is less reactive, but that's speculative). Alternatively, perhaps the H at position 6 is the only one available for elimination.

Wait, if X is a deuterium, then perhaps the H at position 6 is abstracted, leading to elimination. So the product would be a triple bond between 1 and 6, and the deuterium at position 2. Alternatively, if X is something else, maybe the H at position 6 is the only one available.

Wait, but in some cases, steric hindrance or electronic factors could lead to different sites of elimination. Alternatively, maybe the substituent at position 2 directs where the elimination occurs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an activating group, like an amino group (if X is -NMe2), which would be ortho/para-directing. So, the elimination could occur at the para position relative to the substituent. Hmm, but in this case, the Br is at position 1, which is adjacent to substituent 2 (ortho position). Wait, but if the substituent is activating, would that influence the site of elimination?

Alternatively, maybe in the presence of a substituent, the elimination could occur in such a way that the substituent ends up in a certain position relative to the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in ammonia would produce a benzene ring with a triple bond. The substituent at position 2 would determine whether the triple bond can form in more than one position, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, then the triple bond could form either between 1 and 2 (ortho) or between 1 and 6 (para to substituent). Wait, but that would require elimination at position 6, which is para to substituent 2.

Wait, wait, let me number the benzene ring properly:

Positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 2 is next to 1 and 3. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4, and so on.

So substituent X is at position 2. Then, the adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is next to Br (position 1), then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But position 6 is across from position 2 (since 2 and 6 are opposite each other in a benzene ring). So the substituent X is at position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6, which is position 6, which is para to substituent X.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, but position 2 has substituent X. So if X is not deuterium, then perhaps the hydrogen at position 2 is not available, so elimination can only occur at position 6.

Wait, but if X is a substituent that has H's, like a methyl group, then the H at position 6 would be available for abstraction. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a single product.

But wait, if X is a substituent that's deactivating or bulky, perhaps it hinders the approach of the base to the H at position 6, but that's not necessarily the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at 2 can direct the elimination to occur in a way that produces different products. For example, if the substituent is an electron-donating group, it might activate certain positions for elimination.

Wait, but in any case, for the reaction 1-bromobenzene-2-d plus NaNH2, the product would be a benzene with a triple bond. How many possible positions can that triple bond form?

Wait, in bromobenzene, the triple bond can form in two positions: between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6. But in our case, position 2 has a substituent, which might influence where the triple bond forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's presence leads to only one possible site for the triple bond formation, resulting in a single product.

Wait, but in the case where the substituent is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), the elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, which is across the ring from the substituent. So that would be the only possible product.

Alternatively, if the substituent is at position 2, perhaps the elimination can only occur in one way, leading to a single product.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent can lead to the formation of two different products, depending on which hydrogen is abstracted. But if the substituent is at position 2, the only available hydrogen adjacent to Br is at position 6, so elimination can only form the triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a single product.

So, in that case, the number of products would be one.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent allows for more than one product. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group, maybe elimination can happen at position 6 and at another position, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at position 2. If the Br is at position 1, the only possible adjacent position for elimination is position 6, because position 2 has the substituent. So only one product would form.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is such that the elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to more than one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent can lead to the formation of two different isomers of the product, such as cis and trans, but in aromatic systems, that's not applicable because the ring is flat.

Wait, maybe the substituent is in a position that allows for multiple sites of elimination. For example, if the substituent is at position 2, perhaps elimination can occur not only at position 6 but also at position 3 or another position, but that's unlikely because the Br is at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a good leaving group, but that's not the case here since the substituent is 'd', which I'm not sure about.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

If the reaction produces a single product, the answer would be B) 1. If it produces more, then another option.

But wait, another angle: maybe the reaction forms a diradical intermediate, leading to possible formation of different products based on where the bonding occurs. But in aromatic systems, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent directs the elimination so that the triple bond forms in two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 leads to the formation of a structure where the triple bond can be in two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is such that when the triple bond forms, there are two possible regioisomers.

But wait, in aromatic compounds, once the triple bond is formed, the positions are fixed. So if the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, then the substituent is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1, but that's it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent can lead to the formation of more than one position for the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent can lead to multiple positions for elimination, such as elimination at position 6 and another position, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the substituent is such that after elimination, the substituent can be in different positions relative to the triple bond, leading to different products. For example, if the substituent is in the meta position relative to the triple bond, but that's just a matter of numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent can lead to the formation of two different isomers based on the orientation of the substituent.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6, then the substituent is in the position adjacent to the triple bond, but that's the same in both cases.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach. When a halobenzene has a substituent that is ortho to the halogen, which is the case here (Br at 1, substituent at 2), the elimination would occur in such a way that the substituent is in a position that can influence the site of the triple bond.

Wait, in the case of 1-bromo-2-d benzene, when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, the Br leaves and the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6. But then, substituent at 2 is adjacent to position 1, so perhaps this would lead to the formation of a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's presence can lead to different regiochemistry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another point: when a substituent is present, the formation of benzyne can lead to different products based on the substituent's position and the site of elimination. For example, if the substituent is at position 2 (ortho to Br), the elimination could form a triple bond either between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, but considering the substituent's presence, perhaps only one is possible.

Wait, but if substituent is at 2, then the triple bond can't form between 1 and 2 because substituent is already present. So elimination can only occur between 1 and 6, leading to a single product.

So in that case, only one product is formed, so the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent allows for elimination at two different positions, leading to two products. So if the substituent is at 2, then elimination can occur at position 6 (leading to triple bond between 1 and 6) and perhaps another position, leading to another product.

Wait, but the Br is only at position 1, so the only adjacent positions are 2 and 6. If position 2 has a substituent, the only available H is at position 6. So elimination would occur there, leading to only one product.

So the answer would be B) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the elimination can occur in more than one way, leading to more than one product.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it, so I'm inclined to think that only one product is formed.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base, and in such reactions, elimination typically occurs. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has a bromine atom at position 1 and a substituent (denoted as "d") at position 2. The substituent's nature is not explicitly clear, but it is assumed to remain attached to the benzene ring during the reaction.

In aromatic systems, elimination reactions involving a halogen (e.g., bromine) and a strong base like NaNHâ‚‚ often lead to the formation of a triple bond (benzyne) through dehydrohalogenation. The bromine atom at position 1 is flanked by carbons at positions 2 and 6. The base abstracts a Î²-hydrogen from one of these positions, and the bromine leaves, forming a triple bond between the adjacent carbons.

Given the substituent at position 2, the hydrogen at position 6 is the only available Î²-hydrogen for elimination (since position 2 is already occupied by the substituent). This leads to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, resulting in a single product. The substituent at position 2 does not allow for elimination at any other position, as the bromine is fixed at position 1, and the substituent itself does not influence the reaction pathway in a way that would produce multiple products.

Thus, the reaction produces only one possible organic product.

Answer: B
