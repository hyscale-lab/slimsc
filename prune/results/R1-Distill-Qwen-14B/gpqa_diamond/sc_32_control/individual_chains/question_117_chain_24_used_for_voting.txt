Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms where the four different groups attached make it non-superimposable on its mirror image. So, the compound would have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, wait. So, on each benzene ring, there's a nitro group at 6' and a carboxylate ester at 2. But wait, the structure is such that the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So the numbering is 6 on each ring, and 2 on each. Wait, so each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The molecule is symmetrical, right? Because the substituents are in positions that mirror each other. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or does the arrangement allow for a chiral center?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The molecule is dimethyl, so the ester groups are OMe. Each ring has a nitro and two ester groups? Or is each ring substituted in two positions? Oh, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6. Then, 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each ring has a carboxylate group at position 2. So each ring has two substituents? Wait no, 2,2'- would imply each ring has a carboxylate at position 2, and 6,6' would have nitro at position 6.

Wait, the biphenyl is 1,1', so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position. So each ring has substituents at position 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro (6) and a carboxylate (2). Are these substituents in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Because if the two rings are symmetrical, the overall molecule might not be chiral.

Alternatively, think about whether the substituents create a chiral center. Wait, the central carbon connecting the biphenyl? No, because the biphenyl is connected by a single bond, so rotation is possible. So even if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe the molecule isn't chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has two substituents, maybe the biphenyl as a whole isn't symmetric. Let me sketch it mentally. The biphenyl has two benzene rings attached at position 1. On each ring, position 2 is a COOCH3 group, and position 6 is a NO2 group. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So for each ring, the substituents are in a para arrangement. But the two rings are attached in such a way that the substituents are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings. If that's the case, then the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism here. Hmm, but wait, could there be a possibility of the molecule being chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the central bond?

Alternatively, perhaps each benzene ring isn't symmetric. Wait, let's think about the positions. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. When rings are connected at position 1, then the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So if you imagine looking at the molecule, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So the arrangement on the two rings would mirror each other, leading to symmetry. So perhaps the molecule is achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So maybe compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   - The formula would be CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; so 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; the hydroxy is on the second carbon: so it's CH3CH(OH)COO-; but wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. But wait, wait, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, that would be a chiral center at the middle carbon. Because the middle carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's see: the central carbon is connected to (from 2-hydroxypropanoate): the carbon chain would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as (R)- or (S)-lactic acid's ester. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH2- maybe?), 
Wait, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from CH3-CH(OH)-)
- COOCH3 (from -COOCH3)
- OH
- and the adjacent CH2, but wait, no. Let me number the carbons. 

Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the next is the second, then the third. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, the central carbon (the one with OH) is the second carbon. Let's see: the central carbon is attached to:

- CH2OH (from the first carbon, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with an OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the actual structure: the carbons are arranged as CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH2(OH): but that's the same as the parent carbon. Hmm. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. Then, the ester would be CH3CHOHCOOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3-)
- COOCH3 (from -COOCH3)
- OH
- and the adjacent CH (from the next carbon). Wait, the adjacent carbon is connected to another CH3? No, the next carbon is COOCH3. So maybe the central carbon has groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group? Oh wait, no. Let me think about the actual structure. 

The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. And the other two bonds are to the adjacent carbons. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So the CH(OH) is attached to:

- Left: CH3
- Right: COOCH3
- OH
- And two other single bonds. Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

The central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. So it's connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- Hydroxyl (OH)
- And a hydrogen? No, wait, no hydrogen because it's CH(OH). So the groups are:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- And a single bond to another carbon (to carbon 3), but wait, carbon 3 is the COOCH3. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the exact substituents.

Wait, another approach: the central carbon (carbon 2) has four substituents:

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- and another hydrogen? Or another substituent?

Wait, no, wait: in the structure CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (the OH-bearing one) is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

1. CH3 (carbon 1)
2. COOCH3 (carbon 3)
3. OH
4. And another hydrogen? No, wait, no. Because it's CH(OH), that implies two substituents on that carbon: the OH and the two adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbons are numbered 1, 2, 3.

1: CH3-
2: -CH(OH)-
3: -COOCH3

So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen? Because it's CH2(OH) would have two H's, but here it's CH(OH), which is CH2 with an OH. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. Carbon 2 would be connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- OH
- And another CH2? No, maybe I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon has four different groups.

Wait, yes. Let me list the substituents:

Carbon 2 has:

1. CH3 (from carbon 1)
2. COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
3. OH
4. And another CH2 group? No, wait, carbon 2 is CH(OH), so the substituents are:

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- OH
- And a hydrogen? No, because the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon would have:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- and a hydrogen? But then the groups would be CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So four different groups, making it a chiral center. So yes, this compound has a chiral center, hence it can show optical isomerism. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**
   - Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the carbonyl group is in the center, with two phenyl groups attached. The question is, does this have a chiral center? The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to O, so they can't be chiral. So no chiral centers here. Also, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. So compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**
   - Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is in the cis configuration (Z), while fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. Wait, wait, actually, wait: fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-2,3-dimethylbutenedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
But wait, no. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH2COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3)CH2? No, wait, the structure is more like:

          O
           \
            C=O
           /
O-C-OCH3  CH2CH2  O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

CH2-C(=O)OCH3
   \     /
    C=C
   /     \
CH2-C(=O)OCH3

No, wait, more accurately, the molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism leading to optical isomerism? Wait, no, because geometric isomerism (cis-trans) does not necessarily lead to optical isomerism. However, in some cases, if the compound has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral, but if the structure lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, but does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's check. The structure is:

COOCH3
   |
O=C-CH2-CH2-CO OCH3
   |
   double bond

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's CH2CH2 with the two ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)

No, wait, for fumaric acid, the structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, and the ester would replace the Hs with OCH3.

So dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
But with double bond. So the structure is CH2CH2 with a double bond between the two middle carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
       \
CH2-CH2
       /
COOCH3

But with the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No, that's not correct. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

But wait, does that create any chiral centers? Let's see: the molecule's structure is O=C-OCH3 on either end of a double bond.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

The molecule is (E)-2,3-dimethylbutenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no, that would be a four-carbon chain with double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond, with the middle part being CH2 on either side.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C=C - C - O-C-OCH3
           |     |
           CH3  CH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But without any other substituents, the molecule would be symmetrical. Wait, if both ends are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. But wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same, so if the double bond is in the trans configuration, does it lead to a chiral structure?

Wait, wait, another approach: if a molecule has a double bond and substituents on each carbon that are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. Wait, no, because fumarate is made from maleic acid, which is (Z), but fumarate is (E). Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E). So the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

COOCH3
       \
CH2-CH2
       /
COOCH3

But with a double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
COOCH3

Wait, but in that case, it's symmetrical. Because each end is the same. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought that in some cases, the trans isomer can be chiral. But in this case, since the substituents are the same on each side, perhaps it's not chiral.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think: can a molecule with a double bond be chiral without any chiral centers? Yes, if it's a chiral molecule due to lack of a plane of symmetry. For example, 2-pentene with different substituents on each carbon. But in this case, both substituents on each carbon are the same. So if each end is identical, then the molecule can't be chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and not chiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-dioxydibenzene? No, wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The molecule is (E)-CH2-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)-CH2? No, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2 but in the trans configuration. So each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group attached.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon would have two substituents. For example, each has a COOCH3 and a methyl group. Wait, no, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the two middle carbons in the four-carbon chain are attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. No, that would imply that the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, which isn't the case for fumarate.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in this case, each C in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and maybe a CH3?), but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers but is a geometric isomer. However, geometric isomerism (cis-trans) doesn't imply optical isomerism. So even if the molecule has E or Z isomerism, it doesn't necessarily exhibit optical activity unless it's chiral.

Wait, but perhaps dimethyl fumarate has two identical substituents on each carbon of the double bond, making it symmetrical. Hence, it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think about the actual structure of fumarate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, the -OH groups are replaced by OCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each of the double bond carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group. Wait, no, wait, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration. So each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is more accurately:

Each of the two central carbons (the double bond) has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but arranged trans.

Wait, no, wait, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)?

No, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that seems like a four-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense for fumarate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
COOCH3

But each C in the double bond is also attached to two other carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diastereomer and does not have a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, then the molecule could be chiral. Let me think. If each carbon in the double bond has two different groups, perhaps the arrangement leads to chirality.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but arranged trans. So each carbon has:

- COOCH3 group
- CH3 group
- And two substituents across the double bond.

But wait, if each carbon in the double bond has the same substituents, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, no, that would not lead to optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong earlier about compound 4. Let me think again. Wait, dimethyl fumarate: is there any possibility it has a chiral center? No, because the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same (each has COOCH3 and another group—maybe I'm getting this wrong). Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has two different substituents besides the double bond. So for example, each carbon has a COOCH3, a CH3, and two other substituents. Hmm, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps it's better to proceed.

So, compiling the findings:

1. No optical isomerism (symmetrical)
2. Yes (chiral center)
3. No
4. No

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 might have optical isomerism. Wait, no, I think I concluded it doesn't. So the compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and 4? Or no, wait, earlier I thought 4 doesn't show it.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-2,3-dimethylbutenedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, in that case, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the substituents on each end are different. For example, if one end has two different groups and the other end has two different groups, but arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps fumarate has two identical groups on each end, making it symmetrical and thus not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (4) doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 only. Wait, but looking back at the options, let me see:

Options are A) 1, 2 and 4; B) 3 and 4; C) 2 and 3; D)1 and 2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2

So according to my analysis, only 2 does. But none of the options have just 2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of one of the compounds.

Wait, let me re-examine compound 1.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate

The structure is two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.

If the two rings are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the arrangement is such that the substituents on each ring lead to a lack of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the nitro and carboxylate groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, the biphenyl structure can have two orientations: the substituents can be on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans). If the substituents are in a cis arrangement, the molecule might be chiral. But if they are trans, then it's symmetrical.

Wait, but wait, for a biphenyl to be chiral, the substituents must be arranged in a way that creates a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule is achiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. If the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate is at 2 on each ring, then looking at the arrangement, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is actually chiral.

Wait, let me think again: the structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So each of the two central carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. No, no, wait, perhaps each carbon is attached to two different groups.

Wait, for example, the structure could be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration. So each C in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. Wait, no, because if each is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3, then each has two identical substituents. So the molecule would be symmetrical, leading to no chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. For example, one side has a COOCH3 and a CH2CH3, and the other side has a COOCH3 and another group. Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end are such that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two identical substituents on each end, making it symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Hmm, maybe I should accept that I might have made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me look for another way. Let me think about the structure of fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate is (Z), and fumarate is (E). So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But dimethyl fumarate would have each of the two ester groups on opposite sides. So the structure is:

COOCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
COOCH3

In this case, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. In this case, the plane would bisect the double bond, making each half a mirror image. So the molecule is achiral.

So the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But looking back at the options, none of them have only 2.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4
B)3 and4
C)2 and3
D)1 and2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, no, because the fumarate ester doesn't have any chiral centers. The substituents on the double bond are not creating a chiral center; they're creating geometric isomerism. So no optical isomerism.

So going back, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have such an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, looking again at compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

If the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), then each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH3 (if the other substituent is a methyl group). Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Maybe each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3)CH2?

No, I think I'm stuck. Let me see what the options are. The options are A, B, C, D as listed.

In the given options, only option A includes compound 2. So if compound 2 is correct, and perhaps I missed another compound, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 1. Let me think again about the structure of compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. The two benzene rings are connected at position 1.

So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, the biphenyl can have substituents that are either on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans). If the substituents are in a cis arrangement, the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are trans, the molecule might be symmetrical.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are para to each other. So the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. Thus, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So back to the original point: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: if the substituents on the double bond are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if one substituent is a COOCH3 and another is a CH2CH3, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, fumarate is (E), so the substituents are on opposite sides. But if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4
B)3 and4
C)2 and3
D)1 and2.

So if the correct answer is only 2, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in another compound.

Wait, perhaps I have to re-look at compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate.

Another approach: what is the structure of dimethyl fumarate?

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-2,3-dimethylbutenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but in the E configuration.

Wait, but that would mean each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in that case, it's symmetrical. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So it's not chiral.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if one side has a COOCH3 and a CH3, and the other has a COOCH3 and another group. But in fumarate, the substituents are the same on each end, so symmetry exists.

Thus, I must conclude that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and others. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me try another angle. Wait, fumarate (the acid) is not chiral, but its ester may be.

Wait, no, fumarate is (E), which is a geometric isomer, not a chiral isomer. So the ester would also have geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism.

So, I think the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the first compound, perhaps it can exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again. Maybe the dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral. So for example, if the nitro groups are on the same side, making the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So when the rings are connected at position 1, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring might be arranged in a way that creates chirality.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the central carbon of the biphenyl. But in biphenyls, the central bond is a single bond, so the molecule can rotate, leading to possible symmetry.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged such that no plane of symmetry exists, then the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, both rings have identical substituents at 2 and 6, making the molecule symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion based on my analysis, even if it doesn't match the options. According to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So then, the only correct compound is 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. If the substituents on the double bond are different, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, if one end has a COOCH3 and a CH3, and the other end has a COOCH3 and a different group. But in dimethyl fumarate, both ends are the same.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. The options are:

A)1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2.

So according to my analysis, only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in another compound.

Wait, perhaps I missed that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine looking at the molecule from the double bond. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So it's achiral.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is only 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In this structure, each end has the same substituents, so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, in conclusion, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I missed another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 1. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center in compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Could the arrangement of these substituents on the biphenyl create a chiral center? For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, the biphenyl is connected such that the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring. If these substituents are in a way that their arrangement across the biphenyl bond is not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis or a chiral plane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central carbon with four different groups, making it chiral.

Wait, the biphenyl structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The central bond allows rotation, so unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is rigid, it may not be chiral.

But considering that the substituents are nitro and carboxylate groups, which are bulkier, perhaps the molecule cannot rotate freely, leading to a fixed configuration and thus chirality.

Wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face of each ring, the molecule could lack symmetry.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in para positions. So the arrangement would be symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, after reevaluating, I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is A)1,2,4, which might be incorrect, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again: if dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with two different substituents on each end, it could be chiral. But in reality, each end has the same substituents (COOCH3 and CH3?), making it symmetrical.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the only correct option is 2, which isn't present. But perhaps the correct answer is A)1,2,4, which would mean that I was wrong in assessing compounds 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. Another thought: perhaps the molecule has two identical ester groups on each end, but the double bond being in the trans configuration makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, even if the substituents are the same, then it could be chiral.

Wait, for example, in the case of 2-pentene, if the two substituents on each end are the same, the molecule isn't chiral. But in the case of (E)-butenedioate, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to chirality.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, each end has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but in a trans arrangement. Wait, but if both ends are the same, then the molecule would still be symmetrical.

Hmm, perhaps I have to accept that I might have made a mistake in considering compound 4. If the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, then I must have made a mistake in assessing whether 4 shows optical isomerism.

But according to my analysis, 4 doesn't. So perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the analysis that only 2 is correct, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended correct answer is A)1,2,4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1. Let me think again: if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face of the biphenyl, and the carboxylate groups are on the opposite face, the molecule could be chiral. Thus, compound 1 would show optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compounds 1 and 2 would show optical isomerism, making option D correct. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of substituents leads to a lack of symmetry.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a decision based on my analysis. According to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and others.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But if the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer is only 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1. Maybe it is chiral.

Another approach: perhaps the biphenyl has substituents that create a chiral center. For example, the two benzene rings connected at position 1, with substituents on positions 2 and 6 that are arranged asymmetrically, leading to a chiral center at the connecting bond.

Wait, but the connecting bond is a single bond, so the molecule can rotate, making it impossible to have a chiral center at that point. Unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule cannot rotate into a symmetrical position.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. I think I should proceed to the conclusion based on my analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups) or a chiral axis, making the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   - The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at position 6 and carboxylate ester groups at position 2 on each ring.  
   - The substituents on each ring are identical (nitro and carboxylate groups), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond.  
   - Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   - The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.  
   - The central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.  
   - This creates a chiral center, making the molecule capable of optical isomerism.  
   - Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   - The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon.  
   - The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups.  
   - There are no chiral centers, and the molecule is symmetrical.  
   - Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   - The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), where the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.  
   - Each carbon in the double bond is attached to identical groups (COOCH3 and CH3), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond.  
   - Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism.  
- None of the options provided match this conclusion. However, based on the given options, **Option A (1, 2, and 4)** is the closest, though it incorrectly includes compounds 1 and 4, which do not exhibit optical isomerism.
