Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their density is the same throughout space. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Let's think in terms of a volume of space. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So, the number within a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

But how does that translate to parallax? Parallax is 1/d, so if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. Wait, but here the shell would be a thin slice, but because parallax is involved, I need to relate d and plx.

Wait, plx (in arcseconds) is 1/d (in parsecs). So, if I consider a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx (a small change), that corresponds to a range in distance from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction, but for the number of stars, we're concerned with magnitude. So ignoring the negative, the volume is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. So that's (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The volume of the shell is 4πd² dd. Since d is 1/plx, substituting gives 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) dplx ). Because dd is (d dplx) where d is -1/plx². So dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But the absolute value is (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume becomes (4π) * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Now, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars (n). So, number of stars N = n * volume = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if we take a small dplx, the number per unit dplx is N/(dplx) = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx / dplx. So that's n *4π / plx^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx (in a small range dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, that would mean the number decreases rapidly as plx increases. Hmm.

But wait, wait. Another approach: the number of stars in a given range of plx (from plx to plx + dplx) is n * 4πd² dd. But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in distance corresponding to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx^2). So the change in d is approximately -d² dplx. So dd ≈ -d^2 dplx = -(1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²)(-d^2 dplx) )= substituting d=1/plx, that's 4π (1/plx^2)( (1/plx^2) dplx ) ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx (dplx). So when you divide by dplx, you get n *4π / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, another way to think about this: the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those distances. So the volume is the integral from d to d + dd of 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, and plx is varying, perhaps we should set up an integral in terms of plx.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a range of plx dplx is the volume of the shell between plx and plx + dplx multiplied by the number density.

Wait, but as plx increases, d decreases. So the volume of a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd, but when plx increases by dplx, the corresponding change in d is from d to d - delta d (since higher plx means lower d). So the volume is 4π (d^2) (dd) where dd = (d - (d - delta d)) )= delta d ≈ (1/(plx + dplx) ) - (1/plx) )= (plx - (plx + dplx)) / (plx (plx + dplx)) ) = (-dplx)/(plx^2 + plx dplx) ≈ -dplx / plx^2 for small dplx.

So volume is 4π d² * (dd) = 4π (1/plx^2) [ (-dplx)/(plx^2) ) ] = 4π (1/plx^2)(dplx/(plx^2) ) [because the negative just indicates direction, but the magnitude is what counts for the number of stars]. So that's 4π dplx/(plx^4).

Thus, the number of stars in that range is n * 4π dplx/(plx^4), so per unit dplx, it's 4π n / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer would be option A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that the number of stars (per unit distance) would follow a certain relation. Let me think again about the relation between distance and volume.

Suppose the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr multiplied by the number density n. Since dr is small, this is the count.

But d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the count becomes 4π (1/(plx)^2) * ( - (1/(plx)^2) dplx ) * n. Again, ignoring the negative, it's 4π n (1/(plx^4)) dplx. So per unit dplx, it's 4π n / plx^4.

So yes, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but another thought: how does the number of stars per unit volume change with distance? It's uniform, so n is constant. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4π d²) times the thickness dd. So, yes, as d increases, the volume of the shell increases with d² * dd. But since plx is 1/d, this translates into how the number changes with plx.

So, since the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, option A is correct.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \), where \( d\text{plx} \) is the small range of parallax.

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the product of the volume and the number density of stars \( n \), which is constant. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^4 \).

Option A, which states \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), is therefore correct.
