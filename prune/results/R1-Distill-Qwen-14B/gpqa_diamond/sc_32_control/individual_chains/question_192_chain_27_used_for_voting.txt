Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and s is less than R because the cavity is inside. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both L and l are bigger than R. There's also an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think that the charges will redistribute in the conductor.

Wait, right. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. For a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce opposite charges on the inner surface. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would then have +q to balance because the conductor was initially neutral.

But wait, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q. The outer surface must then have a charge of +q to make the total zero.

But in this problem, the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center. So the induced charge on the inner surface won't be uniformly distributed. The inner surface will have a charge distribution that's not symmetric because the cavity is off-center. However, for points outside the conductor, does this asymmetry affect the electric field?

I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Because, according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside depends on the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So if the conductor has a net charge, the field is as if all the charge were at the center. But wait, in this case, the conductor's total charge is zero (since it's neutral, and it's just the inner and outer charges that are +q and -q, respectively, adding to zero).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Therefore, when considering a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the total enclosed charge would be the charge on the conductor, which is zero. So the electric field outside the conductor should be zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because the point P is outside, but there's a charge +q inside the cavity. How does that affect the field outside the conductor?

Wait, no. Because the conductor shields the inside from the outside. The charges on the conductor arrange in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. But the field outside depends on the total charge of the conductor, which is zero. So the field outside should be zero. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the charge +q is inside, but the conductor's outer surface is +q. So wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside would be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

1. The conductor is neutral, so overall charge is zero.

2. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q.

3. The distribution of charges on the inner surface will depend on the position of the charge +q inside the cavity. Since the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center, the +q is not at the center. So the inner surface's -q charge won't be uniformly distributed. It will be closer to where the charge is, perhaps.

4. However, for points outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within the conductor. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the field outside should be zero. But wait, that's not correct because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the outer surface's charge would produce an electric field outside.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The conductor's total charge is zero, but the inner surface has -q and the outer +q. So the total charge of the conductor is zero. So when considering a Gaussian surface that encloses the entire conductor, the enclosed charge is zero. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor must be zero.

But wait, that can't be right because the outer surface has a charge of +q. So any point outside should feel the field due to that +q. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I made a mistake. Let's clarify.

The conductor is neutral, so the initial charge is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's walls) must have -q. Because the conductor is a good conductor, charges move freely. The conductor's own material has electrons, so the +q induces a -q on the inner surface, leaving the remaining conductor with a +q on the outer surface.

So the conductor's total charge is +q (on outer) + (-q on inner) = 0. So the conductor is neutral.

But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the conductor and the +q inside the cavity. But wait, the Gaussian surface outside will enclose all charges inside it. The conductor's inner charge (-q) and the outer charge (+q). But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge inside the Gaussian surface would be zero, but the +q inside the cavity is not part of the conductor, so it would be included.

Wait, no. The charge +q is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor. So when you have a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, it will enclose the conductor and the +q inside. The conductor's net charge is zero, so the total enclosed charge is +q. Therefore, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is q/(epsilon_0). By Gauss's Law, the flux is E * 4 pi L^2 = q/(epsilon_0). So E = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 L^2), same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the previous thought. So which is correct?

I think the confusion arises because the conductor's charges affect the field inside the conductor, but the field outside depends on the total charge of the conductor. But in this case, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the field outside would be zero. But that can't be right because the +q is inside, and the conductor's outer surface has +q.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside should be due to the +q on the outer surface. The conductor being neutral doesn't change that because the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field outside is as if that charge were concentrated at the center.

Ah! So the conductor being neutral refers to its own material. The cavity's +q is inside the conductor. So the Gaussian surface outside would enclose the conductor and the +q. But the conductor's net charge is zero (because inner is -q, outer is +q), so the total enclosed charge is +q. Therefore, the electric field outside is as if the +q were at the center.

So the electric field at point P, which is outside, should be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the magnitude would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q / L^2), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4 pi ε0)) (q / L²), which matches. But wait, let me think again about the setup.

The problem states that the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. The angle theta is between l and s.

Wait, so the charge +q is not at the center of the conductor. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the +q is somewhere inside the cavity, but how does that affect the field outside?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me clarify the situation again.

The conductor is neutral. Inside the cavity, which is offset from the center, there's a charge +q. The conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface has +q. 

For the electric field outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor and the cavity's charge. The conductor's net charge is zero, but the +q in the cavity is enclosed. So the total enclosed charge is +q.

Wait, wait no. The conductor's charge is zero, but the cavity's charge is +q. So the total enclosed charge in the Gaussian surface outside is zero plus +q, which is +q. Therefore, the field is as if there's a charge +q at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the conductor's inner surface is induced with -q, but the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is at position determined by the center of the cavity. So the effective charge outside is the conductor's own charge, which is +q on the outer surface.

So the electric field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface, which is located at the center of the conductor. Hence, the field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L²), which is option B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is (q)/(L²), and option D is (q)/l². Hmm. So why would l be relevant here?

Wait a second, the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. But the charges are on the conductor's surfaces. The field outside depends on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q on the outer surface. So the field should be as if that +q is at the conductor's center. So the distance from P to the center is L, so E is (q)/(4πε₀ L²).

So option B is correct.

But what about the other options? Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared in the denominator. That would make sense if the field was due to the charge inside the cavity but shielded by the conductor. But outside the conductor, the shielding effect means the field is as if all the conductor's charge were at the center. So the position of the cavity's charge doesn't matter for points outside. Only the total charge on the conductor matters.

So in this case, the field outside is due to the conductor's outer charge, so the answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is neutral, meaning its total charge is zero. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's walls) induces a charge of $-q$, and the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. The conductor's total charge is $+q$ on the outer surface. By Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the entire charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

3. **Irrelevance of $l$ and $\theta$**: The distance $l$ (distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity) and the angle $\theta$ are not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor, which is $+q$ on the outer surface, and not on the distribution of charges inside the cavity.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor is due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface, and the magnitude is $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the denominator $l^2$ might seem plausible, the electric field outside depends on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
