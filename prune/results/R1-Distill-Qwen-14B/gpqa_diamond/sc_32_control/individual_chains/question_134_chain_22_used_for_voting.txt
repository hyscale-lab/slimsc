Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, meaning it releases heat. But wait, sometimes it's the opposite, but I think in most cases, especially for strong acids and bases, it's exothermic. 

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me list out the given data. 

First solution: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. So HCl is a strong acid, monoprotic, I think. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions.

Second solution: 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives two H+ ions. Wait, but I've heard that the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in strong acids, they fully dissociate. So for H2SO4, maybe both H+ ions are released. So each mole gives 2 H+.

Third solution: 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2. So each mole gives 2 OH-.

So when these three are mixed, I think the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base to form water. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change for this is usually about -57 kJ/mol, but I might be mixing up the exact value. Wait, sometimes it's given as -55.8 kJ/mol, but I'll have to check that. Alternatively, maybe the value is in kcal; wait, because the options mix both kJ and kcal. Hmm, the options have A and B in kcal, C and D in kJ. So I need to be careful with units.

The plan is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, find out which is the limiting reactant to determine how much neutralization occurs. Then, multiply the moles by the enthalpy per mole of reaction to get the total enthalpy change.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.5 L.
Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since it's monoprotic, 0.1 moles H+.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H+.

3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 *0.2=0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 *2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So yes, 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The total H+ available is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- available is 0.2 moles.

So, which is the limiting reagent? The OH- is the limiting because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react. Each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of water, releasing 57 kJ (I think). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact value. Let me think. I've heard that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Or perhaps it's -55.8 kJ/mol. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as 57.3 kJ/mol for H+ and OH- combining. Hmm, but I think for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's 57 kJ released.

So the total moles of H+ that react would be 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait again. Some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57.3 kJ/mol (at 25°C). So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57.3 kJ.

So if I use that, 0.2 moles would release 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. Oh wait, but the options have -11.42 kcal as option B, and another option is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I should check the units. The question asks for enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically in kJ, but the options include kcal and kJ.

Wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. 1 kcal is 1000 cal = 4184 J, which is about 4.184 kJ. So if I have a value in kJ, I can convert to kcal by dividing by 4.184.

Wait, but in the problem, the enthalpy per mole is in either kJ or kcal. Let's see the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be approximately -48.3 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 48 kJ). But in our calculation, we have 11.46 kJ. So that's conflicting with option B. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy per mole is given as -57 kcal/mol? Wait, that can't be, because 57 kcal is way bigger than the usual value.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's take a step back.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H+ reacting. So, for each mole of H+ that reacts with OH-, the enthalpy change is -57.3 kJ.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So that would be approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way higher. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert 11.46 kJ to kcal. Since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal (because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 1/4.184 ≈ 0.239), so 11.46 kJ * 0.239 ≈ approximately 2.73 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger.

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid reacting. Wait, but no, neutralization is per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 *2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 *2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. None of the options match that. Or wait, maybe I'm using the wrong enthalpy value.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, but that's not right because HCl and H2SO4 contribute different amounts of H+.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- correctly, then see which is the limiting.

Wait, another way: the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases 57.3 kJ. So the total H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the maximum moles of water formed is 0.2, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ—no, that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal instead of kJ. Because 11.46 kJ is about 2.737 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe I used the wrong enthalpy value. Let me think again. Oh, wait! I think the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for strong acids and strong bases is often given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which is equivalent to -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ + OH- reaction. So the calculation is correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo or I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert my result of -11.46 kJ to kcal. Since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal, so 11.46 kJ * 0.239 = approximately 2.73 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal. So that's much higher, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the total moles of H+ and OH- and see if maybe there's excess H+ left, but the neutralization would only proceed until the limiting reagent is used up. So let's think again: 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

All OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+. So 0.08 mol H+ remains unreacted. But that doesn't affect the enthalpy calculation because only 0.2 mol reacts. So the enthalpy is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.73 kcal. Hmm, that's close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is given as 57.3 kJ per mole of reaction, and considering that the problem has more than one mole of H+ from H2SO4, maybe I need to calculate based on the moles of H+ available.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is diprotic and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic as well, but perhaps the neutralization is more complex.

Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So in neutralization, each mole can donate two H+ ions. So when Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole gives two OH- ions. So for each mole of H2SO4, it can neutralize two moles of OH-. Similarly, each mole of HCl can neutralize one mole of OH-.

So, perhaps the way to approach it is to find out how much OH- is available and how much H+ is available, then see which is the limiting.

But that's what I did earlier. So why am I not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ from all acids and all OH- from base, but then perhaps I should calculate the net H+ after neutralization.

Wait, but H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So after neutralization, H+ left is 0.08. But the enthalpy change is determined only by the amount that reacts.

Hmm, so back to the calculation. 0.2 mol reacting, so 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ released. So the change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ—no, that's not matching. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute it in a different way, like considering the individual neutralizations separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 *0.2 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L *0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide, so in solution, it's Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is -57.3 kJ, but the problem expects it to be accounted per mole of H2SO4 and HCl.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -3.80 kcal per mole. Let me see. If 0.2 moles react, then 0.2 * (-3.80 kcal/mol) = -0.76 kcal. No, that's not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of total moles of H+ and OH- and find out the net.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

Net H+ = 0.08 mol.

But the enthalpy is only from the neutralization that occurs, which is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy is -57.3 *0.2 = -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is -11.42 kcal, which would imply that 0.2 moles give -2.284 kcal, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, maybe the moles were calculated incorrectly. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 =0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that H2SO4's second H+ doesn't fully dissociate, but I don't think that's the case because H2SO4 is a strong acid. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. The first H+ of H2SO4 dissociates completely, but the second one might not in some cases. But for the purpose of neutralization calculations, I think we treat both as dissociated, especially since it's a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a base and each mole provides two OH-, but perhaps the solution's concentration is in mol/L, but maybe volume needs to be converted differently.

No, I think I did that correctly: 200 mL is 0.2 L.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization in a different way, like per liter or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value. For example, if the enthalpy per mole is -57.3 kJ, then 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. If my calculation is 11.46 kJ, and 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, then 11.46 kJ is about 2.737 kcal. So that's not matching option B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is providing 2 moles of OH- per mole, but perhaps the H2SO4 is only providing one mole of H+? No, that can't be right because H2SO4 is diprotic and a strong acid. So I think I accounted for it correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that only the first H+ from H2SO4 dissociates, but that's not correct. Only the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second is a weak acid. So in that case, in neutralization, perhaps the second H+ is not available. So for H2SO4, each mole gives one H+ (the first), and the second is weak. So in neutralization, perhaps only the first H+ is considered. But wait, that would change the moles of H+ available.

In that case, H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 mol of H+ (since each mole gives one for the first dissociation). So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 would be 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 mol. Then, OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ is the limiting, with 0.19 mol. So OH- would have 0.2 - 0.19 = 0.01 mol left. So the neutralization would be 0.19 mol H+ and 0.19 mol OH- reacting, releasing 0.19 *57.3 = 10.89 kJ. That's about -10.89 kJ. But none of the options match that either.

Hmm, but the problem states that H2SO4 is a strong acid. So I think it's correct to assume both H+ are available.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a base that provides two OH- per mole, so 0.5 M *0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different enthalpy value. Let me check another source. Oh, I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which is the same as per mole of H+ reacting.

So, going back, the calculation is correct: 0.2 moles reacting → -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option B, but I'm confused because 11.46 kJ is about 2.73 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 48.2 kJ.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the units. Oh! Wait a second. The problem gives the volumes in mL, but I converted them to liters correctly. So that's fine.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. The question says, when the three solutions are mixed. So perhaps the solution is not just H+ and OH- reacting, but there might be a precipitation reaction because of the mixing of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. Wait, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would form BaSO4, which is a precipitate. But that's a separate reaction, and the enthalpy of that precipitation would need to be considered as well.

Wait, that's a possibility. Oh, right! Because when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they can form BaSO4, which is a sparingly soluble salt. So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But wait, in that reaction, each mole of H2SO4 would react with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O. So that's a separate reaction which may have its own enthalpy change.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the problem expects me to consider that. Because if I include that, the calculation becomes more complex. Let me think.

So, when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

But this reaction requires the H+ from H2SO4 to react with OH- from Ba(OH)2, and also for the SO4^2- to combine with Ba^2+ to form BaSO4.

So perhaps the enthalpy change is the sum of the neutralization enthalpy and the precipitation enthalpy.

But that complicates things because I don't have the enthalpy of formation for BaSO4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the precipitation and only consider the neutralization of H+ and OH-.

But without knowing the enthalpy of the precipitation reaction, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the precipitation doesn't occur, or that the solution is such that Ba(OH)2 is in excess and all H+ from H2SO4 and HCl neutralizes the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and the remaining OH- would be in solution, but no precipitate forms.

Wait, but if we have H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 in solution, the Ba^2+ and SO4^2- could form BaSO4, which is a precipitate. So perhaps part of the H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which would affect the available H+ and OH-.

So let me think about that. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

This is a neutralization and precipitation reaction. In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So the moles of H2SO4 available are 0.09 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2 available are 0.1 mol. So the limiting reagent here is H2SO4, which is 0.09 mol. So all 0.09 mol of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 precipitate and 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but how much H+ and OH- are involved in this reaction?

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ (if fully dissociated), and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

In the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 would neutralize 2 moles of OH- (because H2SO4 is diprotic), so:

H2SO4 + 2 OH- → SO4^2- + 2 H2O.

Wait, but wait, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, it's in a 1:1 ratio.

H2SO4 (2 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-) → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of OH- are consumed.

So, in the reaction, 0.09 mol of H2SO4 would react with 0.18 mol of OH- from Ba(OH)2. But wait, the available OH- is 0.2 mol. So if 0.18 mol is used up in this reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol.

Now, what about the H+ from HCl and the remaining H+ from H2SO4?

Wait, after the precipitation reaction, the H2SO4 is consumed, so the remaining H+ comes only from HCl and any H+ from the second dissociation of H2SO4 (if any). But since H2SO4 is a strong acid, the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second might not be. Hmm, but in the reaction, perhaps the H+ is consumed in the precipitation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) ↓ + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so H2SO4 is limiting. So 0.09 mol of H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

In this reaction, 2 H+ ions from H2SO4 react with 2 OH- ions from Ba(OH)2. So each mole of H2SO4 consumes 2 moles of OH-.

So, in this case, 0.09 mol H2SO4 would consume 0.18 mol OH-.

The available OH- is 0.2 mol. So after this reaction, 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol OH- remains.

Now, what about the H+ from HCl and the remaining H+ from H2SO4?

Wait, in the reaction above, the H2SO4 is fully consumed, so there's no H+ left from H2SO4. The H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol. So the H+ available from HCl is 0.1 mol.

The remaining OH- is 0.02 mol.

So the next reaction is the neutralization of H+ from HCl with the remaining OH-.

H+ (from HCl) + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ available: 0.1 mol.

Moles of OH- available: 0.02 mol.

OH- is the limiting reagent here. So 0.02 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.02 mol H2O.

So the total enthalpy change would be the sum of two parts:

1. The enthalpy from the precipitation reaction (H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O).

2. The enthalpy from the neutralization of the remaining H+ and OH-.

But wait, I don't have the enthalpy for the precipitation reaction. So this complicates things because I don't know the ΔH for that reaction. If the problem doesn't provide that, perhaps I should ignore it and proceed only with the neutralization of H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the neutralization, ignoring any precipitation.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure whether to include the precipitation reaction.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't expect me to consider the formation of BaSO4. Maybe it assumes all the H+ and OH- neutralize each other, regardless of any precipitates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total H+ and OH- without considering any precipitation, as the presence of Ba^2+ and SO4^2- may not form a precipitate under certain conditions, but that's beyond the scope of the problem.

Given that, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that all H+ and OH- neutralize, and the presence of Ba^2+ and SO4^2- doesn't form a precipitate, which might not be the case, but without more information, perhaps that's the way to go.

So, going back, the initial approach was correct. The total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. The limiting is OH-, so 0.2 mol neutralized, releasing 0.2 *57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. Which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But looking at the options, the closest is option B (-11.42 kcal) which is about 48.2 kJ, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the enthalpy in kcal.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.7 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.7). So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *13.7 ≈2.74 kcal. So that would be approximately -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, that's option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the enthalpy per mole is 57.3 kJ, which is about 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 2.74 kcal. So the total enthalpy change is -2.74 kcal. Which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). So perhaps option A is the correct answer.

But earlier I thought that the neutralization would be 0.2 moles, giving 11.46 kJ. But if the question expects the answer in kcal, then 11.46 kJ is about 2.737 kcal, which is about option A.

But wait, no, because 11.46 kJ is about 2.737 kcal. So that's why option A is -2.72 kcal. That makes sense.

Wait, but why would the problem present the options in both kJ and kcal? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the value of 3.80 kcal per mole of H+ neutralized. Because 0.2 moles would give 0.76 kcal, but that doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization as -57.3 kJ per mole of H2SO4 reacting. But that doesn't make sense because H2SO4 contributes two H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to sum the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole, but without considering the stoichiometric ratios. Wait, but that would be incorrect because the limiting reagent determines how much reacts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of neutralization is -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ reacted, and the total H+ reacted is 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is -2.737 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer would be -11.46 kJ, which isn't among the options. But if the problem expects the answer in kcal, then it's about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach is to consider that the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a separate reaction with its own enthalpy, and the HCl's H+ neutralizes any remaining OH-.

But without knowing the enthalpy of the precipitation reaction, I can't calculate that.

So, going back, the initial approach gives -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.737 kcal, which is closest to option A (-2.72 kcal). So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy to be calculated for each acid and base separately and then summed. Let me see.

For HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → neutralizes 0.1 mol OH- → enthalpy is 0.1 * (-57.3) = -5.73 kJ.

For H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+ → neutralizes 0.18 mol OH- → but available OH- is 0.2. So after HCl neutralizes 0.1, the remaining OH- is 0.1, which can neutralize 0.1 mol of H+. So from H2SO4's 0.18 H+, only 0.1 can react, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

So the total enthalpy would be:

HCl: 0.1 * (-57.3) = -5.73 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.1 * (-57.3) = -5.73 kJ.

Total: -11.46 kJ → approximately -2.737 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

So I think that's the approach. So the correct answer is option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid, monoprotic):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base, diprotic):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reactant
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react.

### Step 3: Calculate enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.7 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to kcal:  
\[
-11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.737 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.737 \, \text{kcal} \) is closest to option **A (-2.72 kcal)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
