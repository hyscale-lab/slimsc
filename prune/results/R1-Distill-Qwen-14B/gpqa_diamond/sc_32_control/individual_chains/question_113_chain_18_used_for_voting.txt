Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through each part. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad peak could mean that the compound has either an alcohol group (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid group. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more extensively. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, which also shows a broad peak but maybe not as broad as a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. I know 1700 is a typical region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, it could be due to a conjugated double bond, like an enone system. Or maybe an amide? But in this case, since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not amides. So, two carbonyl peaks. Wait, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, perhaps one is an ester and the other is from a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: several peaks are observed, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, so that suggests the molecule has some sort of double bond. Depending on the splitting, they could be part of an aromatic ring (like in a vinyl group attached to something else) or perhaps an isolated double bond. So the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR indicates a double bond somewhere in the structure.

Now, the Mass Spec: the fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments could give a mass of 45. Common fragments at m/z 45 include the methyl group attached to an oxygen, like CH3O+ (which is 31, though) or maybe a ketene ion or something else. Wait, 45 is also the mass for a CH3CO+ fragment. Because CH3CO+ is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 +16= 24 +3 +16=43? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, oxygen 16.

CH3CO+ would be (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*1)=24 +3 +16=43. Hmm, so 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like C3H7O or something else. Let's think: 45 would be, for example, CH3CH2CHO+ (but that's 45? Let's see: C=12, H=1, O=16. So CH2CH2CHO: that's more than 45. Maybe not. Wait, another possibility is the acylium ion, like R-CO- where the R is a group that would make the total 45. Alternatively, maybe a COO- group, but that might not give 45. Or perhaps a CH2CH2O group? Let me see, CH2CH2O would be (12*2)+(1*4)+(16)=24 +4 +16=44. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is also the mass for (CH3)2CHO+, because (CH3)2CH is 56, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Another thought: 45 could be the mass of a ketene ion, which is O=C=O- but that's O2C, which is 16*2 +12=44. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3COO- group. Wait, CH3COO- is 60 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59?), no, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the molecular ion of the compound may lose some groups, leading to the m/z 45 fragment. So what if the compound has an ester group? Because esters can fragment in certain ways. For example, in an ester's structure, like R-O-CO-R', the cleavage might break between the ester oxygen and the carbonyl, leading to a fragment. But I might be mixing up some mechanisms here.

Let me consider the possible molecular formulas again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O: (6*12)+(12)+(16)=72+12+16=100.

So, the molecular weight varies. The mass spectrum's fragment is at 45, which is less than all these molecular weights, so it's a fragment, likely a smaller piece breaking off.

Now, let's tie this together. Let's think about each option and see which fits the data.

Option B is C6H10O. Its molecular formula would be, for example, an alkene (since there are vinyl protons in NMR) and an alcohol (since IR has a broad peak). So, maybe a cyclohexene with an hydroxyl group. But wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks, so that might not fit because an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's a problem. So maybe option B is out because it doesn't account for the two carbonyl peaks.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak around 3000, which could be O-H, and two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650, which are likely carbonyls. So the compound must have at least two carbonyl groups? Or is it possible that one of those is something else?

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an ester group and the other is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a carbonyl in a conjugated system, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So looking at the options, which have oxygen counts that would allow for two oxygen-containing functional groups? Let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. That's two oxygen atoms. So possible functional groups could be an ester (which has two oxygen atoms) and maybe an alcohol, but that would require three oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone, but that would need more oxygen. Wait, no, ester is O-C-O, so that's two oxygen atoms. So if the molecule is an ester with another carbonyl group, it would have more oxygen. Hmm, but if the formula is C6H12O2, you can have an ester (which is O-C-O) and maybe another oxygen somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester? But then the molecular formula would have more oxygen. Wait, let me check the options. Option A is C6H12O2, which is two oxygen atoms. So a diester would have four oxygen atoms, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are from an ester and an aromatic ring. For example, if the compound is something like methyl benzoate, but that's C8H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6H... So perhaps something like cyclohexene with an ester group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactide, but that's a different structure.

Another approach: Let's look at the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. So 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygen atoms. That could be an ester plus perhaps another oxygen-containing group. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester or a substituted ester.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests double bonds. So the structure probably has a double bond. Let me think about the possible structures.

If the compound is an ester with a vinyl group, perhaps something like methyl vinyl benzoate? But benzoate would be more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester like a lactone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted ester with a double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. For example, if the compound is a diethyl ester, the fragment might break off an ethyl group. Wait, but the molecular weight is 116 (for option A, C6H12O2 is 116). If the fragment is 45, then the rest would be 71. Hmm, that doesn't immediately ring any bells.

Wait, another approach: in mass spectrometry, the most intense fragment is often the molecular ion. But in this case, it's a fragment, so maybe it's a characteristic fragment.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester, like ethyl propionate or something. But the formula would need to fit the options. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. But phenyl is C6H5, so phenyl acetate would be C6H5-O-CO-CH3. That would have the formula C8H8O2. But our options are C6, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl carbonate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, such as an ester and a ketone. But then the molecular formula would require more oxygen. Wait, perhaps it's a diketone? Oh, but the options don't have three oxygen atoms. Looking back, the options are:

A) C6H12O2 (two O)
B) C6H10O (one O)
C) C6H10O2 (two O)
D) C6H12O (one O)

So, the compound must have two oxygen atoms and a double bond, and an O-H group.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), but the presence of two carbonyls suggests that maybe it's a compound with both an alcohol and a carbonyl, but that would require three oxygen atoms, which is not the case for options A, C (which have two O atoms).

So perhaps the O-H is not an alcohol but a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid has two O atoms in the COOH group. Let me see: a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, so the formula would include two O in the COOH group. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with another carbonyl group, then the formula should have more O's. But looking at the options, the only option with two O's is A and C.

Wait, let me think. For a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two O's (like in COOH), but then if there's another carbonyl, like a ketone, the O count would be three. So that's not possible with options. So perhaps the O-H isn't a carboxylic acid.

Another possibility: the O-H is an alcohol. Then, the two carbonyls would be two separate groups. But that would require three O's, which the options don't have. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the two carbonyls are from a conjugated system. Like, maybe an ester and an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Wait, no, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups (the ketone and the ester). So for example, something like ethyl acetoacetate. The structure would have a ketone and an ester group. Let's check the formula. Acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOEt, but that would be more carbons. Alternatively, our compound is a beta-keto ester with six carbons. Let me count: the beta-keto ester would have a structure like RCOCH2COOR'. So for six carbons, perhaps R is methyl and R' is something else, but let's see.

Wait, the molecular formula for such a compound: Let's say it's ethyl (3-oxocyclohexyl) acetate or something. But maybe it's simpler. Let's think of the molecular formula for a beta-keto ester with six carbons. For example, ethyl 3-oxopentanoate would be CH2(CO)CH2COOEt. Wait, but that's more than six carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate. No, that's 7 carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the IR again. Two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone (conjugated ketone with a double bond). So maybe the structure has an enone system and an ester group.

So the molecular formula would need to have at least two carbonyl groups. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. So two oxygen atoms. So the structure could be an ester (which uses two O) and an enone (which adds another O?), but wait, no, because the enone is a double bond with a ketone, which uses one O. So that would require three O's, but the formula only has two. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, the two carbonyls are in the same group. Wait, maybe one is an ester and the other is a conjugated ketone within the same structure. Let me think about the molecular formula. For example, ethyl 3-oxopentanoate would have the formula C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. Like a lactone with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would fit the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyls are not both from esters or ketones. Maybe one is an ester and the other is an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but that might not give two strong peaks.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 cm-1 could be an ester, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with a substituent, like a carbonyl. For example, if the molecule is a methyl benzoate derivative, but benzoate is a benzene ring with a COO group. But the molecular formula for benzoate would be different.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ortho ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is due to an aromatic ring with conjugation, not a carbonyl. For example, aromatic rings with substituents that cause absorption around that region. For example, in an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups, the C=C stretching can be around 1600-1680 cm-1. So perhaps the 1650 peak is an aromatic ring, and the 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

So, in that case, the structure would have an aromatic ring (so the NMR would show aromatic protons, but wait the question says the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically deshielded and appear downfield, often as doublets or multiplets. If the structure has an aromatic ring, the protons would be in the aromatic region, say around 7 ppm. But the presence of vinyl protons suggests a non-aromatic double bond because aromatic protons are a different set of peaks. Wait, the question says the NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which are part of a double bond, but not necessarily aromatic. So maybe the structure has a double bond that isn't part of an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, the compound likely has an ester group (from 1700 cm-1), a conjugated double bond (from 1650 cm-1), and an O-H group (from the broad peak at 3000 cm-1). But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something, but that's probably not the case.

Another way to approach the problem: let's think about the possible molecular formula and the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's calculate possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10*1=10 + 2*16=32. Total: 114. The fragment at 45 would be a significant portion of the molecule. If the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45 and another part, then the other part would be 114-45=69.

What could give a fragment of 45? Let's think of possible functional groups. For example, a methyl ester group (CH3O) would be 31, but that's not 45. Alternatively, a fragment like (CH2)2CO+ would be (2*12)+(4*1)+(16)+(16)=24+4+32=60, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe a fragment with a carbonyl and a methyl group: like (CH3COO-) would be 60, but again, higher.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the acylium ion, which is R-C≡O(+), but I'm not sure how that would form. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ethereal oxygen, and upon fragmentation, a CH2CH2O group would be 44, which is close to 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propyl group attached to an oxygen, but 45 is a bit high for that.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment with the formula C3H7O. Let me check: 3 carbons would be 3*12=36, 7 H is 7, O is 16. 36+7+16=59. Not matching. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with more oxygen. For example, a carbonyl group with some substituents. Let's think: 45 could be CH3CO-O-R, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone fragment, like (CH3)2CO. (CH3)2CO is 58 (12*3 + 3*1 + 16). No, 58 is higher than 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2OCH3 group? Let's see: 2 carbons, 4 H, O, and CH3. 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 16+15 (CH3O is 31?) Wait, no, CH2CH2OCH3 would be (2*12)+(4)+(16+15)=24+4+31=59. Still not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me think of the molecular formula and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula could correspond to an ester with a cyclic structure or a diol ester. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted ester.

Wait, another thought: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the compound has a double bond, which would be consistent with an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such structures often show strong absorption around 1650 cm-1 due to conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl.

So, if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, that would explain the 1700 and 1650 cm-1 peaks. The ester carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (enone) would be around 1650.

Now, the O-H stretch in the IR would suggest an alcohol. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group, but that would require three oxygen atoms (ester has two O, alcohol has one), but the formula only has two oxygen atoms. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the O-H isn't an alcohol but something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal or some other structure, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group. But I don't see any indication of aromatic protons in the NMR data given in the question. The NMR data only mentions vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic ones.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each formula option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures include an ester with a double bond (alpha,beta-unsaturated) and perhaps a cyclic structure. For example, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. The structure would have an ester group, a double bond, and perhaps a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. This has two fewer hydrogens than option A. So, perhaps it's a diene, but I'm not sure.

The presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two carbonyl groups, which would require more oxygen. But in options A and C, there are two oxygen atoms, so maybe each O is part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, that would have one carbonyl group. So that doesn't fit the two peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: maybe one of the carbonyl groups is from a conjugated diene. For example, a dienone structure, which could have a conjugated double bond and a ketone, leading to a peak around 1650 cm-1.

But then, the formula would need to fit. Let's say the compound is a dienone. For example, 1,4-diketone, but that would require two ketone groups, needing two O's, which fits options A and C.

Wait, if the compound is a dienone, like cyclohexenone with another ketone somewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, making the two carbonyl peaks. But that would only account for one carbonyl group.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize the data again.

FTIR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm-1: likely O-H, maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid.

- 1700 cm-1: carbonyl, ester or ketone.

- 1650 cm-1: likely conjugated carbonyl (enone) or aromatic.

1H NMR: vinyl protons present.

Mass Spec: fragment at m/z=45.

So, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups (the keto and the ester), but that would require three O's, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: the O-H could be part of a hemiacetal, which doesn't require an additional O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of an ether, but that doesn't explain the broad peak.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of an acetal. No, that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is in a carboxylic acid, but then the formula would require another O for the COOH group. Let's see: if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH, which has two O's. So, for example, if it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would show O-H (broad), and the two carbonyl peaks could be from the acid (about 1700 cm-1) and perhaps a conjugated double bond (around 1650). But then, the molecular formula would have two O's, which fits option C (C6H10O2).

Wait, let me think. If the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, the structure might be something like CH2=CH(CH2)3COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2. Because:

The structure would be: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Let's count the carbons: 2 (from the double bond) +4 (from CH2CH2CH2) +2 (from COOH) =8? Wait, no, that's too many. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a shorter chain. Let me count again. The formula is C6H10O2. For a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. Wait, no, a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2 for n=1 (like formic acid, HCOOH: C=1, H=2, O=2). So for n=3, it would be C3H6O2. But our compound is C6H10O2, which is more than that.

Hmm, but maybe it's a six-carbon compound with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. Let me think: CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. No, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe it's cyclohexene carboxylic acid. So, a six-carbon ring with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. The formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene has 6 carbons, the acid adds another O but doesn't change the C count.

So, the structure would be cyclohex-1-ene carboxylic acid. Its formula is C6H10O2 (since cyclohexene is C6H10, adding the carboxylic acid group (COOH) adds two O's and doesn't change H much? Wait, let me count:

Cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a COOH group would replace a CH2 group with a COOH, so the formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene is C6H10. When you add COOH, which is -COOH (so -CH2- becomes -COOH, which changes the formula from CH2 (2 H) to COOH (two O's, but the H count would be (CH2: 2 H) → COOH: which has two O and the H? Wait, maybe I'm not getting the exact count right.

But let's say the formula is C6H10O2. So that fits option C.

Now, the FTIR: the broad peak around 3000 cm-1 would be the O-H of the carboxylic acid, which is very broad. The 1700 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm-1 could be the conjugated double bond in the cyclohexene ring. The NMR would show vinyl protons (from the double bond in the ring), which aligns with the data.

The mass spec fragment at m/z=45: in the case of a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, what would fragment? Maybe losing the COOH group as a fragment. Wait, the COOH group has a molecular weight of 44 (12+16+16+1=44?), wait, COOH is -COOH, which is (12+16*2 +1) = 45? Let me compute: C=12, O=16, H=1. So COOH is (12)+(16*2)+(1*2)=12+32+2=46. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like CH2CH2O+? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks off a smaller fragment. For example, if the cyclohexene part breaks into a smaller fragment. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the compound is not a carboxylic acid but an ester, let's think about that.

If the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's more carbons. Alternatively, methyl 3-oxopentenoate. Let me think about the formula.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, that's methyl propenoate. The formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6H..., so that's not matching.

Wait, but the options have six carbons. So perhaps the ester is something like cyclohexene-based. For example, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Wait, that would be ester group and a cyclohexene ring.

The formula would be C7H10O2, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the ester is part of the six-carbon chain. For example, ethyl 3-oxopentanoate. That would have the formula C6H10O2. Let me count: ethyl (C2H5O) + 3-oxopentanoate (C5H7O3) would give C7H12O4, which isn't matching. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula of each option and see which ones could have the functional groups indicated by the spectroscopic data.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation calculation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Two could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so at least one double bond. If it's a ring plus a double bond, that's two degrees. Alternatively, two double bonds.

But the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks. So, perhaps two double bonds, one being part of a carbonyl group. For example, an ester (one double bond from the carbonyl) and another double bond elsewhere (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have another double bond conjugated to the carbonyl).

So, in that case, the structure would have two double bonds: one in the ester carbonyl and another conjugated to it.

Wait, but how would that fit the formula?

Wait, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. That would be longer than six carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester group and a conjugated double bond. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

The FTIR suggests two carbonyl groups. So the compound must have two carbonyl groups. Therefore, the options must have two oxygen atoms, which are both part of carbonyl groups.

Wait, that's only possible if the compound is a ketone and an ester. But that would require three oxygen atoms because a ketone has one O and an ester has two O. So the formula would need three O's, but the options only have two. Hmm, so that's a conflict.

Wait, but maybe one of the oxygen atoms is shared between the two carbonyls. Like in a cyclic structure where the same oxygen is part of both carbonyls. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aromatic ring with substituents. But that doesn't really make sense.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has an ester group (which contributes to one carbonyl) and a conjugated double bond (which doesn't contribute to a carbonyl but could absorb around 1650 cm-1). Then, the two carbonyl peaks would be the ester and something else, but I'm not sure what. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring.

But the question says the unknown has two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. So both are carbonyls?

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me approach this differently.

Looking at the mass spec, the fragment at 45. Let's think of possible groups that could give that.

45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion), but acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), which is 44. Close, but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3COO+ fragment, which is 60. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a propyl group attached to an oxygen. For example, (CH2)2COH+? No, that would be more than 45. Alternatively, perhaps a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like CH3O+ (31), but that's lower than 45.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment with the formula C3H7O. Let me calculate: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. So that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps a fragment with formula C2H5O2. 2*12=24, 5=5, 32=32. 24+5+32=61. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl fragment. For example, a fragment with a carbonyl and a methyl group: CH3CO+. That's 43, which is close to 45 but not matching. Alternatively, maybe a fragment with a carbonyl and another group.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O fragment, but that's 44. Still not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen. Not sure.

This is getting too time-consuming, but I'll try to proceed.

So, the options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight 116.

B) C6H10O: 98.

C) C6H10O2: 114.

D) C6H12O: 100.

The fragment is at 45, which is about 40% of the molecular weight for option C (45 is about 40% of 114), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in mass spectrometry, the most common fragments are often the most stable, like the acylium ion (R-CO+), which is common in esters. So, if the fragment is 45, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the molecular ion is 114 (option C), losing a 69 fragment would leave 45. But I'm not sure what 69 would correspond to.

Wait, 69 is the molecular weight of something like 1,3-dioxolane or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in esters. The McLafferty rearrangement can produce a fragment that's about 45. For example, in some esters, the rearrangement leads to a fragment with a carbonyl and some substituents. So, the McLafferty rearrangement could produce a fragment with a mass of 45.

So, if the compound is an ester with a gamma hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon next to the carbonyl), it can undergo McLafferty rearrangement, leading to a fragment with a mass of 45.

For example, in ethyl 3-oxopentanoate, the McLafferty rearrangement would produce a fragment with a carbonyl group and a propyl chain, leading to a fragment of 45.

But the molecular formula in that case would be C6H10O2 (if the ester is ethyl something), which matches option C.

Putting it all together:

- FTIR shows O-H (broad peak), and two carbonyls (1700 and 1650 cm-1). The O-H could be part of an ester (but that's not likely) or maybe a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a beta-keto ester, but that requires three O's.

Wait, perhaps the O-H isn't present. Wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the compound must have an O-H group. So, it's either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid.

But earlier analysis suggests that for the two carbonyl peaks, it's more likely an ester and a conjugated system. So, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto ester, but that would require three O's.

Wait, but option C has two O's. So perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. Like a lactone with a double bond. But then, where would the O-H come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal, but that's getting too complicated.

Another angle: let's think about the possible molecular formula and the presence of vinyl protons in NMR. The presence of vinyl protons suggests a non-aromatic double bond, so perhaps the structure includes a double bond that's part of an ester group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Alpha,beta-unsaturated esters have strong absorption around 1700 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl and around 1650 cm-1 for the conjugated double bond. So that fits the IR data.

The O-H in the IR would then come from an alcohol group, which would require another O. But in the options, only options A and C have two O's.

So, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group, that would require three O's, but the options don't have that. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is part of the ester group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a geminal diol, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is not from an alcohol but from a phenol group. But then, the NMR would show aromatic protons, which aren't mentioned.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to go back to the beginning.

The given data:

- IR: broad O-H (probably alcohol or carboxylic acid), two carbonyls (1700 and 1650). So, two carbonyl groups.

- NMR: vinyl hydrogens present.

- Mass Spec: fragment at 45.

So, the compound has two carbonyl groups. So, the formula must have at least two oxygen atoms, each part of a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Two O's. So, each O could be part of a carbonyl, perhaps as an ester and a ketone. But that would require three O's, which isn't the case here.

Wait, no. An ester has two O's in the structure (O-C-O). So, the two O's are part of the ester group. If the compound is an ester with another carbonyl group, that would require three O's, which isn't possible. So option A can't have two carbonyls because it only has two O's. So that's a problem.

Similarly, option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. So, if it's an ester (two O's), where is the second carbonyl? It would require another O, which isn't present. So, this is a problem.

Hmm. So this suggests that perhaps the two carbonyl groups are part of the same O. Wait, that's not possible. Unless one is an aromatic carbonyl, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps one of the carbonyls is a ketone and the other is an ester, but that requires three O's, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone ester, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is a conjugated C=O, and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C. But then, the 1650 peak would be from the aromatic ring, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is from an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so that's not possible.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the two carbonyls might not both be present in the same molecule. For example, perhaps one is a carbonyl from an ester and the other is from a carboxylic acid. But that would require three O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR data is misinterpreted. Maybe the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring. Then, the two carbonyls would only be the ester. But the question says the FTIR shows two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are both carbonyls. So that can't be.

I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again and their molecular weights.

Option C is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114.

If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, let's say methyl acrylate. But methyl acrylate is C4H6O2, which is too small. Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like methyl 3-oxopentenoate. Wait, methyl 3-oxopentenoate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C5H6O2, which is smaller than our options.

Wait, but our compound is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a ring. Like, for example, cyclohexene-based.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has a ring and a double bond, that fits with the NMR showing vinyl protons (double bond) and perhaps an aromatic ring, but the question doesn't mention aromatic protons.

Alternatively, the two double bonds could be in the structure, like in an ester with a conjugated double bond.

But I'm not getting closer.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess. Let's consider the options again.

The presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two carbonyl groups. The only way to fit that with the given options is if one of the O's is part of two carbonyls, which isn't possible. So perhaps the two carbonyl peaks are from the same group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is a conjugated carbonyl, not a separate group. For example, an ester with a conjugated double bond. So, only one carbonyl group (ester) but the conjugated system absorbs at 1650. So, the 1700 is the ester, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond. But then, why two strong peaks?

Hmm. I'm really not sure, but looking at the options, I think option C (C6H10O2) is the most likely, as it has two O's which could be part of an ester and a conjugated system, and the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. The mass spec fragment at 45 could correspond to a fragment from the ester group. Additionally, the molecular formula fits with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the two IR peaks.

So, I'll go with option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The key observations and analysis are as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
1. **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
2. **Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹**: These are characteristic of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group (e.g., ester or ketone), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This suggests a characteristic fragment of the compound, likely involving a carbonyl group and a small substituent.

### Molecular Formula Options:
The options provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:
   - Two oxygen atoms are present, which could correspond to an ester group (O-C-O) and possibly another oxygen-containing functional group.
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 2, indicating one ring and/or one double bond.
   - However, the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups, which would require three oxygen atoms, making this option less likely.

2. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:
   - Only one oxygen atom is present, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

3. **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:
   - Two oxygen atoms are present, which could correspond to an ester group (O-C-O) and a conjugated carbonyl group.
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 2, consistent with a structure containing one ring and one double bond or two double bonds.
   - The IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ can be explained by an ester carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respectively.
   - The ¹H NMR data aligns with the presence of vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with a fragment from an ester group.

4. **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:
   - Only one oxygen atom is present, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR, and the fragment at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrometry data.
