Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitudes of each star and see which ones are bright enough for both instruments.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that's apparent V magnitude <=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and if it's <=16, HIRES can see it. But wait, no, wait—wait, the problem says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. But wait, wait—apparent magnitude works so that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is more than 17 mag, it's too faint for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, anything brighter than 16 mag is observable. So, stars with apparent V mag <=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO, and those <=16 can be observed by HIRES. So a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So the star needs to be at most 16 mag in V.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. If a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, then it can be seen by ESPRESSO. So apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So if a star is 17 mag, it's exactly at the limit for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, the limit is brighter than 16. So apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16.

So a star that is <=16 mag can be detected by both. Because if it's <=16, then it's brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, and also brighter than 16 (or exactly 16) for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag must be less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, it must be less than 16. So the star must be bright enough to be observed by both. So the apparent V must be less than both 17 and 16? No, wait no. Because for both instruments, the star needs to be within their detectable range. So for the star to be detected by both, it must be <=16 (since that's the lower limit for HIRES) because if it's <=16, then it's definitely within ESPRESSO's limit (since 16 is less than 17). So any star with apparent V mag <=16 can be detected by both. But wait, wait, no—no, I think I got this backwards. Because the magnitude scale is inverse, right? So a lower apparent magnitude is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V mag is less than 17, then ESPRESSO can see it. If it's brighter than 16, meaning less than 16, then HIRES can see it.

Wait, no, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star's apparent V mag is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, a star with 15 mag is definitely brighter than 17. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V must be fainter than 17 (so <=17) for ESPRESSO, and fainter than 16 (so <=16) for HIRES. Wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me read again: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17 is observable. For HIRES, apparent V ≤16 is observable. So to be observed by both, the star must have apparent V ≤16. Because if it's ≤16, then it's within both's limits. Because 16 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, and HIRES can see up to 16.

Wait, but wait—if a star's apparent V is 16, then for ESPRESSO, it's brighter than 17? No, wait, 16 is less than 17, so it's brighter. So yes, a 16 mag star is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. And it's exactly at the limit for HIRES (since it's brighter than 16 mag means 16.0? Or is it 16.0 is the limit? The question says "brighter than 16.5 mag can be observed." Wait, no, the question says for HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16 V mag. So anything with V mag ≤16 can be observed. Because if it's brighter than 16, then its magnitude is less than 16. So, for example, a star with V=15 is brighter than 16, so HIRES can see it. A star with V=16.0 is exactly at the limit—if the limit is "brighter than 16", then 16.0 is not included. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, magnitude scale is tricky. "Brighter than 16 V mag" would mean apparent V mag less than 16. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with apparent V mag of 15 is brighter than 16, so it can be observed. A star with V=16.5 can't. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V must be ≤16, because:

- ESPRESSO: V ≤17 → can observe.
- HIRES: V ≤16 → can observe.

So, any star with V ≤16 can be seen by both. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes given, or apparent, so I'll need to compute each star's apparent magnitude.

Let me list all the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.
Star2: Apparent V 16.5, distance 5 pc.
Star3: Apparent V 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. Also, located at 15 pc.
Star4: Absolute V 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.
Star5: Absolute V 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, but Star2: it's already given as apparent V=16.5. So for Star2, apparent V is 16.5. So HIRES can't observe it because HIRES requires V mag ≤16. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 <17. So Star2 can be observed only by ESPRESSO, not both.

Hmm, but wait, Star2's apparent V is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, it's okay. But for HIRES, it's over the limit (16.5 >16), so HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be observed by both.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc. Let's compute its apparent V. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star5: M =16.5, d=5.

m = 16.5 +5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 +5 * log10(0.5) → log10(0.5) is -0.3010.

So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

So m =16.5 -1.505 = 14.995 ≈ 15.0 mag.

So apparent V is about 15.0 mag. That's less than 16, so both can observe.

Star5 is a candidate.

Star1: absolute V is15.5, distance 10 pc.

m =15.5 +5 * log10(10/10) =15.5 +5*0=15.5. So apparent V is15.5. Which is ≤16. So both can observe.

Star1 is a candidate.

Star4: absolute V 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

First, compute apparent V without extinction. Then apply the extinction.

Apparent V before extinction: m =15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

Extinction in V band: A_V =3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag.

So observed apparent V is m_observed = m + A_V → 15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, is extinction adding to the apparent magnitude? Because extinction (dust) makes stars appear fainter, so m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because higher apparent magnitude is fainter. So if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and extinction adds 1.24, the observed m is 16.74, which is beyond 16. So for HIRES, which requires m ≤16, this star would have m=16.74 → can't be observed by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can, as 16.74 <17. So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

Wait, no: Wait, for Star3, it's given as apparent V magnitude 15.5, but also has extinction E(B-V)=0.6. Hmm, does that mean that the apparent magnitude has already been corrected for extinction? Or is the given apparent magnitude the observed (extincted) magnitude?

Wait, this is a point of confusion. The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but with E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the 15.5 is the observed (extincted) magnitude. So to find the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we need to correct for extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. The star's absolute magnitude is a measure of its intrinsic brightness. But the apparent magnitude is what we observe through the interstellar medium. So when we have extinction, the apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than it actually is. So if a star's intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is m0, then m_observed = m0 + A_V.

But in this case, Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So is that the observed m, and we're to find the intrinsic m? Or is the given m already corrected?

Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So, the note says that A_V =3.1 * E(B-V). So E(B-V) is 0.6 → A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the observed (apparent) V magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_V. So m_true = m_obs - A_V → m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64 mag.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true = m_observed - A_V, because the extinction makes it appear fainter. So if a star's light is dimmed, its apparent magnitude increases.

So if m_observed =15.5, then m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the star's actual brightness is 13.64, but due to dust, it appears dimmer at 15.5.

But wait, why do I need the intrinsic apparent magnitude here? Because I'm trying to see if the star is bright enough. But the star's apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5, so that's what matters for the instrument's capability.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the problem is about whether the instrument can detect the star. Since the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so HIRES can detect it (since it's ≤16). And ESPRESSO can as well. So Star3 has apparent V of 15.5, so both can observe. But wait, no, wait: no, wait. Wait, the star has an apparent V, but is that affected by extinction? The given is that the star's apparent V is 15.5, but it's affected by extinction. So the actual observed magnitude is 15.5, which is correct.

Wait, but no, wait. No, wait, the way extinction works: the observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than the true magnitude. So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is 15.5 - A_V, which is 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. But the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So from the Earth's perspective, the star appears at 15.5 mag.

So when considering whether the instrument can detect it, it's the observed apparent magnitude that matters. So the observed V is 15.5, so both instruments can detect it.

Wait, but wait, no: the problem says that HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 V mag. So if the observed V is 15.5, which is ≤16, so HIRES can. And ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so yes.

So Star3: apparent V=15.5. So both can observe.

Wait, but that's the observed apparent V, right? Because the star is dimmed by extinction, but the observed magnitude is 15.5. So Star3 is within both's detection limits.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem gives Star3's apparent V as 15.5, and E(B-V) as 0.6. So the total extinction A_V is 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But the observed magnitude is 15.5. So when the question says, "can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and the HIRES spectrograph," the detection depends on the observed apparent magnitude.

So for Star3, observed m is 15.5, which is within both's limits. So both can detect.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If the star's apparent V is 15.5 (observed), then HIRES can detect it (since it's ≤16). And ESPRESSO can as well. So Star3 is a candidate.

Similarly, Star5's apparent V is about 15.0, which is within both's limits.

Wait, but let's go back. So which stars have apparent V mag ≤16?

Let me list each star:

Star1: apparent V=15.5 → yes for both.

Star2: apparent V=16.5 → HIRES can't, only ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent V=15.5 → yes for both.

Star4: after extinction, apparent V=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: apparent V=15.0 → yes for both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5 → no, Star4 can't be, since it's 16.74.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes, both are within both's limits.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5, can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be.

Wait, but let me double-check Star1 and Star4.

Star1: absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So m = M +5 log10 (d/10) → 15.5 +5*(1) → 20.5? Wait, wait no, wait.

Wait, no. The formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Because M is absolute magnitude (d=10 pc), so m = M +5 (log10(d) -1).

Wait, let me correct this. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d / 10 pc) → same as M +5(log10(d) -1).

So for Star1, d=10 pc:

log10(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 +5*(0)=15.5. So apparent V is15.5. So both can detect.

Star4: absolute V=15.5, d=10 pc. So m (without extinction) is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So observed m =15.5 +1.24=16.74 → greater than 16, so HIRES can't.

So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but the options are:

Looking at the options, the possible correct pairs are:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → no, Star4 can't.

Wait, but wait, let's see the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't, so no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both instruments.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't, Star3 can.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake with Star5?

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) → 16.5 +5*(log10(0.5)) → log10(0.5)=−0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)=−1.505. So m=16.5−1.505=14.995≈15.0 mag.

So m=15.0, which is ≤16. So both can detect.

So Star5 is a candidate.

So the stars that are detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0). So among the options, only B and D have two stars. Let me look:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. The ESPRESSO spectrograph can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., ≤17), while the HIRES spectrograph can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., ≤16). A star must therefore have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent V = 15.5 mag, which is ≤16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)  
   - Apparent V = 16.5 mag, which is >16.  
   - **Not detectable by HIRES, only detectable by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
     \]  
   - However, the question specifies the apparent V magnitude as 15.5 mag, which is already corrected for extinction.  
   - Apparent V = 15.5 mag, which is ≤16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude (without extinction):  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Apparent V = 16.74 mag, which is >16.  
   - **Not detectable by HIRES, only detectable by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 \times (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent V = 15.0 mag, which is ≤16.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Option B (Star3 and Star5)** is correct.

**Answer: B**
