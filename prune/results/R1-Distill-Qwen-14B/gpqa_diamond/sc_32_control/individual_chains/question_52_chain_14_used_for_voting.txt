Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. The transition wavelength between these levels is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV range. Since the problem mentions LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I think we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) and E is the energy. But wait, the energy difference can be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the transition. The energy E is related to the photon's energy via E = hc/λ.

Wait, but what's the exact formula between the ratio and temperature? Oh right, since E2 is higher than E1 (because photons are emitted when going from higher to lower energy), so E1 < E2. So the ratio n1/n2 would be proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(kT) ), which is the same as exp(ΔE/(kT)) but since ΔE is negative, maybe I should think in terms of E2-E1.

Wait, I think the correct equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

So if I'm looking at the ratio n1/n2, that would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ).

But the question states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. Let me see why.

Because when temperature decreases, the exponential term in the Boltzmann factor would decrease. Because E2-E1 is a positive value, so dividing by a lower T would make the exponent larger. Wait, no: If T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would decrease if the exponent is negative? Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about it. The energy difference E2 - E1 is positive because E2 is higher. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would be a positive number greater than 1 when E2>E1 and T is positive. So when T decreases, E2-E1 over kT increases, so the exponential increases. So n2/n1 increases when T decreases. Wait, but the ratio n1/n2 is inverse of that. So if n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement: when spots are present (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

So the ratio when spots are absent (T1=6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

When spots are present, the T is T2=5500 K, so R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

We are to find the factor by which R1/R2 changes. So the factor is (R1)/(R2) = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Hmm, let me compute that. Let me denote ΔE = E2-E1 = hc/λ.

So the exponent is (hc/(λ k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value. Let's plug in the numbers.

First, find hc/(λ k).

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc/λ = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Then, hc/(λ k) = (1.373e-18 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) = approximately 9.956e4 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5.

1.373 / 1.38 is approximately 0.995, so ~0.995e5 = 9.95e4 K.

So approximately 10^5 K.

So (hc/(λ k)) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) where T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1

Difference: 1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is (1e5 K) * (1.515e-5 K^-1) ) = 1.515.

So exponent is approximately 1.515.

Therefore, the factor (R1/R2) is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

What is e^1.515? Let me think: e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^1.515 is a bit more.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

We know that ln(5) is about 1.609, so 1.515 is less than that.

Alternatively, I can compute e^1.515.

Let me break it down:

We know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

What's e^0.015? Approximately 1.0151.

So e^1.515 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.55.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, 1.609 is ln(5), so 1.515 is about 1.609 minus 0.094.

So e^1.515 = e^(1.609 - 0.094) )= e^(ln(5)) * e^(-0.094) )= 5 * e^(-0.094).

e^(-0.094) is approximately 1 - 0.094 + (0.094^2)/2 - ... ≈ approx 0.910.

So 5 * 0.910 ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55.

Wait, but let me check calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, earlier I calculated hc/(λ k) as approximately 9.95e4 K, which is about 1e5 K.

Then, 1/T1 is 1/6000 = 0.000166667 K^-1

1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by (hc/(λk)) which is 9.95e4 K.

So 9.95e4 * 0.000015151 = 9.95e4 * 1.5151e-5.

Calculating that: 9.95e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.95 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.95 * 1.5151:

9.95 * 1.5 = 14.925

9.95 * 0.0151 = approx 0.1502

So total around 15.075. Multiply by 0.1 (since 1e-1), gives 1.5075.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5075.

So e^1.5075 ≈ ?

e^1.5 is 4.4817.

e^1.5075 is e^(1.5 + 0.0075) )= e^1.5 * e^0.0075.

e^0.0075 ≈ 1 + 0.0075 + (0.0075^2)/2 ≈ 1.0075 + 0.000028 ≈ 1.007528.

So 4.4817 * 1.0075 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0075.

Let me compute this: 4.4817 * 1 =4.4817, 4.4817 *0.0075= 0.03361275. Sum is ~4.5153.

So about 4.515.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.5, which is very close. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check all steps.

Wait, the factor is R1/R2. Since when spots are present, the ratio decreases, so R1 is bigger than R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

In the calculation, the exponent is positive, so e^1.5 is ~4.5, which matches option C.

So the factor is about 4.5. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the given conditions. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1 = \Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The transition wavelength corresponds to \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
The energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Dividing by Boltzmann's constant (\(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The effective temperatures are \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots present). The difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (9.95 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.5075.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the ratio
The ratio of the Ti level populations when the star has no spots to when it has spots is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right) = \exp(1.5075).
\]

Using \(e^{1.5} \approx 4.4817\) and \(e^{0.0075} \approx 1.0075\), we find:

\[
\exp(1.5075) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio decreases when the star has spots is approximately **4.5**.
