Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with cyanide, I remember that the cyanide ion is a nucleophile. Oh wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, when NaCN is added to a ketone, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be a nitrile group attached to a carbon that's also bearing a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups. So, the ketone (butan-2-one) would have the carbonyl group. When NaCN (a source of CN-) adds to the carbonyl, it would form an intermediate. But then, what happens next?

Wait, but after addition, usually in such reactions, you might have a proton source to protonate the oxygen. But the product here has a hydroxyl group. Oh, right, the addition of HCN to the ketone would form a cyanohydrin. So the mechanism would be: the ketone attacks the CN-, forming an intermediate which then gets protonated to give the cyanohydrin.

But wait, NaCN is a strong base, so maybe the workup is important. Oh, I think when you add a ketone and NaCN, you might need an acid workup. Because the initial addition gives an alkoxide, which after adding acid would protonate to form the alcohol.

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN in a solvent like water or maybe in a reaction where it's adding, and then acid is added. So reagent A is probably H3O+ or another acid, like HCl or H2SO4.

Looking at the product, the hydroxyl and nitrile are on the same carbon as the ketone was. So the reagent A helps in the protonation, so that the product is formed.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the structure of the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. And the product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. So, the reaction is converting a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, like with HCl, H2O, heat, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis to form an amide first, then a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a saponification or something else, but the product here is a carboxylic acid, so it's more likely an acidic hydrolysis.

But wait, the reagent B is just H2O, but that can't be right. Or is B the other reagent? Let me reread the question. Oh, the second reaction is written as: [compound] + B (H2O) --> product. So, H2O is the solvent or part of the reagent. But in the options, the reagents are A and B, so B is one of the reagents, which might be an acid or something else.

Wait, in the second reaction, the starting material has a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you have to do that without affecting the hydroxyl group. But wait, the hydroxyl group is in the same position, so maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile under specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an oxidation. Wait, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. But what oxidizing agents are used for that? For example, KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents. But looking at the reagents in the options, I don't see KMnO4. So perhaps it's hydrolysis.

So, the reagent B would be an acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4. So in the second reaction, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid with the help of an acid.

Wait, but if the product is a carboxylic acid, then the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. So reagent B is probably a strong acid like HCl, which would help in the hydrolysis.

Now, looking back at the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, the usual conditions are NaCN in a basic solution, but after that, perhaps an acid workup is needed. So if A is H3O+, that makes sense for protonating the alkoxide to give the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, if A were NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3-, but I'm not sure how that would fit in. Wait, maybe it's another possibility. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN as the nucleophile. But in this case, NaCN would provide CN-.

Wait, but for the formation of the cyanohydrin, I think you need an acid workup. So if reagent A is H3O+, that would protonate the alkoxide to form the alcohol. So in the first reaction, A should be H3O+.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH.

Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl.

Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, so options A or B.

For the second reaction, B must be an acid for hydrolysis. So which acid? HCl is a strong acid, which would be better for hydrolysis. CH3COOH is a weak acid. But for efficient hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, a strong acid is better. Like HCl and heat.

So in the second reaction, B should be HCl (option A or C). But wait, in option A, B is HCl, which would fit. Option C has A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about.

So, putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A or B), the second uses HCl (so A or C).

So the correct option would be option A, which has A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Wait, but what about the second step? Let me think again. The reaction is:

Nitrile → carboxylic acid.

In acidic conditions, the hydrolysis of nitrile would proceed via the formation of an amide and then a carboxylic acid.

So the reagents would be H2O and HCl (acid).

So yes, B is HCl.

So the correct option is A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin intermediate. To protonate the alkoxide and yield the hydroxyl-containing product, an acidic workup is required. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid, which typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is more suitable for this hydrolysis compared to CH₃COOH (a weak acid).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This fits both reactions: H₃O⁺ for the first reaction and HCl for the second reaction.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is not suitable for efficient nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic workup for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
