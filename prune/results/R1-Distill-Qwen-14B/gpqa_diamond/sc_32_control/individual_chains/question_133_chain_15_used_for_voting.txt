Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think I should convert to liters because molarity uses liters. So 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters.

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, right, so I'll need to calculate the moles of each of these compounds.

Wait, but what are these compounds? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, I think. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So both are phosphate salts, but with different counterions and different hydrogen phosphate forms.

The question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But phosphate ions can have different forms depending on the pH. So I think this problem is about finding [PO4^3-], which is the orthophosphate ion concentration.

The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and each deprotonation has its own Ka.

I remember that in solution, phosphate species can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The form depends on the pH. Since we're dealing with the salts KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, the solution must be in a buffer region where these species are present.

So, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, they form a buffer. The phosphate buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the second ionization (Ka2) is relevant here.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's going to be deprotonated. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify.

Orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it's H2PO4^- (the first dissociation), then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So let's see what each of them contributes. KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the main phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The presence of both will set up a buffer between the second and third dissociations. Because when you have a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), that's a buffer situation.

So the buffer equation is based on Ka2. The Ka for the second dissociation is 6.2e-8. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might come into play here.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3- (from the third dissociation). But if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very low. Because PO4^3- is the third deprotonation, and the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the solution is probably in a region where HPO4^2- is the dominant species, and H2PO4^- is present as well. But the PO4^3- concentration is minimal.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing KH2PO4 (H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (HPO4^2-), which form a buffer. The phosphate ions in solution would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; but the question is about orthophosphate, which is H3PO4. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and will dissociate. So the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) would be the third dissociation product.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's not stable; it dissociates. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal, but perhaps in this solution, because of the buffer, we can calculate it using the third Ka.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that it's a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? But no, because the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the dominant species are these two.

Wait, perhaps the orthophosphate in this context refers to HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? I'm not entirely sure, but the question says 'orthophosphate ions', which I think refers to PO4^3-.

So, to find [PO4^3-], we have to consider the third dissociation step.

Wait, but maybe the solution is such that the phosphate exists mainly as H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very small, determined by the third dissociation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

3. Use the Ka2 and Ka3 expressions to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but how? Because the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by that buffer. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). Once we have the pH, we can determine the concentrations of all phosphate species, including PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the concentrations of each species using the buffer equation and then considering the third dissociation.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00560 mol.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

1. For KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.00734 mol.

2. For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 → Let's calculate. 177.99 is 177.99 g/mol. 1 / 177.99 is approx 0.005603 mol.

So, in solution, we have 0.00734 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005603 moles of HPO4^2-.

The solution volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005603 / 0.2 = 0.028015 M.

Now, using the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch):

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → which is about 7.207.

Wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028015 / 0.0367).

Calculate the ratio: 0.028015 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

But wait, the pH is 7.09. Now, with this pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But wait, we know [HPO4^2-], and [H+] can be found from the pH.

pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028015) / (8.21e-8).

Let me compute that.

(1.8e-12) * 0.028015 = (1.8 * 0.028015) e-12 ≈ 0.050427e-12 = 5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.21) e-6 ≈ 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but that's about 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option B is 5.48e-7, etc.

Wait, but wait a minute, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate step by step.

Compute [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M.

[H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So plug in:

(1.8e-12) * 0.028015 = (1.8 * 0.028015) * 1e-12.

1.8 * 0.028015 is approximately 0.050427.

So that's 0.050427e-12 = 5.0427e-14.

Divide by [H+] which is 8.21e-8:

5.0427e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.21) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.614 * 1e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.14e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

But wait, perhaps my approximation of [H+] is a bit rough. Let me compute [H+] more accurately.

pH = 7.092 → [H+] = 10^-7.092.

Compute 10^-7.092:

Since 10^0.092 = approx 1.23 (since 10^0.07918 is ~1.2, and 0.092 is a bit higher. Alternatively, 10^0.091 is about 1.23.

Wait, 10^0.092 ≈ 1.23.

Wait, 10^7 is 1e7. 10^0.092 is about 1.23? Let me compute more accurately.

Using logarithm tables or a calculator approach:

log(1.23) ≈ 0.0899. Hmm, so 10^0.092 would be a little higher. Let me approximate.

Alternatively, 10^0.092 ≈ 1.23 (since 10^0.07918 is 1.2, and 0.092 is a bit higher, so maybe around 1.23).

So 10^-7.092 = 10^(-7 - 0.092) )= 1e-7 * 10^-0.092 ≈ 1e-7 * (1/1.23) ≈ 8.13e-8.

So [H+] ≈ 8.13e-8.

So recalculating [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.13e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.

Divided by 8.13e-8: 5.0427e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.0427 / 8.13 ) * 1e-6.

5.0427 / 8.13 ≈ 0.6197.

So 0.6197e-6 → 6.197e-7 M.

Which is about 6.20e-7. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the moles.

Moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol → let me compute that accurately.

136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1 / 136.09 = 0.007339 mol → approximately 0.007339.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 → 1/177.99 is 0.005603 mol.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007339 / 0.2 = 0.036695 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005603 / 0.2 = 0.028015 M.

Yes, that's correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is 7.207.

Ratio is 0.028015 / 0.036695 = approx 0.764.

Log(0.764) → let me compute more accurately.

Log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.75)= -0.1249.

0.764 is about 0.76, so log(0.76)= approximately -0.118.

So pH is 7.207 - 0.118 = 7.089.

So [H+] is 10^-7.089.

10^-7.089 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.089) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.827 → 8.27e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / 8.27e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.27e-8: 5.0427e-14 /8.27e-8 = (5.0427 /8.27 )e-6.

5.0427 /8.27 ≈ 0.609.

So 0.609e-6 → 6.09e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.09e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But perhaps there's a more precise calculation needed.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio more accurately.

The ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028015 / 0.036695.

Let me compute that accurately.

0.028015 /0.036695 = approximately 0.764.

But let me compute it precisely.

Divide 0.028015 by 0.036695.

0.028015 ÷ 0.036695 ≈ 0.764.

But maybe it's better to compute it as 28015 / 36695.

Wait, 28015 ÷ 36695.

Well, 36695 × 0.764 = 36695 * 0.7=25686.5; 36695 * 0.06=2201.7; 36695 * 0.004=146.78.

So 25686.5 +2201.7=27888.2 +146.78=28034.98.

That's very close to 28015, which is the numerator.

So the ratio is approximately 0.764, as I thought.

So log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

Wait, using a calculator, log(0.764) is:

Let me recall that log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.76)= log(7.6e-1) = log(7.6) -1 ≈ 0.8808 -1 = -0.1192.

So log(0.764) is about -0.115? Or wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using the formula for log(1+x) where x is small.

But perhaps it's better to accept that the ratio is approximately 0.764 and log(0.764)= -0.115.

So pH is 7.207 -0.115=7.092.

Wait, but previously when I calculated [H+], I used 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8.

So [H+] is 8.21e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / 8.21e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8 → 5.0427e-14 /8.21e-8 = (5.0427 /8.21) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.614 * 1e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.14e-7 M, which is about 6.14 x10^-7.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, B is 5.48e-7, C is 2.81e-7.

So the closest is option A.

Wait, but why is the answer not exactly matching option A? Did I make a mistake in the buffer calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by their ratio. Then, using that pH, the [H+] is known. Then, the PO4^3- concentration comes from the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all species in the solution. Let me think about the overall reaction.

In solution, the phosphate species are:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

We have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, so the pH is determined by their ratio via the buffer equation.

As before, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) → pH = 7.207 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.207 -0.115 =7.092.

So [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, for the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Plugging in the values:

Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028015 M, [H+]=8.21e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) /8.21e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028015 = (1.8 *0.028015) e-12 =0.050427e-12=5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8 → 5.0427e-14 /8.21e-8 = (5.0427/8.21) *1e-6.

5.0427 /8.21 → approximately 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 =6.14e-7 M.

Which is about 6.14e-7 M. The closest option is A: 6.24e-7.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact ratio.

Let me compute 5.0427 /8.21 → 5.0427 ÷8.21.

5.0427 /8.21 → 8.21 × 0.614 is about 5.0427.

Yes.

So the concentration is approximately 6.14e-7 M. Since option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Perhaps I made some rounding errors.

But why is the answer not matching exactly? Let me check the initial moles again.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 /136.09 → 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 → 0.005603 mol.

Wait, 177.99 is the molecular weight of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Yes, so that's correct.

So concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] =0.028015 M.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately the ratio and the pH.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the exact pH using precise numbers.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207.

Ratio is 0.028015 /0.0367 → let me compute it accurately.

0.028015 /0.0367 = approximately 0.7644.

Log(0.7644) → Let me use a calculator approach.

Log(0.7644) = log(764.4e-3) = log(764.4) -3.

Log(764.4) → since log(700)=2.8451, log(764.4)=2.8838 (because 10^2.88=764.4, perhaps? Let me check:

10^0.88 = approx 7.65, so 10^2.88=7.65e2=765. So 764.4 is about 2.883.

So log(764.4)=2.8838.

So log(0.7644)=2.8838 -3 = -0.1162.

So pH=7.207 -0.1162=7.0908.

So [H+]=10^-7.0908.

10^-7.0908 = 1e-7 *10^(-0.0908).

10^(-0.0908) is approximately 0.828.

So [H+]=8.28e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028015 ) /8.28e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028015 =5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.28e-8 →5.0427e-14 /8.28e-8 = (5.0427/8.28) * 1e-6.

5.0427 /8.28 ≈0.6086.

So 0.6086e-6 →6.086e-7 M.

So approximately 6.09e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (6.24e-7), but option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Am I considering all the phosphate equilibria correctly? Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species. So [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = total phosphate.

But in this case, we have added H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. So the total phosphate is 0.0367 +0.028015 =0.064715 M.

But considering the dissociation, the sum includes H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the question says 'orthophosphate ions' which I think refers to PO4^3-.

Hmm, but another thought: perhaps the given salts actually form a buffer that affects the [H+] and the [PO4^3-].

Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, but it's a very small concentration.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to compute this. Let's think about the speciation.

In solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the presence of H+ and OH- allows for some of them to dissociate further.

But for PO4^3-, using the third Ka.

So [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].

Which is what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, but in solution, the HPO4^2- would dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So the actual [HPO4^2-] is slightly less than 0.028015 M, but the change is negligible because Ka3 is so small.

So the approximation is valid.

So, why is the calculated value about 6.09e-7, but the option A is 6.24e-7.

Perhaps more precise calculation is needed.

Let me compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.0908 → [H+] = 10^-7.0908.

Compute 10^(-7.0908) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0908).

Compute 10^(-0.0908):

Take natural logs. Let x = -0.0908.

ln(10^x) =x * ln(10) → ln(10^-0.0908)= -0.0908 *2.302585 ≈-0.2093.

So e^(-0.2093) ≈ 0.811.

So 10^(-0.0908)=0.811.

So [H+] =1e-7 *0.811 =8.11e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028015) /8.11e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028015=5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.11e-8→5.0427e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0427 /8.11) *1e-6.

5.0427 /8.11 →5.0427 ÷8.11 =0.6217 approximately.

So 0.6217e-6 →6.217e-7 M.

Ah, that's about 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A:6.24e-7.

So the correct answer is A.

But wait, why did the initial approximation give me 6.09e-7 and this more precise calculation gives 6.22e-7?

Because in the more precise calculation, [H+] is 8.11e-8, which is slightly lower than the initial 8.21e-8, which would lead to a higher [PO4^3-].

Yes, because [H+] is in the denominator, so a smaller [H+] would increase [PO4^3-].

So in this more precise calculation, [PO4^3-] is about 6.22e-7, which aligns closely with option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and equilibria:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol).  
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes H₂PO₄⁻ ions.  

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005603 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes HPO₄²⁻ ions.  

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L.  
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{0.00734}{0.2} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}
  \]  
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{0.005603}{0.2} \approx 0.028015 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The pH is given by:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} \right)
\]  
- \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \)  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = \frac{0.028015}{0.0367} \approx 0.764
  \]  
- \( \log(0.764) \approx -0.115 \)  
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.115 \approx 7.092
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate [H⁺] from pH
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Use \( \text{Ka}_3 \) to find [PO₄³⁻]
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄}^{3-}, \quad \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
The expression for \( \text{Ka}_3 \) is:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄}^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028015)}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
- Numerator:  
  \[
  (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028015) \approx 5.0427 \times 10^{-14}
  \]  
- Denominator:  
  \[
  8.11 \times 10^{-8}
  \]  
- Result:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.0427 \times 10^{-14}}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO₄}^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**.
