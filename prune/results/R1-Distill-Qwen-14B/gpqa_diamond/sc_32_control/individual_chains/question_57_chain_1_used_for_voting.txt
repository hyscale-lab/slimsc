Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, phase shifts are important, especially when dealing with partial waves.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ with values 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The rest are ignored. Oh right, the scattering amplitude usually involves a sum over all the partial waves, each contributing a term involving the phase shift. 

I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a certain formula. Oh right, the formula involves a sum over l of (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} multiplied by some Legendre polynomial. But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0 degrees. 

At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) is always 1 for any l. So that simplifies things. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part would then be the sum from l=0 to l_max of (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), right? Because when you split e^{iδ_l} into cos and sin terms, the imaginary part is sin(δ_l). 

So the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0 to 4} (2l+1) * sin(δ_l). Let me make sure I get that right. Each term is (2l+1) multiplied by the sine of the phase shift for that l. 

Let me calculate each term step by step. 

Starting with l=0 (δ₀=90°). sin(90°) is 1. So (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1=1.

Next, l=1 (δ₁=67°). sin(67°). Let me compute that. I'll need a calculator. Wait, 67 degrees in radians is about 1.169 radians. The sine of 67 is approximately 0.9205. So (2*1+1)=3. So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

Then l=2 (δ₂=55°). Sin(55°) is approximately 0.8192. (2*2+1)=5. So 5 * 0.8192 ≈ 4.096.

Next, l=3 (δ₃=30°). Sin(30) is 0.5. (2*3+1)=7. So 7 * 0.5 = 3.5.

Then l=4 (δ₄=13°). Sin(13°) is approximately 0.22495. (2*4+1)=9. So 9 * 0.22495 ≈ 2.02455.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 (from l=0) + 2.7615 (l=1) = 3.7615
Plus 4.096 (l=2): 3.7615 +4.096=7.8575
Plus 3.5 (l=3): 7.8575 +3.5=11.3575
Plus 2.02455 (l=4): 11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part in units of fm. Oh wait, wait. Am I missing a factor here? Because the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is proportional to some constants as well. Oh right, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ). But when considering the imaginary part, it's sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(1) as P_l(1)=1.

But wait, the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is given by that sum. But what about the actual units? Because in practice, the scattering amplitude has units of inverse length (since it appears in the differential cross-section, which involves |f|^2). But the options are given in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 meters.

Wait a second, I think I might be missing a factor related to the Born approximation or something else. Or perhaps the question is using a specific formula that includes another factor. Alternatively, maybe the sum I calculated is scaled by the wavelength or something else.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given in units of fm⁻¹. But the options are in fm, so perhaps I have a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 1/k or something.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0} (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ). So in this case, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, as P_l(1)=1.

But wait, in the Born approximation, for electrons, we might have a relation involving the wavevector k and the impact parameter. But the phase shifts are given, so perhaps it's just the sum we have.

Wait, but the sum I calculated is about 13.382. But looking at the options, all are in the hundreds or thousands. So I must have missed a factor. Wait, where's the mistake?

Ah! Oh right, the phase shifts are in degrees, but in the formula for the scattering amplitude, the phase shifts are in radians. So I should have converted the phase shifts from degrees to radians before taking the sine.

Oh no, that's a big mistake! So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin(δ_l).

Let me redo the calculations with that in mind.

So, for each l:

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1 → term is 1.

l=1: δ=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So same as before.

Wait, wait, but the calculation of sin doesn't change whether the angle is in degrees or radians when using calculator functions? Wait, no. Wait, no, because when I compute sin(67 degrees), the calculator would have to be in degree mode. But when I compute sin(1.16937 radians), that's the same value as sin(67 degrees). So actually, whether I compute it as sin(67°) or sin(1.16937) in radians, the result is same. So the mistake I thought I made doesn't change the value.

Wait, but wait—no, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but in the formula, the argument of sine is in radians. So perhaps they should be converted. But no, because in scientific calculations, the trigonometric functions in the formula (like in the phase shifts) would be in radians. So I think the initial approach was correct—the phase shifts are in degrees, but to compute their sine, I should convert them to radians first.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think. If δ is given in degrees, but the formula uses radians, then when calculating sin(δ), I must convert δ from degrees to radians before taking the sine. So in my previous calculations, I did take the sine correctly because I converted the degrees to radians in my mind. For example, sin(90 degrees) is 1, same as sin(π/2) radians.

Wait, no, in the calculations above, I treated the angles as degrees because I computed sin(67°) directly. So if the formula expects the angle in radians, then I should have converted each angle to radians first and then taken the sine. Wait, but I think the formula doesn't care about the units as long as the sine is computed correctly. So perhaps the way I did it before was right.

Wait, but regardless, in this case, the sum came out to about 13.38, but the options are in the hundreds or thousands. So perhaps I missed a factor elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by (1/k), where k is the wave number. Because scattering amplitude f has units of inverse length, so when you multiply by k (which is 2π/λ, in units of inverse length), f * k would be dimensionless. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, which involves the total cross-section. But perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the expression for the differential cross-section, which is dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|². But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of f(0), so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of k, where k is the wavevector of the electrons. The electrons are 50 MeV, so we can compute their momentum and hence k.

Yes, that must be it. Because the scattering amplitude f has units of inverse length, but when multiplied by k, it becomes dimensionless. So perhaps the imaginary part of f is (sum terms) multiplied by some factor involving k.

Wait, let me think about the Born approximation. The scattering amplitude in the first Born approximation is given by f(θ) ≈ -(m/(2π ħ² k)) ∫ (e^{i k r \cosθ} -1) V(r) dr, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) (something like that), but including a factor of (1/k) or something else.

Wait, from scattering theory, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} P_l(cosθ) - 1) )

But that's when considering the full wavefunction. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude is often written as f = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) / (something). Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, I think I need to recall the correct formula. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1)] P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, that's not right. Another thought: The scattering amplitude in partial waves is expressed as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look it up in my memory. The correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} P_l(cosθ) -1) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: when considering the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion, each term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} P_l(cosθ) - 1) ) / (2ik) )

But if we're looking at this at θ=0, then P_l(1)=1, so the expression simplifies.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr cosθ} -1) P_l(cosθ)

At θ=0, cosθ=1, so e^{2ikr}.

But I'm getting stuck because I can't recall the correct formula. Let's think about units. The scattering amplitude should have units of length^{-1}, because it appears in the cross-section as |f|^2, which is (length^{-2}).

So perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 1/(2k) where k is the wave number, which has units of length^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) (e^{iδ_l} -1)

Wait, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) (something else)

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction, so θ=0. That means I need to compute Im(f(0)).

The formula for f(θ) in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) / (2ik)

Wait, now I'm more confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

Which would make sense because e^{iδ_l} -1 = 2i sin δ_l e^{iδ_l/2}, giving an imaginary component.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr cosθ} -1) P_l(cosθ)

Which, when evaluated at θ=0, becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} -1) * 1

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the units. The sum I calculated earlier was about 13.382, but the options are in the hundreds or thousands. So perhaps this sum is multiplied by a factor involving k, which depends on the energy.

Since the electrons are 50 MeV, their momentum p can be calculated, and then k would be p/ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So first, let's compute the momentum p of the electrons. The energy E is 50 MeV. For relativistic electrons, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But wait, for electrons, the rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much higher, so the electrons are ultra-relativistic. So we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c). 

But let me compute it more accurately. Let me use natural units where c=1. So E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m^2 c^4 ). So p c = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 )

But in natural units, E is in MeV, m is 0.511 MeV/c². So,

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ ~49.997 MeV.

So p ≈ 49.997 MeV/c.

But wait, to get p in units of kg m/s, perhaps I should convert everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm).

Wait, ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. But perhaps it's easier to work in units where ħ c is in MeV·fm.

Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, since E=50 MeV, and because E ≈ pc, then p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) ) = (50 / 197.33) fm^{-1}.

Calculating that: 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Now, going back to the scattering amplitude. If the formula for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} -1) P_l(1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps f(θ) itself is given by (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) at θ=0, because P_l(1)=1.

Wait, another approach: the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) / (2ik)

So, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) / (2ik )

Taking the imaginary part of f(0), we get:

Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) Im[ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ] / (2ik )

Wait, let's compute e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) = e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l}.

The imaginary part of this is sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l).

So, Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ] / (2ik )

But wait, I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) / (2ik )

So, the imaginary part is:

Im(f(θ)) = sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ] P_l(cosθ) / (2k )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ] / (2k )

Let me compute each term now.

Compute each (2l+1) * [ sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l ] / (2k )

So, k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Compute for each l:

l=0: (2*0+1) [ sin(180°) - sin(90) ] 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, for l=0, δ_0=90°, so 2δ_0=180°. So sin(180)=0, sin(90)=1. So [0 - 1] = -1.

Term: 1 * (-1) = -1.

Divide by (2k) → -1/(2 *0.253) ≈ -1/(0.506) ≈ -1.976 fm.

But wait, the imaginary part should be summed, but I'm getting a negative value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) * ( sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ) ] / (2k )

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the denominator is (2k) and the numerator is the sum.

So let's compute the sum for each l.

For l=0:

2δ_0 = 180°, sin(180)=0. sin(90)=1 → 0 -1 = -1.
Term: (1) * (-1) = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°. sin(134)= sin(180-46)= sin(46) ≈ 0.7193. sin(67)=0.9205.

So 0.7193 -0.9205≈ -0.2012.

Multiply by (3): 3*(-0.2012)= -0.6036.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397. sin(55)=0.8192.

So 0.9397 -0.8192=0.1205.

Multiply by 5 → 5*0.1205=0.6025.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60° → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. sin(30)=0.5.

So 0.8660 -0.5=0.3660.

Multiply by 7 →7 *0.3660≈2.562.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26° → sin(26)≈0.4384. sin(13)≈0.22495.

So 0.4384 - 0.22495 ≈0.21345.

Multiply by 9 →9 *0.21345≈1.921.

Now let's sum all these terms:

l=0: -1
l=1: -0.6036 → total so far: -1 -0.6036 =-1.6036
l=2: +0.6025 → total: -1.6036+0.6025≈-1.0011
l=3: +2.562 → total: -1.0011 +2.562≈1.5609
l=4: +1.921 → total: 1.5609 +1.921≈3.4819.

So the sum is approximately 3.4819.

Now, Im(f(0)) = sum / (2k) = 3.4819 / (2 * 0.253) ≈3.4819 / 0.506 ≈6.88 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option D: 251.271 fm. Hmm, that doesn't match. So either my approach is wrong, or I've made a calculation mistake.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) * sin δ_l / (2k )

Earlier, the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l was approximately 13.38, and k is 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) = (13.38) / (2 * 0.253) ≈13.38 / 0.506 ≈26.44 fm.

Hmm, none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 1/k, not divided.

Wait, let me think again. If the formula is f(0) = sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} / (2ik), then the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k).

In that case, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.38, so Im(f(0)) = 13.38 / (2*0.253) ≈13.38 / 0.506 ≈26.44 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is different. Let me think again. Another possibility is that f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) / (2ik )

Which would give:

Im(f(θ)) = sum (2l+1) [sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l)] P_l(cosθ) / (2k )

At θ=0, this becomes:

Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) [sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l)] / (2k )

Which is what I calculated earlier as approximately 3.4819 / (2k) → 3.4819 / 0.506 ≈6.88 fm.

But again, that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm. Maybe I should try another approach. Let me recall that the total cross-section σ_total is given by the optical theorem:

σ_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k.

Wait, let's go back to the options. They are all in the hundreds or thousands of fm. My earlier calculations with the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l being 13.38, divided by 0.506 gives about 26 fm. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the factor I'm missing is the energy in a different unit. Let me re-calculate k.

The correct way to compute k is k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Given that E = 50 MeV, and for electrons, E ≈ pc (since E >> m c²), so p = E / c.

But in terms of ħ, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So p = E / c = 50 MeV / (c) → in units where c=1, p =50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = (50 / 197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which is what I had earlier.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually f(θ) = sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) / (2ik )

So Im(f(θ))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ) / (2k )

At θ=0, this becomes sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

So sum is 13.38, 13.38/(2*0.253) =13.38 / 0.506≈26.44 fm.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ikr} -1) P_l(cosθ)

But if we're considering the imaginary part at θ=0, and perhaps considering r=0, but that's not making much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) / (2ik )

Then, the imaginary part is:

Im(f(θ)) = sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ) / (2k )

At θ=0, sum is 3.4819, divided by (2k)=0.506 → 6.88 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses δ_l in radians, so I should convert the phase shifts to radians before calculating the sine terms.

Let me re-calculate the sum where each δ_l is in radians.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l in radians)

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 rad. sin(π/2)=1. Term: 1*1=1.

l=1: 67° → 1.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)=sin(67)=0.9205. Term:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:55°→ 0.95993 rad. sin(0.95993)=0.8192. Term:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:30°→0.523599 rad. sin(0.523599)=0.5. Term:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:13°→0.226893 rad. sin(0.226893)=0.22495. Term:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

No change, same sum.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by something else, like the wavelength or something.

Wait, the wavelength λ is related to k by λ=2π/k. So λ=2π/(0.253) ≈25.05 fm.

But I'm not sure how that would factor in.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/k) * something else.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and when calculating the cross-section, you have |f|^2. But the question is about the amplitude itself.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Maybe the question expects the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is approximately 13.38, and that's the answer in units of fm. But 13.38 isn't an option. The options are 87163, 355, 177, 251.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e-15 somewhere, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplied by the wavelength or something else.

Wait, the wavelength λ is about 25 fm as I calculated earlier. So 13.38 * λ ≈13.38 *25≈334.5 fm. Which is close to option B) 355.351 fm. Hmm, but it's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum * (something else).

Wait, perhaps the factor is 1e-15, but 13.38 * 1e-15 is 1.338e-14, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula expects the sum multiplied by 2π/(k), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude is given in units of fm⁻¹, but the question is asking for the imaginary part in fm. So perhaps I should multiply the sum by the appropriate factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

Which would be 13.38 / (2 *0.253 )=13.38 /0.506 ≈26.44 fm. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by k, which is 0.253 fm⁻¹.

13.38 * 0.253 ≈3.38 fm. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm. Wait, 177 is approximately half of 355, which is option B. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 *1=1

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) ?

Because ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 13.38 *197.33 MeV fm = 2643.3 MeV fm. But that doesn't seem to make sense in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by 1/(ħ c) → 13.38 /197.33 ≈0.0678 fm⁻¹. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the sum multiplied by k. 13.38 *0.253≈3.38 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wave number k is in units of inverse meters, but I think I'm getting too stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total cross-section using the optical theorem and see if that helps. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

But I don't have the total cross-section value, so that might not help directly.

Alternatively, let's think about the options. Option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately 251. That's close to 2 * 125.5, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, let me consider that the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.38, and 13.38 multiplied by (2π) is about 83.9. No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the k factor and just take the sum, but that gives 13.38, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula. Another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given by (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1 sin δ_l) / (2k )

Wait, sum is 13.38, so 13.38/(2 *0.253 )=13.38/0.506≈26.44 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (2π) )

Because ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So 13.38 * (197.33) / (2 * 3.1416) ) ≈13.38 *197.33 /6.2832 ≈13.38 *31.36 ≈419.7 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the answer is option C, 177.675 fm. How would I get that?

Wait, another idea: perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, and multiply by (ħ c)/(2π) → 197.33 / (2 *3.1416) ) ≈31.36 fm.

So 13.38 *31.36 ≈419.7 fm. No, again not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c) → 13.38 *197.33 ≈2643.3 fm². No, units don't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l 

k is 0.253 fm⁻¹ → 0.253 *13.38≈3.38 fm.

But that gives around 3.38 fm, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (ħ c) instead.

13.38 *197.33 MeV fm = 2643.3 MeV fm. No idea how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each sin δ_l should be multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (2m_e c^2)

Where m_e is the electron mass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c)/(E), where E is 50 MeV.

So, 13.38 * (197.33) /50 ≈13.38 *3.9466 ≈52.71 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (2E) )

Which would be 13.38 *197.33 / (2*50) ) → 13.38 *197.33 ≈2643 → 2643 /100 =26.43 fm.

Again, not matching.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach. Given that the options don't match my calculations, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula or perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is roughly 251.

Wait, 251 is approximately 2 * 125.5, which could be 2 * (50 MeV * something). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 13.38 multiplied by 197.33 (ħ c), giving 2643.3, which is not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c)/(2m_e c^2). Let's compute that.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, (ħ c)/(2m_e c^2)= 197.33/(2*0.511) ≈197.33/1.022≈193.15 MeV^{-1}.

So, Im(f) =13.38 * 193.15 ≈2585.4 fm.

No, that's way too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (ħ c)/(m_e c^2), which would be 197.33 /0.511 ≈386.3.

So, Im(f)=13.38 *386.3 ≈5155 fm. No match.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since time is limited, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm. Because 177 is about twice 88.8, which is close to the sum 13.38 multiplied by 13.8 (but I don't know why that factor).

But without a clear path, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 13.38, and the correct formula includes a factor of 2π. So 13.38 * 2π ≈83.9. Not matching any options.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the sum is multiplied by ħ c/(k), where k is in units of fm⁻¹.

So, 13.38 * (197.33 MeV fm) / (0.253 fm⁻¹) ) → 13.38 * (197.33 /0.253 ) MeV fm^2.

Wait, 197.33 /0.253 ≈780.7.

13.38 *780.7 ≈10465 fm^2 → which would be a cross-section. But none of the options are in that range.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the formula is simply the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is 13.38, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (something), but I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear path, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm. How?

Wait, 251 is close to 2 * 125.5, and 125.5 is approximately (2l+1) sum multiplied by something. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by (ħ c)/(E), where E=50 MeV.

So 13.38 * (197.33/(50)) ) →13.38 *3.9466≈52.71 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/k), where k is in units of fm⁻¹.

13.38 * (1/0.253) ≈52.88 fm.

No, that's not an option either.

At this point, I think I have to concede that I'm not able to find the correct approach, but I'll make an educated guess based on the options. The sum I calculated is about 13.38, and the options are much larger. If I multiply by 20, I get 267, which is close to option D)251.271. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is sum (2l+1) * sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c) in MeV fm. So 13.38 *197.33 ≈2643 MeV fm. But that's not an option.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 13.38 multiplied by (197.33/197.33 *13.38) ?? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (2π) * (ħ c)/ (something). Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum and multiply by (ħ c)/(k).

Wait, k =0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, (ħ c)/k =197.33 MeV fm / 0.253 fm⁻¹ ≈780.7 MeV fm².

Then, sum * (ħ c)/k →13.38 *780.7 ≈10465 MeV fm². But that doesn't match any options.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a choice. I'll go with option C) 177.675 fm. Because 177 is approximately 13.38 multiplied by 13.23, but I don't know why that factor would be used.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the units for the scattering amplitude are in inverse wavelength, so the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * wavelength. The wavelength is about 25 fm as computed earlier. 13.38 *25≈334.5 fm. Which is close to option B) 355.351. Hmm, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (wavelength/2π) →13.38 * (25/6.283) →13.38 *3.979≈53.08 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the formula includes a factor of (2l+1) for each term, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is 251.271. Let me think if 251 is 2 * sum multiplied by something.

Wait, 251 /13.38 ≈18.77.

Hmm, not sure.

In the end, I think the correct formula is f(0) = sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} / (2ik ), so Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k ) →13.38 / (2 *0.253 )=26.44 fm. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

The momentum p is given by p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) /c → in natural units where c=1, p= sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 )=sqrt(2500-0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)=49.997 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) )= (49.997/197.33) fm⁻¹ → approx 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k ) →13.38/(2*0.2533)=13.38/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

But no option matches that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (2 E ), where E=50 MeV.

So, 13.38 *197.33 / (2*50) →13.38 *197.33=2643.3 →2643.3/(100)=26.43 fm.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c) / (E ), so 2643.3/(50) →52.86 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c)/(m_e c^2 ), which is 13.38 *197.33 /0.511 →13.38 *386.3 →5155 fm.

No match.

I think I'm out of options. I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option D)251.271 fm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c)/(2π k ), where k is in fm⁻¹.

So, k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

(ħ c)/(2π k )=197.33 / (2π *0.253) →197.33/(1.594)≈123.7 fm.

So Im(f(0))=13.38 *123.7≈1657 fm. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with option D)251.271 fm based on the sum multiplied by (ħ c)/(something) but I can't figure it out.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, the problem involves using the given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$ in the partial wave expansion. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at $\theta = 0$ is expressed as:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number of the electrons, calculated using their momentum $p$ and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$. For ultra-relativistic electrons with energy $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$, $p \approx E/c$, and $k = p / \hbar$. Using $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}$, $k$ is computed as:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The sum $\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)$ is calculated as follows:

- For $l=0$: $(2(0)+1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$.
- For $l=1$: $(2(1)+1) \sin(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615$.
- For $l=2$: $(2(2)+1) \sin(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096$.
- For $l=3$: $(2(3)+1) \sin(30^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5$.
- For $l=4$: $(2(4)+1) \sin(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455$.

Adding these terms gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 = 13.382.
\]

Substituting into the formula for $\text{Im}(f(0))$:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{13.382}{0.506} \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this result. After extensive consideration of alternative approaches, including potential missing factors or misinterpretations of the formula, the closest match to the options appears to be **D) 251.271 fm**, though the reasoning behind this discrepancy remains unclear. Given the options and the calculations, **D) 251.271 fm** is selected as the most plausible answer.

Answer: D
