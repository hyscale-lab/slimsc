Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, right? So I remember that a density matrix is a positive semi-definite matrix with trace equal to 1.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, let me write that out in matrix form. The |0⟩⟨0| term is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So when I add them together, I get a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal becomes 1/2. So the density matrix is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I think that's correct. Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, wait—the density matrix isn't necessarily a pure state. So if it's a mixed state, how is it represented?

Ah right, any single qubit state can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector. For a density matrix ρ, it can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So here, the density matrix ρ should fit into this form.

Let's break it down. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is 2x2, and r·σ is the vector [σ_x, σ_y, σ_z] dotted with r. So let's compute this.

First, I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I + r·σ)/2 becomes (1/2)*[ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ].

But the given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2 and off-diagonal zeros. Comparing the two matrices:

(1/2)*[ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ] should equal [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ].

So setting the elements equal:

Top-left: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Top-right: (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y =0.

Similarly, bottom-left: same as top-right, consistent.

Bottom-right: (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same as top-left, so r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0,0,0). That would mean the density matrix is at the completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me check the options again.

Option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the right answer. 

So the density matrix is in the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the completely mixed state. So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere coordinates.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit state can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given density matrix, we equate the elements:

1. From the top-left element: \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which gives \( r_z = 0 \).
2. From the top-right element: \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \), which gives \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).
3. From the bottom-right element: \( \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which is consistent with \( r_z = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to the state \( |0\rangle \langle 0| \), which is a pure state.
- **C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.
- **D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
