Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with some numbers.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (often denoted as cτ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime) depends on the particle's lifetime. Oh right, particles with a shorter lifetime decay more quickly, so the mean distance they travel before decaying is shorter.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right, the relation involves the decay width Γ. I think the formula is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, units might be tricky here.

Wait, no, actually, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that makes sense. So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width. A larger Γ means a shorter lifetime, so particles decay faster and have a shorter mean path.

But then, the mean decay distance is cτ, so c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the production energy E_X is higher than the mass m_X. Oh, wait, because when a particle is produced, if E is greater than m, it's moving, so its lifetime would be longer due to time dilation.

Right, because from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer than its proper lifetime τ. So the mean decay distance is (γ c τ), where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c^2), but wait, E here is the total energy. So E_X is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = let's see, that's 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but since E is the total energy, and mass is m c², so yes, E = γ m c². So γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula for the mean decay length. Let me think again.

The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. So the mean decay distance is c * γ τ = c * γ * (ħ / Γ).

So putting it together: decay distance = (c * ħ * γ) / Γ.

But wait, let me make sure about the units. All the constants and units might be a bit tricky. So let's write down the constants.

Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. The speed of light c is about 3 × 10^8 m/s.

But wait, let me see: ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So when we compute ħ divided by Γ, which is in GeV, the units would be seconds. Then multiply by c in m/s, and by γ (which is dimensionless), to get meters.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate τ (proper lifetime): τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So:

τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24? Wait, 1e-25 * 20 is 2e-24, so yes.

Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So 2.056875e-24 s multiplied by 6.666666... gives approximately 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Then, the decay distance is c multiplied by this time. c is 3e8 m/s.

So decay distance d = c * (γ τ) = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 3e8 and 1.37125e-23: 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375, and exponents 8 + (-23) = -15. So 4.11375e-15 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, so my result is about 4.11e-15, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15). But maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers. Let me do the calculations again.

First, calculate τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 ÷ 0.32: Let me calculate that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. So 0.182 / 0.32 = ~0.56875. So 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, gamma is E/(m c²). E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV.

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is 20/3, which is 6.666666666666666...

So gamma * tau = 2.056875e-24 s * (20/3) = (2.056875 * 20) / 3 * 1e-24.

Calculating 2.056875 * 20: 2.056875 * 20 = 41.1375.

41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125.

So, gamma tau is 13.7125e-24 s? Wait, no, because 2.056875e-24 * (20/3) = 2.056875 * (20/3) * 1e-24 s.

Wait, 2.056875 * (20/3) = 2.056875 * 6.666666... Let me compute that.

2.056875 * 6 = 12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.666666... is approximately 2.056875 * 2/3 = 1.37125.

Adding up: 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, because 2.056875e-24 * (20/3) = (2.056875 * 20) /3) * 1e-24 = (41.1375 /3) * 1e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s.

So, decay length is c * (gamma tau) = 3e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 * 13.7125e-24 = (3 * 13.7125) )e (8 + (-24)) )= 41.1375e-16 meters.

Wait, 41.1375e-16 m is 4.11375e-15 m, which is about 4.11e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15.

Hmm, I got approximately 4.11e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15. Close, but not exactly. Maybe I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in gamma calculation. Gamma is E over m c², but E is the total energy. Oh, wait, E = gamma m c^2, so gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the exact value of ħ is more precise. I used 6.582e-25 GeV s, but perhaps it's more like 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me check a more precise value of ħ in GeV·s.

I think the value is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So that part is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the calculation is done differently, using the natural units and conversion factors.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the decay length using the formula:

d = (c * ħ * γ ) / Γ

Because tau is ħ/(Γ), so d = c * gamma * tau = c * gamma * ħ / Γ.

So, putting it all together:

d = (c * ħ * gamma ) / Γ.

So let's compute each part.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so ħ / Gamma is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply by gamma (6.666666...): 2.056875e-24 * 6.666666... = 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, gamma * (ħ / Gamma) is (gamma * ħ ) / Gamma.

So,

gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... 

So, (gamma * ħ) = 6.666666... * 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

6.666666... * 6.582 = ?

6 * 6.582 = 39.492.

0.666666 * 6.582 ≈ 4.388.

So total is approximately 43.88.

So, 43.88e-25 GeV·s.

Divide by Gamma (0.32 GeV):

(43.88e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (43.88 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

43.88 / 0.32 = approx 137.125.

So 137.125e-25 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, that's the same as before. Then, multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

d = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (3 * 1.37125) e (8 -23) ) m.

3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375.

8 -23 = -15.

So, 4.11375e-15 meters.

Hmm, that's 4.11375e-15 m. So looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So my answer is about 4.11e-15, which is closest to option B, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I used an approximate value of ħ. Let me check the precise value of ħ in GeV·s.

The exact value is approximately ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I think I used the right value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation uses the decay width Γ in MeV instead of GeV, but I think I converted it correctly. Γ is 320 MeV, so 0.32 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate gamma again.

Gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

Yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should compute using the speed v instead of gamma. Because another approach is to find the velocity beta (v/c) and then compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). But I don't think that's necessary because I already have gamma from E = gamma m c^2.

Wait, perhaps the mean lifetime is calculated without considering gamma. No, no, because the mean decay distance is definitely from the lab frame, so time dilation must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the mean decay length is c multiplied by (ħ c) / (Gamma m c^2) ). No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (c * ħ * gamma) / (Gamma * m c^2). Wait, no, because Gamma has units of GeV, and m c^2 is GeV. So let me see:

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in the same units.

Let me try to compute the decay length again, more accurately.

Compute gamma:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666666666...

So gamma ≈ 6.66666666666666666667.

Compute tau = ħ / Gamma.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s

Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma tau = 6.66666666666666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

6.66666666666666666667 is 20/3.

20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 )e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125.

So gamma tau = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Decay distance = c * gamma tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So d = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) ) * 1e(8 -23) ) = 4.11375 * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.114e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close but not exactly the same. Hmm, so perhaps I made an approximation error in the calculation of gamma or ħ.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise values for ħ. Let me check the exact value of ħ in GeV·s.

Looking it up, I see that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Let me compute gamma * ħ more accurately.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 = 6.666666666666667.

So gamma * ħ = (20/3) * 6.582e-25 GeV·s = (20 * 6.582) /3 )e-25.

20 *6.582 = 131.64.

131.64 /3 = 43.88.

So gamma * ħ = 43.88e-25 GeV·s.

Now, decay length d = (gamma * ħ * c) / (Gamma * c^2).

Wait, no, because Gamma is in GeV, and the formula is d = (c * gamma * tau) = (c * gamma * ħ) / Gamma.

So d = (c * gamma * ħ) / Gamma.

But c is in m/s, gamma is unitless, ħ in GeV·s, Gamma in GeV.

So,

d = (3e8 m/s) * (43.88e-25 GeV·s) ) / (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let's compute that.

The GeV units cancel, the s in denominator from Gamma?

Wait, no, let me write it step by step.

d = (3e8 m/s) * (43.88e-25 GeV·s) ) / (0.32 GeV).

So the GeV in numerator and denominator cancel. The s in numerator and denominator cancel as well.

So:

d = (3e8 m) * (43.88e-25) ) / 0.32.

Compute 3e8 * 43.88e-25 = ?

3 *43.88 = 131.64.

131.64e8-25 = 131.64e-17.

Then, divide by 0.32: 131.64e-17 / 0.32 = (131.64 / 0.32) e-17.

131.64 / 0.32 = approximately 411.375.

So 411.375e-17 = 4.11375e-15 meters.

Again, same result. So why is option B 4.0655e-15? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma * ħ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate everything in natural units and then convert to meters.

Wait, natural units where ħ = c = 1. Then, the mean decay length would be c * tau * gamma.

Wait, in natural units, time is measured in inverse energy, so perhaps I should compute tau in natural units, then convert to seconds, then multiply by c (in m/s) and gamma.

Let me try that.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

In natural units, ħ = 1 GeV·s (but wait, no, natural units usually have ħ = 1, but dealing with units can get tricky).

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula d = c * (m_X * ħ) / (Gamma * E_X).

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of particle physics formulas.

Another formula I remember is that the mean path is L = (c * tau) * gamma. But I'm not sure if that's the correct way.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the decay length:

L = c * (gamma * tau) = (gamma * c * tau) = (gamma * c * ħ) / Gamma.

So, L = (gamma * c * ħ ) / Gamma.

Plugging in the numbers:

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.66666666666666666667.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (6.66666666666666666667 * 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

The GeV units cancel.

The seconds in numerator and denominator cancel as well.

So,

L = (6.66666666666666666667 * 3e8 * 6.582e-25) / 0.32 m.

Compute numerator: 6.666666666666667 *3e8 = 20e8.

20e8 *6.582e-25 = 20 *6.582e-17 = 131.64e-17 = 1.3164e-15.

Divide by 0.32: 1.3164e-15 /0.32 = (1.3164 /0.32 )e-15.

1.3164 / 0.32 = approximately 4.11375.

So L = 4.11375e-15 m.

Again, same result. So why is the option B 4.0655e-15? Could it be because of a more precise value of ħ?

Wait, perhaps the exact value of ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, but maybe I should use 6.5823e-25? Let me recalculate with more precise ħ.

Compute gamma * ħ = (20/3) * 6.5823e-25 = (20 *6.5823) /3 )e-25.

20 *6.5823 = 131.646.

131.646 /3 = 43.882.

So, gamma * ħ =43.882e-25 GeV·s.

Then,

L = (43.882e-25 GeV·s *3e8 m/s ) / 0.32 GeV.

GeV cancels, s cancels.

So,

L = (43.882e-25 *3e8 ) /0.32 m.

43.882e-25 *3e8 = (43.882 *3 )e( -25 +8 ) = 131.646e-17 = 1.31646e-15.

Divide by 0.32: 1.31646e-15 / 0.32 = 4.1139375e-15 m.

Still around 4.114e-15. So perhaps the correct option is B, but wait, what's option B? 4.0655e-15.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think differently. Maybe I should calculate the velocity beta first and then compute gamma, and then the lifetime.

Wait, beta is v/c. v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) * c.

Wait, gamma is 6.666666666666667.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma²)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444)) )= sqrt( (44.4444 -1)/44.4444 )= sqrt(43.4444 /44.4444 ) ≈ sqrt(0.97777) ≈ 0.9888.

So, beta is about 0.9888, so v ≈ 0.9888 c.

But does this affect the decay length? No, because the decay length is calculated using the lifetime in the lab frame, which already accounts for time dilation via gamma. So I think the earlier approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for decay length is (c * ħ * gamma ) / (Gamma * m_X c^2 ) * (m_X c^2 )?

Wait, no, that seems confused.

Wait, another approach: the total decay width Γ is related to the proper lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ.

But the lab frame sees the particle moving, so the lifetime is longer: τ_lab = gamma τ.

So the decay width in the lab frame is the same as in the rest frame, because decay width is an intrinsic property. So Γ is the same.

Thus, the decay length is c * tau_lab * beta, where beta is v/c.

Wait, wait a minute! Oh, I think I see the mistake. Because the particle is moving, the mean decay length isn't just c * tau_lab, but also multiplied by the velocity beta, because the particle is moving during its lifetime.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because the lifetime is longer, but the particle is moving, so the decay length is c * beta * tau_lab.

Ah! So I missed the beta factor. That would change the calculation.

So the correct formula is:

decay length L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

But tau is in the rest frame, so after time dilation, it's gamma tau.

But wait, beta is v/c, so v = beta c.

Thus, the distance the particle travels before decaying is v * tau_lab.

tau_lab is gamma tau.

So,

L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma.

So,

L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma) = (beta gamma) (c ħ ) / Gamma.

Ah, so I should have included beta in the calculation. Because earlier, I used gamma * c * tau, but tau is the proper lifetime. So tau_lab is gamma tau, and L = v tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.

So, now I need to compute beta.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X^2 c^4)/(E_X^2)).

Wait, E_X is the total energy.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X^2 c^4)/(E_X^2)).

But since E_X and m_X are both in GeV, and c^2 is involved, let me see.

Wait, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4. So,

beta = p c / E.

But perhaps it's easier to compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Wait, m is 1.2 GeV/c², E is 8 GeV.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4) / (E^2)).

But in units where c=1, beta = sqrt(1 - (m²) / (E^2)).

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2) / (8^2)).

1.2 squared is 1.44.

8 squared is 64.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So, now, let's recompute the decay length with beta included.

So,

L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ ) / Gamma.

Compute beta gamma: 0.9887 * (20/3) = 0.9887 *6.666666666666667 ≈ 6.591333333333334.

So,

L = (6.591333333333334) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the numerator:

beta gamma * c * ħ = 6.591333333333334 * 3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s.

Compute 6.591333333333334 *3e8 = 19.774e8.

19.774e8 *6.582e-25 = 19.774 *6.582e(8-25) = 19.774 *6.582e-17.

19.774 *6.582 ≈ let's calculate:

19.774 *6 = 118.644.

19.774 *0.582 ≈ approx 11.524.

Total ≈ 130.168.

So, 130.168e-17 = 1.30168e-15.

Now, divide by Gamma (0.32 GeV):

L = 1.30168e-15 / 0.32 = approximately 4.06775e-15 meters.

Oh! That's about 4.06775e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).

So the correct answer must be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma \frac{c \hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma \frac{c \hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

\[
L = 6.5913 \times \frac{(3 \times 10^8) \times (6.582 \times 10^{-25})}{0.32}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9774 \times 10^9
\]

\[
1.9774 \times 10^9 \times 6.582 \times 10^{-25} = 1.9774 \times 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \approx 1.3017 \times 10^{-15}
\]

Now, divide by \( \Gamma = 0.32 \):

\[
L = \frac{1.3017 \times 10^{-15}}{0.32} \approx 4.0679 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.0679 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
