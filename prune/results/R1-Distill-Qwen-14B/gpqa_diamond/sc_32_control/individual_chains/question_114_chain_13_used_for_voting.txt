Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Oh right, multiple-choice with options A to D. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, okay, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via the cyanide ion. So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think under certain conditions, like acidic or basic, this could vary.

First reaction: Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism would involve the ketone's carbonyl being attacked by the CN- nucleophile. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but that would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that. The nitrile is on the second carbon. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN? Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN or NaCN in a nucleophilic addition, it would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or H3O+.

So in the first step, butan-2-one + NaCN in presence of an acid (H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- would attack, leading to the formation of (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that. Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would imply the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, that doesn't make sense with butanenitrile.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN (or NaCN with an acid) would form a cyanohydrin: (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's five carbons, no? Wait, no, butan-2-one is four carbons, so the product would have four carbons as well. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be: the main chain is four carbons, with a hydroxyl and a methyl group on the second carbon, and a nitrile group also on the second? No, that can't be. Oh wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN as the product. That would be correct. So butan-2-one (four carbons) has the carbonyl on C2. Adding CN- would add to C2, and the hydroxyl would be on C2 as well.

So the first reagent A is the acid. Because cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. So in the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Looking at the options for A: Option A and B have A as H3O+, and C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So that's probably an oxidation of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how do you oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical reagents for this are strong oxidizing agents under acidic conditions. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or perhaps using a mixture of HCl and another oxidizing agent. Alternatively, another method is using H2O with some catalyst or condition.

Wait, but in the reaction given, reagent B is H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. If it's hydrolyzed under strong acidic conditions, you get a carboxylic acid. So for the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid.

So what's reagent B? It's H2O, but under what conditions? If it's in presence of HCl (acid), then it would be acidic hydrolysis. Alternatively, if using CH3COOH, that's a weak acid, so maybe that's a milder condition.

So reagent B options: in the choices, B could be HCl (as in options A and C), or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, the second reaction is 2-hydroxy-... butanenitrile turning into 2-hydroxy-... butanoic acid. So the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is probably an acid catalyst for hydrolysis.

Usually, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is done under strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and H2O, or using HCl as a catalyst. Or maybe using KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis condition where H2O is the solvent. So the catalyst would be HCl.

Wait, but in the options, for B, the options with HCl are A and C. So if B is HCl, then the answer could be A or C.

Wait, but the first reaction's reagent is A: for the cyanohydrin formation, we need an acid. So A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in some reactions, NaHSO3 is used as a catalyst, maybe in the presence of HCN, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes HCN is added with H2SO4 as a catalyst.

Wait, but the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A. So NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile. A is the catalyst. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. So the typical condition is acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4.

In the options, some have A as H3O+ (options A and B), others as NaHSO3 (C and D). So which is correct?

Hm, I think when forming cyanohydrins, the catalyst is typically H3O+ or another acid. So A would be H3O+, making the options A or B. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So first reaction's A is H3O+ in options A and B, and NaHSO3 in C and D.

So which one is correct?

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-, which is a weaker base than HSO4-. But in some cases, NaHSO3 is used as a catalyst in reactions, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but I'm not sure about its role in the formation of cyanohydrins.

But in the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. So the presence of an acid is crucial. So H3O+ is a likely candidate. So A would be H3O+.

So looking at options, A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: the nitrile group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is H2O, but under what conditions?

Wait, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, that's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the conditions would require an acidic environment, perhaps. So if B is HCl, then it's a strong acid, which would facilitate the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid. Maybe for a different type of reaction, like esterification, but for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, strong acid is needed.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl. So the correct options are those where B is HCl. So options A and C.

Since in our first analysis, A is H3O+, which is in option A, so option A would have A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that in the first reaction, NaCN is used with H3O+ as the acid. So that's correct.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is option A or B.

The second reaction uses HCl as B, making the correct option A or C.

So the only option that has A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

Wait, but what about the second reaction's reagent B? HCl is a strong acid, so it would facilitate the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. So B should be HCl, which is in option A.

So putting it together, the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the second reaction again. The nitrile is in a molecule that also has a hydroxyl group. Maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the conditions.

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-... nitrile. When hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids, sometimes the presence of other functional groups can influence the reaction. But in this case, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile group, so perhaps it's a hindered environment.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an oxidation. Wait, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, but that usually requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like O3 followed by work-up.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So it's more likely a hydrolysis reaction than an oxidation. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, which would require HCl as the acid.

So with that, the second reaction's B is HCl.

So the correct option would be option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (option A) is a suitable acid catalyst, while NaHSO₃ (option C) is less common for this type of reaction.

### Reaction 2:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. For this transformation, acidic conditions are typically required. Among the options, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the most appropriate reagent for this reaction, as it facilitates the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Weak acids like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) are generally not strong enough for this purpose.

### Final Analysis:
- For Reaction 1, the correct reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.
- For Reaction 2, the correct reagent B is **HCl**.

The only option that satisfies both conditions is **Option A**.

Answer: A
