Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. Oh right, the formula for distance is something like distance = 1 / parallax, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship, especially with units.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So, we're looking for the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax. The options are all different power laws, so I'm thinking it's about how density changes with distance.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same throughout space. Number density is stars per volume. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Let me think: plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, right?), since 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond.

So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how that volume relates to parallax. If I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr. But since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dr would be in terms of d, which is 1/plx. Let me express dr in terms of plx.

Wait, dr is a small change in distance. Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, because differentiating d = 1/plx, you get dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. But since plx is changing, maybe I should think about how the volume element transforms.

So, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dr. But dr in terms of plx is (1/plx²) d plx, because dr = (dd) = - (1/plx²) d plx, but the sign doesn't matter for volume.

So substituting, volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π (1/plx)^4 d plx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. If d = 1/plx, then d² = (1/plx)^2, and dr = (1/plx²) d plx. So dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx. Which is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (assuming uniform density), the number of stars in a small range of plx (d plx) is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So that would be stars per d plx, which is proportional to 1/(plx^4) * d plx. But wait, no, the number is proportional to dV, which is (1/plx^4) d plx multiplied by a constant. So the number per unit plx would be (1/plx^4) * (d plx) / (d plx) ) = 1/plx^4. Wait, no, because d plx is the range. So the number per unit plx is (number) / (d plx) = (proportional to 1/plx^4 * d plx) ) / (d plx) ) = 1/plx^4.

But wait, that would mean the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars in a given plx range would decrease with plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. If the number density (stars per volume) is constant, then the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the density.

But dV in terms of plx is (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number is n * (4π/(plx^4)) d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n *4π/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases, following 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option D is ~1/plx^3.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the exponent? Because I thought dV is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number of stars. So if the number density is uniform, then the number of stars in a shell (which has volume 4πd² dr) is n * 4πd² dr. Since d=1/plx, this becomes n *4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But dr is (1/plx²) d plx. So substitute:

n *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (n *4π) / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with flux or other things, the relation is 1/plx^3. Wait, no, let me think. Oh, wait, maybe I'm not considering that the parallax range is in the same unit as the distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the solid angle and how the number of stars is distributed in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, let's approach it from another angle. The number of stars in a given range of parallax (d plx) would correspond to a shell at distance d=1/plx with thickness dr = (d plx / plx^2). Because d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/plx² d plx, so dr = (1/plx²) d plx.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in this shell is proportional to 1/plx^4 times d plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is (1/plx^4) * d plx / d plx ) → 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but some sources I've read before suggest that the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) decreases with distance squared. Because the volume element involves d^2 dr. So if distance d increases, the number of stars in a shell increases with d^2, but since number density is same, number per distance would be n *4π d^2 dr / dr = 4π n d^2. So per unit distance, it's proportional to d^2. But as d increases, the number per unit distance increases as d^2. But when d is large, you have more stars in each shell, but the shells are wider in distance terms. Wait, but that's for number per unit distance.

In our case, plx is 1/d. So when plx decreases (d increases), the number per unit plx would depend on how the volume element scales with plx. From earlier, the volume element in plx is 1/plx^4. So per unit plx, it's 1/plx^4.

Hmm, but I'm trying to see if I can relate it to anything I know. For example, the number of stars at distance d is proportional to d^2 (since the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and density is uniform). So number of stars N in a thin shell is n * 4π d² dr. Now, the number per unit distance is N/dr = n 4π d². So as d increases, the number per unit distance increases with d². That's what I thought earlier.

But in the problem, we're considering the number per unit plx. So since d = 1/plx, substituting, the number per unit plx would be N/(d plx) = [n 4π (1/plx)^2 dr ] / (d plx). Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, to get the number per unit plx, we can think of it as the number of stars in a small interval of plx (say, plx to plx + d plx) divided by d plx.

The number in that interval is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr, where dr is the change in distance corresponding to d plx.

dr = (d plx) * (dd/d plx) ) = (d plx) * ( -1/(plx^2) ) ) → but absolute value, so dr = (d plx) / (plx^2).

So N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2) ) = n *4π (d plx)/(plx^4).

Therefore, N per d plx is (n *4π) / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number per unit distance goes up with d squared. Let me think: for a given d, the number per unit d is proportional to d^2. So when plx decreases (d increases), the number per unit d increases. But plx is 1/d, so that would mean the number per unit d is proportional to (1/plx)^2. But in our setup, the problem is about plx, not d.

Hmm, so to wrap up, I think the correct answer is A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), corresponding to option A.
