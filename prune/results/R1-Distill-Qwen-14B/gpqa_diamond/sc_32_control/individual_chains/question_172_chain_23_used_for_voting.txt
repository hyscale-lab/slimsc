Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the relative populations of energy states in a system.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

I think the Boltzmann factor is involved here. The formula is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but in this case, star_1 has twice as many atoms in a certain excited level as star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper/n1_lower = 2. But wait, wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because actually, the specific excitation is about a certain level relative to the ground state or another lower level. But the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars, so ΔE is the same for both.

So applying the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

For star_2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But wait, the problem says that for star_1, the excited level is twice as much as star_2's. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is double that of star_2. Wait, not exactly. Let me think. Let me clarify.

The ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that for star_2. Or is it that the absolute number is twice as much? Hmm, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think the ratio of excited to non-excited (or perhaps the population of a specific level) is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, no, perhaps the populations are in a ratio. Let me model it. Let’s say for star_2, the ratio is R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

For star_1, the same ratio is R1 = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2R, because it's twice as excited. So R1 = 2R.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio for star_1 is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2, while for star_2 it's 1, but that seems unlikely because star_2 would have a lower ratio, which would imply higher temperature? Because higher temperature would lead to higher excitation. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So higher temperature T leads to a larger exponent (since T is in denominator), so the exponent becomes less negative, meaning the ratio is larger. So higher T leads to more excitation, as expected.

So if star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, that implies that the ratio R1 = 2 * R2, where R = n_upper/n_lower.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me assign variables. Let R1 = (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = 2 R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So putting R1 = 2 R2, we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's take the natural log of both sides.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging, let's move the terms involving ΔE to one side:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's see:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Adding ΔE/(k T1) to both sides and adding ΔE/(k T2) to both sides:

0 = ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)

Which can be rearranged as:

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, perhaps I should factor differently.

Let me write the equation again:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Then,

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2)

Hmm, but then I can rearrange:

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (- ln(2)) * (k / ΔE )

But I'm not sure if this is the best way to proceed. Let's think about the answer options.

Looking at the options, they all involve ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)^2 ]

D) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Hmm, not sure. But I think the correct approach is to manipulate the equation to express ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Let me go back to our earlier equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Taking natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

(1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

Wait, but I don't think the options have any constants, so perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the factors with k and ΔE are grouped into something else. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to rearrange the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without involving ΔE.

Wait, but the given energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, but 1.38e-23 J is k_B * 1 eV (approximately 1.6e-19 J), wait no, that's k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yes! Because Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait a second, the ΔE given is 1.38e-23 J. Which is exactly k_B (1 K), since k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So, if ΔE = k_B * 1 K.

So ΔE = k_B * 1 K → because 1.38e-23 J = k_B * 1 K.

So, in our equation, we have:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But substituting ΔE = k * 1:

k * (1) / k (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Simplify:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = - ln(2)

But looking at the equation, I can rearrange:

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = - ln(2)

Alternatively, let's write it as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, but the options don't directly match this. Let me see the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Wait, let's compute the left-hand side of our equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) 

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which implies:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

So from earlier:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Wait, but in our case, the equation is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) → no, because (1/T2 -1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), but let me compute:

No, wait:

1/T2 is (T1) / (T1 T2)

1/T1 is (T2) / (T1 T2)

So 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes. So our equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait, no, from earlier, we had:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2 ) * T1 T2

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Divide both sides by T1 T2:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2 )

Which is option D's equation, but with the left side as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) equals ln(2). Wait, no. Let me look at option D again.

Option D says: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ]

Wait, yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but our equation is (1/T2 -1/T1 ) equals ln(2), which is the same as ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but wait: (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, no, because:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Which would imply that:

(1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But according to our earlier calculation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals ln(2), so the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is exactly option D.

Wait, but let me check once more. Let me retrace the steps.

We started with R1 = 2 R2,

where R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)),

R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) -1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Take ln:

[ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) -1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

We know ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

(k *1 K )/(k ) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Simplify:

(1 K) * (1/(T2) -1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, 1 K is just 1. So,

(1/(T2) -1/(T1)) ) = ln(2 )

But 1/(T2) -1/(T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which is,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the relative populations of energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The key equation is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_{\text{upper}} / n_{\text{lower}}\) is the ratio of populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1, the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms is twice that of star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) (since \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\):

\[
\frac{k}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2),
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
