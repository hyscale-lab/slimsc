Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about transits and the factors that influence the probability of a planet transiting its star from our point of view.

First, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its host star from our perspective, causing a dip in the star's brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But since the planets are Earth-like and we're already using the radial velocity method, maybe other factors come into play here.

The question says both planets have the same minimum mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. Interesting, so same radius but different masses.

I think the probability of transit depends on the orbital distance. Let me think—transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The probability is roughly proportional to (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, or was it (R_p / R_s), but actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the formula.

Wait, I remember the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (b), where b is the impact parameter, which depends on the alignment. But for a circular orbit, the maximum transit probability occurs when the orbit is edge-on, which gives b=0, but the probability isn't 100% because of the geometry. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/R_s)), but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think in terms of the orbital distance.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would transit is (R_*/a)² * (1/(something)). Or wait, another formula: the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (a/(R_*) )) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula I know.

I think the transit probability P is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_*)^2 * ( (R_* + R_p) / a ) )^{-1}, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Specifically, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Since both planets are in circular orbits, we can use that. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than their stars, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

Given that Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3. Let's denote P2 as P, so P1 = P/3.

Using Kepler's third law: (P1)^2 ∝ a1³ / M1, and (P2)^2 ∝ a2³ / M2.

So, ( (P/3)² ) / (P²) ) = (a1³ / M1 ) / ( a2³ / M2 ) )

Simplify left side: (1/9) = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1 )

We know M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

Substituting: 1/9 = (a1³ * M2) / ( a2³ * 2 M2 ) )

The M2 cancels: 1/9 = (a1³) / (2 a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³: 2 a2³ /9 = a1³

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root is roughly 0.6 something.

Alternatively, 2/9 = (2^1)/(3^2) → but cube root of 2 is ~1.26, cube root of 9 is ~2.08. So (2/9)^(1/3) is (2^1)/(3^2) )^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Now, the probability of transit depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (a). Let's call this ratio R*/a. Because the stars have the same radius (since both host stars have same R), R1 = R2 = R.

So for each planet, the ratio R/a is:

For Planet_1: R/a1 = R / (0.605 a2) ≈ 1.651 * (R/a2 )

Wait, wait, because a1 is smaller than a2, so R/a1 is larger than R/a2. That means for Planet_1, the transit probability is higher because the planet is in a tighter orbit.

Wait, but how does that translate into transit probability? The transit probability is proportional to (R/a)^2, isn't it? So let me think. The probability P is proportional to (R/a)^2.

So P1 is proportional to (R/a1)^2 = (1/(0.605 a2/R))^2? Wait, maybe I should define it more clearly.

Wait another approach: The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (a / R_* )) )

Wait, I'm not confident. Let me think about the formula correctly.

The transit probability is the area of the planet relative to the star, which is (R_p / R_*)^2. But that's just the geometric probability if the orbit were edge-on. However, the probability that the orbit is aligned such that the planet transits is another factor. 

Wait, I think the actual probability of transit is given by (R_* / a)^2 * (something). Alternatively, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is approximately (R_*/a)^2 * (some function of the orbital inclination), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability for a circular orbit is given by:

P = (R_p + R_*)^2 / (a²) ) * (sqrt(1 - (R_* + R_p)^2 / a²) )

But no, maybe that's the area of the circle where transit occurs. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by 1/(something). Alternatively, another resource says that the transit probability is (R_*/a)^2 * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So, P ≈ (R_*/a)^2.

Wait, that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, another formula I found: the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)² * (1/(a/(R_*) )). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should simplify. Let's think about the ratio of transit probabilities between the two planets.

Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

The transit probability is proportional to (R/a)^2.

So P1 ∝ (R/a1)^2, P2 ∝ (R/a2)^2.

We found earlier that a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So a1 = a2 * 0.605.

So R/a1 = R/(0.605 a2) = (1/0.605) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.651 * (R/a2).

So (R/a1)^2 ≈ (1.651)^2 * (R/a2)^2 ≈ 2.725 * (R/a2)^2.

Thus, P1 is about 2.725 times P2.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but that can't be right because Planet_1 is closer in, which would make the transit probability higher because the alignment condition is easier to meet. So if a is smaller, R/a is larger, so (R/a)^2 is larger, so higher probability.

So if Planet_1's a is smaller than Planet_2's, then (R/a) is larger, so transit probability is higher.

So in the options, looking for which planet is preferred. The question states that the researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability.

So if Planet_1 has a higher probability, the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Wait, but looking at the options, options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

Wait, no, that can't be right if our calculation says P1 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the ratio of a1 to a2.

We had:

(P1)^2 = (a1^3) / M1 * (some constant), and (P2)^2 = (a2^3) / M2 * same constant.

Given that P1 = (1/3) P2.

So, (P1^2) / (P2^2) = (a1^3 / M1 ) / (a2^3 / M2 ) )

=> (1/9) = (a1^3 * M2) / (a2^3 * M1 )

We know M1 is twice M2.

So M1 = 2 M2.

Substituting: 1/9 = (a1^3 * M2) / (a2^3 * 2 M2 )

The M2 cancels, so 1/9 = a1^3 / (2 a2^3 )

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3).

2 is 2, 9 is 3². So (2)/(3²) = 2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, R/a1 = R / (0.606 a2 ) ≈ 1.648 R / a2.

So (R/a1)^2 ≈ (1.648)^2 ≈ 2.716.

So P1 / P2 = (R/a1)^2 / (R/a2)^2 ) = ( (1.648)^2 ) = approx 2.716.

So P1 is about 2.716 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher. So Option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The transit probability is also influenced by the size of the planet. The question says both planets have the same mass, but their radii aren't given. Wait, the question says the planets are Earth-like, but their radii could be different? Oh wait, the question doesn't state that the radii are the same. Hmm, but the question says both have the same minimum masses. Wait, but the planet radius is not directly given by mass, as gas giants have different densities.

Wait, the problem states: "Both of these planets have the same masses." So R_p is same for both, since same mass and Earth-like (but Earth-like doesn't necessarily mean same radius, but perhaps the question assumes same radius? Or maybe the question doesn't consider planet radius since it's the same for both.)

Wait, the transit probability formula includes R_p, the planet's radius. If both have same mass, but not necessarily same radius. Hmm, but the problem says the host stars have same radii. So R_* is same.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify that the two planets have the same radius. Oh wait, wait, the question says 'Earth-like', but that doesn't mean same radius, but same mass? But the RV method determines minimum mass, not actual mass. Wait, but the question says both have same minimum masses.

But the transit depth depends on (R_p / R_*)^2. If the planets have same mass but different radii, then their R_p would be different. But the question doesn't give their radii.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the planet radii. So perhaps, for the purpose of this question, we're to assume that the planets have same radius as well. Or perhaps, the problem isn't considering R_p, because it's about the probability, not the depth of the transit.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is independent of R_p, assuming both are Earth-like. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance of the planet passing in front) is given by the formula that includes (R_*/a)^2. So it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

In our calculation, we found that Planet_1's a is smaller than Planet_2's, leading to (R/a) being larger, so higher probability.

So according to that, Planet_1 has higher transit probability, so the researchers prefer to observe it, which aligns with option D.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Which matches our earlier (R/a)^2 being approx 2.7, but perhaps we're considering another factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the transit probability isn't (R/a)^2, but (R/(a))² times the probability of the orbital inclination being correct. Wait, but the question is about the probability of any transit given the parameters. But the probability of the orbit being edge-on is independent of a, I think. So the probability of the planet transiting is proportional to (R/a)^2 * (R_p / R_*)^2? Or is it just (R_p / R_*)^2 * (something else)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, when randomly oriented, would cross our line of sight. That depends on the size of the star as seen from the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by the solid angle, but perhaps more accurately, it's (π R_p²) / (π (a R_* )^2 ), which is (R_p/(a R_* ))^2. But no, that's the area of the planet relative to the 'target' area (the disk as seen from Earth). But the actual probability depends on the relative sizes and the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_*)^2 / a^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - ((R_p + R_*)/a)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source says the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_* )) ), but that doesn't seem right dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_* )) ), which would be (R_p * R_* )/(a^2 ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the formula for the transit probability. From what I remember, the probability that a transiting planet is observed is given by:

P = (R_p + R_*)² / (a²) ) × (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_p + R_*)² / a² )) )) × (1 / (something else)).

No, perhaps it's better to think geometrically. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given by the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit (the 'target' area), but scaled by the solid angle.

Wait, actually, the transit probability P is approximately equal to (R_*/a)^2 * ( (R_p + R_*) / R_* )^2 ) / (something else... I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is given by (R_p / R_*)^2 × (R_* / a)^2. So:

P = (R_p^2 / R_*^2) × (R_*^2 / a^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2.

But wait, that would make P = (R_p / a )^2, which seems odd because a is in the denominator. But if a is smaller, P is bigger, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

But wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radius, and the planets have the same minimum mass. But unless we know their radii, perhaps the transit probability depends on R_p^2 / a^2.

But the problem says they're Earth-like, so perhaps R_p is the same for both. So then, P is inversely proportional to a^2. So if Planet_1 has a smaller a, then P1 > P2.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, a1 is about 0.6 a2, so a1^2 is about 0.36 a2^2. So P1 is (1/a1^2) which is 1/(0.36 a2^2) => ~2.78 times higher than P2.

Again, that suggests Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

Looking back at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters and their impact on the transit probability. The transit probability depends on the geometry of the system, specifically the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). The probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).
2. **Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
3. **Star Radii**: Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)).
4. **Planet Masses**: Both planets have the same minimum mass.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Distance to Period
Using Kepler's Third Law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), we can relate the orbital distances of the two planets:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3
\]
\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605 \), we find:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.605a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{R}{a_1}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{R}{a_2}\right)^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{0.605a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.605}\right)^2 \approx 1.651^2 \approx 2.725
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**, as Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability.

Answer: D
