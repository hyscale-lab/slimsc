Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Oh right, Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So if Compound X has a ketone group, after this reaction, it would become an alkane.

Alright, let's look at the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range and probably indicates O-H stretching (like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or maybe an alkyne. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone, which is around 1700-1750. Wait, but maybe it's a carboxylic acid? No, wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is in the 3400–2500 range here. So maybe it's a ketone, but the 1720 could also be an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring with a ketone. Oh, but wait, the 1720 could also be an acid chloride, but I don't see a peak around 800 for that. Let me think... Maybe it's a ketone. Alternatively, it's an ester, but then maybe the O-H is not present, but wait, the IR shows a strong peak around 1720, so more likely a ketone or ester.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through it. 

The peaks are at:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde? But wait, if it's a ketone, there wouldn't be an aldehyde proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenolic OH, but that would be a broad peak and maybe around that region. But wait, the question is about a reaction that reduces a carbonyl, so maybe Compound X is a ketone.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR peaks. 

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This suggests aromatic protons. A doublet with 2H could be two equivalent protons in an aromatic ring, perhaps para to another substituent. Like in a para-substituted benzene. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear around 8.0 ppm as a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H, which might be the other two aromatic protons. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene, where the two protons adjacent to the substituent are at 8.0 and the ones across are at 7.2. That makes sense for a substituent like a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone. So if the substituent is a ketone, then the adjacent protons (ortho) would be more deshielded and appear downfield, like around 8.0 ppm, and the meta protons would be around 7.2.

Wait, but if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the para-substituted ring would have two sets of doublets. Ok, so that makes sense. So perhaps the ring is a benzene with a ketone group at the para position, leading to this NMR pattern.

Wait, but wait. The 8.0 and 7.2 doublets suggest that the substituent is in the para position relative to the adjacent protons. So maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be the ones at 8.0, and positions 3 and 5 at 7.2. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 1, making the adjacent (ortho) positions 2 and 6, and the meta positions 3 and 5. So if the substituent is a carbonyl group at position 1 (like a benzophenone), then the ortho protons would be more deshielded and appear as downfield doublets (8.0 ppm), and the meta protons would be upfield (7.2 ppm).

Wait, but then the substituent is a ketone, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So that would cause the ortho protons to be deshielded, showing up at higher ppm.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with a ketone group. Alternatively, maybe a meta-substituted, but the NMR suggests two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests symmetry, so para substitution makes more sense.

Now, looking at the rest of the NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Hmm, this could be a CH group adjacent to something else. Maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone. Or perhaps it's part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet, 2H. Maybe part of a chain, perhaps a CH2 group next to a CH or something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. A methyl group attached to something that has two neighboring protons. Like a CH(CH3) group. Because, in a CH(CH3) group, the methyl protons would be split into a doublet if the CH is connected to another CH2 or similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, 3H. This is probably a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps there's a chain like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, maybe a longer chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a ketone, and attached to that ketone is a chain. Let me think. So the benzene has a substituent at position 4 (para), which is a ketone, like C(O)R, where R is some alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR signals, perhaps the structure is something like (4-ethylphenyl)propanone. Wait, but let's think more carefully.

The substituent would be a ketone, say R-CO- attached to the benzene. So, the R group must be connected to the carbonyl. Let's imagine R is a propyl group or something similar.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I need to think about the splitting.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH. So if the structure is something like CH2-C(=O)-Ph, then the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. But wait, let me think. The 2.9 is 1H, which is a CH, and the 1.7 is 2H, perhaps as a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

So maybe the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but let's think about the substituents.

Wait, let's consider the substituent attached to the benzene as a propanone group, i.e., (propan-2-one). So, the substituent would be (CH2)2CO, but perhaps with some branching.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group, and the rest of the structure comes from that.

Let me try to reconstruct the structure based on NMR.

Looking at the 10.5 ppm peak: I thought earlier it might be an aldehyde proton, but if the compound is a ketone, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe this is an acidic proton like a phenolic O-H, but in that case, the IR would show a broad peak around 3000-2500, but the IR data includes 3400-2500, which could include an O-H stretch. Wait, but a phenolic O-H would appear as a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde. Wait, but in the reaction, if it's a ketone, then the aldehyde wouldn't be present. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The IR data has 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad area, which could include an O-H stretch (like from a hydroxyl group) or an alkyne C-H stretch (but that's usually around 3300). So 3400-2500 could be O-H, or perhaps an amine N-H, but given the other IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid would have O-H stretch around 2500-3300, and a carbonyl around 1700.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then in NMR, the O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) attached. Let's see.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is the O-H of the carboxylic acid, which would be a broad singlet, which matches. Then, the aromatic protons would be downfield if adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like COOH. So for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ortho protons would be at around 8.0 ppm, and the meta at around 7.2, which matches the NMR data. So that fits.

So the structure would be a para-substituted benzoic acid. Now, what's the substituent on the benzoic acid?

Looking at the other NMR peaks, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest an alkyl chain attached to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be Ph-COOH. But the other peaks indicate more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2 group or something more complex. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branching. Let me consider the NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Maybe a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So like R-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something?

But wait, in the case of a benzoic acid, the substituent would be attached to the ring, perhaps as a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group, but that would mean a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ethyl group.

Wait, let me consider the substituent as a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 group or something like that. Hmm, perhaps a branching is present.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a multiplet for two protons. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH or something. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another group. So perhaps a structure like CH(CH2CH2CH3)2? Or maybe CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which would fit if it's a methyl group attached to a CH that is connected to another CH2 or similar.

Wait, let me try to sketch this out.

Suppose the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. But wait, that would make the structure a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a (CH2CH2CH3)CH2 group attached to the benzene, but I'm not getting it right.

Wait, another approach: the 0.9 ppm triplet with 3H suggests a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, but perhaps with a branch.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but where would that fit?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. So the benzene has a substituent which is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH2CH3), and then another CH2 group connected to that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH2CH3) group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because the NMR has a 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H, which would fit a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a sec-butyl group.

So, let's think about a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. No, wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) connected to something. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- connected to the main group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group. Let me think about how that would split the NMR peaks.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene, then the CH2 would be next to the ring. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached to it.

Let me try to break it down:

The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But wait, if it's a benzoic acid, the substituent would be attached to the ring as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. No, that would make it a longer chain, but perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a 3-methylbutyl group or something.

Wait, the NMR for the substituent would have:

- The terminal CH3 would appear as a triplet at around 0.9 ppm (as it's attached to a CH2 group).
- The adjacent CH2 would show up as a quartet around 1.7 ppm, but wait, the given is a multiplet at 1.7 ppm for 2H. Hmm, maybe the CH2 is part of a larger structure.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a propyl group, but with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group, but that would give a triplet for the terminal CH3, but the other groups would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let's consider that.

An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, attached to the benzene, it would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, that doesn't fit because then the COOH would be further away. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH2CH3), and then connected to the ring.

Wait, but how does that fit with the NMR?

Let me consider the substituent as a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. But then the COOH would be attached to the CH2, which is attached to the benzene. Wait, no, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group attached to the benzene. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group but with a branch. Let me think again.

The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm: 1H (maybe a CH next to a carbonyl).
- 1.7 ppm: 2H (maybe a CH2 adjacent to the CH).
- 1.4 ppm: 3H (a methyl attached to a CH).
- 0.9 ppm: 3H (a terminal CH3).

So perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituent as a (CH2)2CH group. So for example, benzene-(CH2)3COOH. But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm, a quartet for the adjacent CH2 at around 1.7 ppm, and a triplet for the next CH2 around 2.9 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)1CH(CH2CH3) group. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but then the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached, which would show as a triplet for the CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, such as a 2-methylpropyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let's think about the structure of a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, so attached to the benzene, it would look like benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be right because the substituent needs to be attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

The benzene is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In that case, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached, which would appear as a triplet in the NMR for the CH2CH3, but perhaps that's not matching the given data.

Wait, perhaps it's better to try to draw this out mentally.

The substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes a carbonyl group (since the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl). So if the substituent is attached to the benzene as a carbonyl group, like Ph-CO-R, where R is some alkyl group.

In that case, the R group would be connected to the carbonyl. So the R group would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps as R-CO-CH2-CH(...).

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group. So Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH2 group attached to a methyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl group. So, something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)-CO-Ph.

Wait, but then the NMR would have peaks for the CH2 groups and the methyl.

Another approach: Let's consider the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is a Clemmensen reduction. So Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So Compound X is a ketone, and after reduction, it becomes an alkane.

Wait, but the product options are all either benzoic acids or alkanes. Wait, for option C, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a benzoic acid. Option A is a propanoic acid with an ethylphenyl group. Options B and D are alkanes (aromatic alkanes).

So, if the reaction is Clemmensen reduction (which reduces ketones to alkanes), then the starting material (Compound X) is a ketone, and the product would be an alkane.

Looking at the options, B and D are alkanes. So perhaps the product is either B or D.

Wait, but let me re-examine the IR and NMR data. The IR of Compound X has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a carbonyl. If it's a ketone, after reduction, the carbonyl becomes a methylene group (CH2). So the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

So, let's see. Suppose Compound X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent that includes a ketone, say, 4-(something)phenylpropanone.

Wait, but looking at the options after reduction:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 1, but that's not possible because benzene is symmetric. Alternatively, it's 4-isobutyl-1-methylbenzene, but the numbering would make it the same as 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, same issue with numbering.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent positions wrong. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the options are:

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: So benzene with a methyl group at position 1 and an isobutyl group at position 4. But for a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other, so this would be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: methyl and isobutyl.

But looking at the NMR data of Compound X, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests that the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has only one substituent. So if Compound X is a para-substituted benzene with a ketone group, then after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, leading to a structure like para-(something)benzene.

Wait, but in that case, let me look back at the options. None of the options A, B, C, D have two substituents on the benzene. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzophenone with a substituent on the ring. For example, 4-(something)phenyl-2-propanone.

Wait, but let's think again. Let me try to construct the structure.

Compound X has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a ketone group. So the substituent is R-CO- attached to the benzene, and R is an alkyl group.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe this is the O-H of a carboxylic acid, but wait, if it's a ketone, then that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but then the IR would show the aldehyde C-H stretch around 2800 cm-1, which I'm not seeing.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the 10.5 peak. Let me think again. If it's a ketone, then what would show up at 10.5 ppm? That's a high chemical shift. Maybe an aldehyde proton, but if it's a ketone, why would there be an aldehyde? Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 peak is an acidic proton, like from a phenol. But then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch, which it does (3400–2500 cm-1), which could include a phenol O-H.

Wait, but then the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl group, which could be an aromatic ketone (like a benzophenone), but if it's a phenol, then the substituent would be a hydroxyl group, but that wouldn't explain the 1720 cm-1 peak.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

If the reaction is Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, then the starting material (Compound X) must be a ketone. The product will have an alkane group where the ketone was.

So, looking at the options, the products are either alkanes or benzoic acids. Only options B and D are alkanes, so the product must be one of them.

So, the reaction reduces a ketone to an alkane. So what's the starting material before reduction?

Suppose the starting material is a benzene ring with a ketone group attached, along with a substituent that includes a CH2 group. For example, 4-(something)phenylpropan-2-one.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR data again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. The 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a branch in the substituent.

Perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is isobutyl. Let me think.

If the substituent is a ketone, say, (4-isobutylphenyl)propan-2-one. So, the structure would be:

Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, if it's (4-isobutylphenyl)propan-2-one, then the substituent on the benzene is a propanone group with an isobutyl substituent.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a ketone group attached to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a ketone, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group. So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try to sum up.

So, after Clemmensen reduction, the ketone becomes a methylene group (CH2), so the substituent would change from R-CO- to R-CH2-.

If the starting material is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzophenone, then after reduction, it would become 4-(propan-2-yl)benzyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone. Then, after reduction, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Hmm, that's benzene with a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. But why would the reduction lead to that?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a substituted acetophenone. For example, 4-(something)acetophenone. Then, after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, leading to 4-(something)ethylbenzene.

Wait, but the options don't show ethyl groups. Let me look back.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So that's benzene with a methyl at position 4 and an isobutyl at position 1.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: that would be benzene with a methyl at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

So, if the starting material (Compound X) is a ketone, say, 4-methyl-1-(sec-propenyl)benzene? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-methylacetophenone. The structure would be benzene with a methyl at position 4 and a propan-2-one group at position 1.

Wait, that would mean the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making it a para-substituted benzene. But in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests that there are two substituents in the para position, but that doesn't fit with the given options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data again.

If the substituent is a ketone group (R-CO-) attached to the benzene, then the R group would have a structure that gives the NMR signals mentioned.

Looking at the substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Perhaps a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, like R-CO-CH2-CH(...).

Wait, wait. Let me imagine R is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.9 ppm (but that's 1H, so maybe it's a CH, not CH2).
- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached, which would appear as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and the adjacent CH2 would show up around 1.7 ppm (2H), and the terminal methyl as a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

So that fits the substituent's NMR.

So the substituent R would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the structure of Compound X would be benzene with a substituent at position 4 as R-CO-, where R is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure would be 4-(propan-2-yl)benzophenone? Or perhaps more accurately, 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzophenone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me write this out.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CHCH2CH3, but that seems too long.

Wait, another approach: the substituent after reduction would become a CH2 group. So the R group in R-CO- would become R-CH2-.

Looking at the options, the product after reduction would be 4-(something)benzene with a CH2 group.

Wait, the options B and D are both 1-substituted and 4-substituted benzene rings, but that's impossible because in benzene, positions 1 and 4 are para. So, in actuality, they would both be in the same position. So perhaps the correct option is that the substituent is in the para position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the reaction.

If Compound X is a ketone, say, (4-ethylphenyl)propan-2-one, then after reduction, it would become (4-ethylphenyl)propane, which would be a substituted toluene derivative.

But looking at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which is an acid, so that's not the product of Clemmensen reduction. Option C is a benzoic acid, which also wouldn't be the product.

Options B and D are alkanes. So, the product must be either B or D.

So, the starting material must be a ketone attached to a benzene ring, and the substituent would be such that after reduction, it becomes either isobutyl or sec-butyl.

Wait, let's consider option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would imply a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. But in reality, benzene doesn't have a position 1; all positions are relative. So, perhaps it's benzene with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be at positions 1 and 4, but that's the same as being para to each other. So, perhaps the correct structure is 4-methyl-1-(sec-butyl)benzene, which would have substituents at the para positions.

So, the starting material would be a para-substituted acetophenone derivative. For example, the starting material might be 4-methyl-1-(sec-propenyl)benzophenone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-methyl-1-(propan-2-yl)benzophenone. So, the substituent on the benzene is a propan-2-yl group attached to a ketone.

After reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, so the substituent becomes propan-2-yl attached via a CH2 group.

Wait, but the product would then have a CH2 group attached to the benzene, leading to a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the substituent after reduction.

The NMR data of Compound X has a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H), which suggests a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group attached to the benzene via a carbonyl group.

In that case, the substituent would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

After reduction, the carbonyl becomes a CH2, so the substituent becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to fit any of the options.

Wait, looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The structure would be benzene with a methyl at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. But in reality, the positions are para, so it would be a benzene with two substituents in the para positions: a methyl and a sec-butyl group.

So, the starting material would have a methyl group and a ketone group attached to the benzene in para positions.

Wait, but the NMR data for Compound X shows a single peak for the aromatic protons, two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests only one substituent on the benzene ring, not two. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps Compound X has only one substituent on the benzene ring, which includes a ketone and a side chain.

So, the substituent would be R-CO- attached to the benzene, where R is a chain that includes a branch.

In that case, the structure would be benzene with a substituent like R-CO-, with R being a chain that gives the NMR signals we're seeing.

So, R would have:

- A CH group next to the carbonyl (2.9 ppm, m, 1H)
- A CH2 group after that (1.7 ppm, m, 2H)
- A CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H)
- And a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H)

So, the R group would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that makes R a pentyl group with a branch? Hmm.

Wait, no, that's four carbons. Let me see: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a 3-pentyl group? Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps R is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a (CH2)2CH group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: the substituent R is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the carbonyl.

So, the structure would be benzene-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have the following NMR signals:

- The CH would appear around 2.9 ppm (1H, m), as observed.
- The adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (2H, m).
- The terminal CH3 would be around 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be the case if there's a CH(CH3) group. Hmm, perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps R is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would give more protons than what's observed.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a (CH2)1CH(CH3)CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps R is (CH2)1CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. No, that seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a (CH2)1CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the substituent as a propyl group with a branch, such as a 2-methylpropyl group.

So, R would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's a 3-methylbutyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But that wouldn't fit the NMR.

Wait, the NMR data for the substituent:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe a CH next to carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → adjacent CH2.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H) → methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H) → terminal CH3.

So, perhaps the substituent R is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, which would be a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps R is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent would be benzene-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In that case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.9 ppm (1H, m), the CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH2 group next to it (appearing at 1.7 ppm, m, 2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would then be a methyl attached to the CH(CH2CH3), but that doesn't fit because CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH2CH3 group, which is a triplet, not a doublet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH that is adjacent to an oxygen (like in an ether), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH2CH3.

So, R would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's an isobutyl group.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group with a branch. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, R would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)1CH(CH3)CH2 group, leading to a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would be a 3-methylbutyl group, perhaps.

Wait, if R is a 3-methylbutyl group, then the substituent would be benzene-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a pentyl group with a branch.

Hmm, but the NMR data doesn't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, R is CH(CH2CH2CH3).

In that case, the substituent would be benzene-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

But then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have neighboring CH2 groups, leading to specific splitting patterns.

Wait, the CH2CH2CH3 group would give a triplet at 0.9 ppm (for the terminal CH3), and the adjacent CH2 would give a quartet around 1.7 ppm, but the given data shows a multiplet at 1.7 ppm for 2H, which could fit.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would need to come from a methyl group attached to a CH, but in this case, the CH has a CH2CH2CH3 group attached, not a methyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the product options again.

The product after Clemmensen reduction is an alkane. So, looking at options B and D:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4. But that's not possible; the substituents would be para to each other, so it's just a benzene with two substituents in para positions.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Same issue; it's actually a benzene with a methyl at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1, which are para to each other.

So, the product would have two substituents on the benzene ring, which would mean the starting material also had two substituents. But the NMR data for Compound X suggests only one substituent on the benzene, as there are two doublets each integrating to 2H, indicating a single substituent causing the splitting.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Wait, another possibility: Compound X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a ketone group elsewhere. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is a benzene ring with a ketone group and an alkyl chain that gives the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH(CH3) group. Let me see:

The substituent would be benzene-CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In this case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would appear at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the next CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That fits the NMR data.

So, after reduction, the ketone (CO) becomes a CH2 group. So the substituent becomes benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that would give a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, the substituent after reduction would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but then the chain ends there.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, so after reduction, it becomes (CH2)2CH(CH3).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the product structure.

If the substituent after reduction is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene, then the product would be 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzene, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be benzene with a methyl at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. But in reality, that's the same as having two substituents in the para positions.

But earlier, the NMR data suggests only one substituent on the benzene ring, so perhaps the starting material had only one substituent, a ketone group with a chain that includes a methyl and other groups.

I think I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to make a decision based on the options and the reaction.

The reaction converts a ketone to a CH2 group. So, if the starting material has a ketone group attached to a benzene with a substituent that becomes a sec-butyl group after reduction, then the product would be option D.

Looking at the NMR data, the substituent's chain includes a CH(CH3) and a CH2CH3, which would be consistent with a sec-butyl group.

So, the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which indicates a Clemmensen reduction. This reaction reduces a ketone group to a methylene group (CH₂). The IR and NMR data of Compound X provide clues about its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests an O-H stretch, likely from a hydroxyl group or an aldehyde.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely an aldehyde proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group.

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a ketone group and a side chain. The side chain includes:
- A CH group at 2.9 ppm.
- A CH₂ group at 1.7 ppm.
- A methyl group at 1.4 ppm (doublet), indicating it is attached to a CH.
- A terminal methyl group at 0.9 ppm (triplet).

This side chain corresponds to a **sec-butyl group**. Thus, Compound X is likely **4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The Clemmensen reduction converts the ketone group (C=O) into a methylene group (CH₂). Therefore, the product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzene**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Contains a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the Clemmensen reduction.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect because the reduction would not produce an isobutyl group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Contains a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the Clemmensen reduction.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct, as it matches the expected product after the reduction of the ketone group.
