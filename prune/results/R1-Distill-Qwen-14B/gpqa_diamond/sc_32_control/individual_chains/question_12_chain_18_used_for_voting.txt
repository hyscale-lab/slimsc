Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each with two values, probably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, we usually use conservation of energy and momentum. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. I think neutrinos have very small rest masses, and in many cases, they're considered massless or treated as such for simplification. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the neutrino's mass. Oh right! Because the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles' masses, especially in high-energy physics. So we can approximate the neutrino as massless.

So for the muon, its mass is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is treated as massless. So let's denote the four-momenta.

The initial four-momentum of the Pi(+) is its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV, and since it's at rest, the momentum is zero.

After decay, the total energy must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The total momentum must also be zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p.

For the muon, its energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, but units here are in MeV and MeV/c units. Hmm. Maybe it's easier to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

So, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and the neutrino's energy E_nu is |p|, since m_nu is approximately zero.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

So substituting, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2), E_nu = p.

So, sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Left side: p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Right side: (139.6 - p)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p^2.

Subtracting the right side from the left:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

Cancel p^2 from both sides.

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Now, I can compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

105.7 squared is approximately 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute:

105 * 105 = 11,025.

But 105.7 squared is (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6 squared. Let's compute 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So putting numbers:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 p.

Let's rearrange:

2 * 139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: 

19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Subtract the numbers:

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49) 

Wait, 0.16 - 0.49 is negative, so we'll need to borrow.

Wait, better to do it as:

19488.16
-11172.49
=?

Let me compute digit by digit.

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49).

But 0.16 - 0.49 is negative, so let's adjust.

Alternatively, 19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488.16 - 11172) - 0.49.

Wait:

19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16.

Then subtract 0.49: 8316.16 - 0.49 = 8315.67.

Yes, so 8315.67.

So, 2 * 139.6 p = 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6)

Compute denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Let me do 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is a bit more than 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ let's see:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.8 + 0.783 ≈ 30.583? Wait, no, wait that can't be right. Because 279.2 *30 is 8376 which is larger than 8315.67. So 30 is too high.

Wait, maybe better to do the division properly.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

As before, subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 → approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

Then, 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute 218.87 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 × 0.78 = ?

0.7 × 279.2 = 195.44.

0.08 × 279.2 = 22.336 → total 217.776.

Which is close to 218.87. The difference is 218.87 - 217.776 = 1.094.

So 1.094 / 279.2 ≈ ~0.0039.

So total is approximately 0.78 + 0.0039 = 0.7839.

So p≈29.7839 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if p is 29.78 MeV/c, then the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2 → approximately 886.6.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.6 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.09) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

E_nu is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

So total energy would be 109.81 + 29.78 = 139.59 MeV, which is about 139.6. Okay, that checks out.

Wait, but what are we trying to find? The kinetic energies of the product particles.

Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

So for the muon:

KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And for the neutrino, since its rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8

B) 7.2, 32.8

C)3.52, 20.8

D)4.12, 29.8

Hmm, my calculation gives KE_mu ≈4.11 MeV and KE_nu ≈29.78 MeV. So that would correspond to option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Because when the Pi is at rest, the muon and neutrino are moving in opposite directions. So the neutrino's momentum is p, and the muon's is also p, but in opposite direction. Because the total momentum must be zero.

Wait, but in the equation, I assumed that E_nu is p, but wait, neutrino's energy is |p| (since m=0, E = p c). So yes, E_nu = p.

Wait, but earlier calculation of p gives 29.78 MeV/c, which would make E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Hmm, but according to the initial equation, that's correct.

Wait another thing, because in the decay, the muon's kinetic energy is (E_mu - m_mu), which is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is E_nu, which is 29.78 MeV.

So that would make option D correct.

But let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing p.

Wait, let's recompute p.

So, p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 *139.6)

Wait wait, no. Wait, the equation I set up was:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = M_pi.

So, sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = M_pi - p.

Then, square both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p + p^2.

Cancelling p^2: m_mu^2 = M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p.

So, 2 M_pi p = M_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

Thus, p = [ M_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ] / (2 M_pi )

Ah, that's a simpler way to compute it.

So, p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Which is (a^2 - b^2) = (a-b)(a+b).

So a=139.6, b=105.7.

a - b = 33.9.

a + b = 245.3.

So numerator = 33.9 * 245.3.

Compute 33.9 * 245.3.

Let me compute 33 * 245 = 8115.

0.9 * 245 = 220.5.

So 33.9 *245 = 8115 + 220.5 = 8335.5.

Wait, but wait, 33.9 * 245.3.

Wait, 33.9 *245.3 = 33.9 * (245 + 0.3) = 33.9 *245 + 33.9 *0.3.

33.9 *245: 33 *245 = 8115, 0.9 *245 = 220.5 → 8115 +220.5=8335.5.

33.9 *0.3=10.17.

So total is 8335.5 +10.17=8345.67.

So numerator is 8345.67 MeV^2.

Denominator is 2 *139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8345.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Compute 279.2 * 30 =8376 → which is larger than 8345.67.

So 8345.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.81 MeV/c.

Wait, but 279.2 *29.8 = ?

279.2 *29= 8096.8.

279.2 *0.8=223.36.

So 29.8 → 8096.8 +223.36 = 8320.16.

But 8345.67 is more than that. Difference is 8345.67 - 8320.16=25.51.

So 25.51 /279.2 ≈ ~0.0913.

So 29.8 +0.0913=29.8913 → approximately 29.89 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.89 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p ≈29.89 MeV.

E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) → sqrt(29.89^2 + 105.7^2 )

29.89^2 = (30 -0.11)^2 =900 -2*30*0.11 +0.11² =900-6.6 +0.012=893.412.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So sum is 893.412 +11172.49 =12065.90.

sqrt(12065.9) ≈ 109.84 MeV.

So E_mu is ~109.84 MeV.

Now, KE for muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.84 -105.7=4.14 MeV.

And neutrino's KE is E_nu=29.89 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

That's very close to what I calculated (4.14 and 29.89).

So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

### Given:
- The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary and decays into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)).
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Neutrino is treated as massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal.
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is equal to its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the decay must be equal. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero:
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_\nu = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_\nu|.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino:
The energy of the muon is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal to the neutrino's momentum, \(p_\nu = p\)).

The energy of the neutrino is:
\[
E_\nu = p,
\]
since the neutrino is massless.

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Let \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). Substituting:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.89 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon:
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p = 29.89 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.89^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
29.89^2 = 893.41, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{893.41 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12065.9} \approx 109.84 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon:
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.84 - 105.7 = 4.14 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:
The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.89 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.14 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.89 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Answer: D
