Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where it's complexed with EDTA. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and this is probably a solubility or complex ion formation problem.

The solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I think that means the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. And they give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so maybe I don't have to worry about H+ ion interference. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

So, the complex is CaY^2-, right? Where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The dissociation of this complex would be Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-. The formation constant, K, is for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

Wait, but here, the problem states that the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, so I can think of it as the concentration of CaY²− being 0.02 M. Then, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

So the reaction is CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The equilibrium expression would be K = [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−]. But wait, the given K is the formation constant, which is for the formation of the complex. So the formation constant K is equal to [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5x10^10. So the expression for the formation is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). 

But in the dissociation of the complex, the equilibrium expression would be 1/K = ([Ca²+][Y^4−])/[CaY²−]. So, given that, I can set up the equation.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociates. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal, then [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M. Because the complex is very stable (since K is large), very little dissociates. So, the [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] will be small.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−, [Y^4−] would also be x. Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the stoichiometry is 1:1 here. So yes, [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x.

So, plugging into the expression for K:

K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x².

So, I can solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = 4e-13 / 1e1? No, wait, 5e10 is 5*10^10. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this. The other options are way off. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. K is 5e10. So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²). So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 → 2/(5e12) → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 → 6.32e-7. Yep, that's option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming minimal dissociation due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), we approximate \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) (and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\)) at equilibrium be \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
