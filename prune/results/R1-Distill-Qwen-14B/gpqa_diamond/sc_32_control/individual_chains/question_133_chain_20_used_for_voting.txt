Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. We have a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so probably room temperature.

Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-. Hmm, but let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. It can dissociate in steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

Orthophosphate ions, I think, refer to HPO4^2- because that's the second dissociation step. Or wait, sometimes "orthophosphate" refers to PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check that later.

The given K_a values are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So Ka1 is for the first dissociation, Ka2 for the second, and Ka3 for the third.

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are the sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate. So, when these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate into ions.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, it gives two Na+ per formula unit).

So when these two salts are present in the solution, they both contribute phosphate species. So the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to figure out whether orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or another form.

Wait, maybe orthophosphate is PO4^3-? No, because the first dissociation gives H2PO4^- (which is dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So orthophosphate would be PO4^3-.

But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. Because the salts we're adding are the first and second dissociation products. So would the orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) be negligible?

Wait, but the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, because those two are conjugate acid and base, right? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base), and their Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So the solution is a buffer solution.

In a buffer solution, the concentration of each species depends on the amounts of the acid and base. But since we are adding both the acid (KH2PO4) and the conjugate base (Na2HPO4), the solution should be a buffer. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, but if HPO4^2- is present, can it dissociate further into PO4^3-? The third dissociation has a very small Ka, 1.8e-12. So that would mean that PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. Since Ka3 is so small, the concentration of PO4^3- would be extremely low compared to HPO4^2-.

But the question is asking for orthophosphate ions. So depending on what orthophosphate is, if it's PO4^3-, then it's going to be a very tiny concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, I should probably clarify what orthophosphate refers to. From what I remember, when people say orthophosphate, they often mean the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The major species are these two, based on the salts. So the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- via Ka3, but since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

So the question is to find [PO4^3-], the orthophosphate ion concentration.

But how to calculate that? Let's think.

First, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

But wait, the salts also contribute other ions. But since the problem is only about phosphate ions, I can ignore the K+ and Na+ because they are spectator ions.

So let's compute the moles of each salt.

First, moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

It dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-, so moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007343 mol.

Second, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005610 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2- (since formula is Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-). So moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005610 mol.

Now, the total volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M ≈ 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but in solution, these two can interconvert. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and vice versa. So the presence of both might imply that the solution is a buffer, and the pH can be determined. But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution will have all three species: H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But given that the third dissociation is so weak (Ka3 is 1.8e-12), the [PO4^3-] will be very small.

But wait, how do these ions relate? HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. So the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the Ka3 and the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H+.

But to find [PO4^3-], I can use the expression for Ka3.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But I don't know [H+] yet. So I need to find the pH of the solution first.

Wait, the solution is a buffer because we have H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base) in significant amounts. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

Where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Let me calculate that.

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈ 7.0916.

So pH is about 7.09.

Now, knowing [H+], which is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.09 is about 0.81, so 8.1e-8 M.

So [H+] is approximately 8.13e-8 M.

Now, going back to the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/ [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

[H+] is 8.13e-8 M.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.13e-8)

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.13e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.13e-8 = approximately 6.21e-7 M.

Wait, 5e-14 / 8e-8 is 5/(8) * 1e-6 → 0.625e-6 → 6.25e-7.

Wait, but our numbers are 5.049e-14 divided by 8.13e-8.

So 5.049 / 8.13 ≈ 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 → 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1 g /136.09 g/mol.

1 / 136.09 → let me compute exactly. 136.09 is approximately 136.1.

1 /136.1 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Same as before.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 → 1 /177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Henderson equation:

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02805 / 0.036715) → 0.02805 / 0.036715 is approx 0.764.

Log(0.764) = let's compute more accurately.

Log(0.764) → let me think. Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.76) is perhaps around -0.117, and 0.764 is a bit higher, so maybe around -0.116. So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.116 = 7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) → 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.0916) is about 10^(-0.09)= about 0.81. So 8.1e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.13e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.13e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.049 /8.13) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.13 ≈ 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 = 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. Hmm, our calculation is 6.21e-7, which is very close to option A. Perhaps due to more precise calculations, the exact value would be a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So [base]/[acid] = 0.02805 /0.036715.

0.02805 ÷ 0.036715 = let me compute.

0.02805 ÷ 0.036715 = (28.05e-3) / (36.715e-3) = 28.05/36.715.

28.05 ÷ 36.715 → 28.05 ÷36.715 ≈ 0.764.

But let me compute it more accurately.

28.05 /36.715 → approximately 0.764.

So yes, log(0.764) is about -0.116.

pH = 7.2076 -0.116 → 7.0916.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0916) → let me compute it accurately.

Using a calculator approach: 7.0916 = 7 + 0.0916.

10^(-7) = 1e-7.

10^(-0.0916) → Let me compute log(10^x)=0.0916 → x = 0.0916.

Wait, 10^0.0916 → Wait no, it's 10^(-0.0916) = 1/(10^0.0916).

What's 10^0.0916? Since 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.2 (since log(1.2)=0.07918).

Wait, 0.0916 is a bit higher. Let's see:

Compute 10^0.0916: Let's take natural logs.

ln(10^0.0916) = 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2108.

e^0.2108 ≈ 1.234.

So 10^0.0916 ≈ 1.234 → 10^(-0.0916) ≈ 1 /1.234 ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.810 → 8.1e-8 M.

So that part is correct.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.1e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.1e-8.

So 5.049e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.049 /8.1) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.1 = approximately 0.623.

Wait, 8.1 * 0.623 = 5.0463, which is a bit less than 5.049, so perhaps 0.623 is accurate.

So 0.623e-6 = 6.23e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

But wait, another thought: the initial assumption is that the solution is a buffer, and the HPO4^2- comes only from Na2HPO4·2H2O. But does the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 affect the HPO4^2-?

Wait, in the solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid and donate a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the presence of H2PO4^- would increase the HPO4^2- concentration, but that's already accounted for in the buffer calculation. Wait, but actually, the buffer equation already considers both the acid and the base forms. So the [HPO4^2-] remains as calculated, because it's in a buffer system where their ratio determines the pH.

Hmm, unless the salts themselves contribute some H+ or OH- ions beyond that, but since they're just dissociating into phosphate ions, I think the initial approach is correct.

So the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which aligns with option A (6.24e-7 M).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of H₃PO₄ and the contributions of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution is a buffer system containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the third dissociation step (HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ PO₄³⁻ + H⁺) governed by the very small Ka₃ value of 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = mass / molecular weight = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.  
  This contributes 0.007343 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = mass / molecular weight = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol.  
  This contributes 0.005610 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
- [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007343 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.0367 M.  
- [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005610 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02805 M.

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2×10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.2076.  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.2076 - 0.116 = 7.0916
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [H⁺]
From pH = 7.0916, [H⁺] = 10⁻⁷.₀⁹¹⁶ ≈ 8.13×10⁻⁸ M.

### Step 5: Use the Ka₃ expression to find [PO₄³⁻]
The third dissociation is governed by:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8×10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.13×10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049×10^{-14}}{8.13×10^{-8}} \approx 6.21×10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately **6.21×10⁻⁷ M**, which matches option **A (6.24×10⁻⁷ M)** closely due to rounding differences.

Answer: A
