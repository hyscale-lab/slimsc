Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to figure out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime (or the time) of a particle with absolute precision. The principle is often written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but when I'm trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for them to be distinguishable. So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is about ħ divided by the lifetime (Δt). Oh, right, because ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

Let me jot that down. So ΔE = ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. But wait, the lifetimes given are for each state. Wait, but in the problem, each state has its own lifetime. Hmm, do I use the smallest or the largest lifetime here?

Wait, no. The uncertainty in the lifetime of each state would affect the uncertainty in the energy. So for each state, their energy has an uncertainty. But when the two are being compared, the total uncertainty in their energy difference would probably be related to the sum or the maximum of their individual uncertainties?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps the uncertainty in their difference is the same as the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the energy uncertainty of each state that matters. If each state has a certain ΔE, then the difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual ΔEs so that they don't overlap in their possible energy ranges.

Wait, no. The energy difference ΔE between the two states should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, their energy levels would overlap, making them indistinguishable.

So, for each state, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. Let's compute that for each.

First, the Planck constant. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, but the problem is in eV, so I need to convert J to eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So, ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ let me compute that. 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 = let's see, 1e-34 * 6e18 = 6e-16, but more accurately:

1.0545718 * 6.242 ≈ about 6.582. So 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, compute ΔE for each state.

For the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16) / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, no. Wait, 1e-8 is 10^-8, so 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but these are the uncertainties in each state's energy. When considering the energy difference between the two states (ΔE_total = E2 - E1), the uncertainty in this difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because the energies are uncertain by their own ΔE.

Wait, no. Because when you're subtracting two energies, the uncertainties add in quadrature, but perhaps for an order-of-magnitude estimate, we can just sum them.

Alternatively, the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps the maximum of the two, but I think it's additive.

Wait, let's think. Let's say E1 is uncertain by ΔE1, and E2 is uncertain by ΔE2. Then the difference ΔE is (E2 ± ΔE2) - (E1 ± ΔE1) = (E2-E1) ± (ΔE1 + ΔE2). So the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than this sum for them to be distinguishable.

So ΔE >= (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let's compute that.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

Adding them: 6.58e-7 +6.58e-8 = 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute 7.24e-7 eV is 0.000000724 eV, which is 7.24e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that is acceptable.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, much bigger than 7e-7 eV, so it's acceptable.

But wait, let me double-check. Because perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So for the two states, the energy difference's uncertainty is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So for the energy levels to be distinguishable, ΔE must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 7e-7 eV, so yes, it's sufficient.

Option D is 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 7e-7 eV, so insufficient.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be distinguishable, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of a state is approximately equal to the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

The reduced Planck constant is approximately \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states, the lifetimes are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for each state are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
