Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's not in a pure state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to get a better picture. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are eigenvectors with eigenvalues 1/2 each. So, the matrix should look like:

(1/2) [ |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix where both diagonal elements are 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), which determine the point on the unit sphere.

But wait, the Bloch sphere is typically for pure states. What about mixed states? Oh right, for a mixed state described by a density matrix, the Bloch representation involves something called the "Bloch vector," but I'm not entirely sure how that's calculated.

Wait, another approach: any single-qubit density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space. Let's unpack that.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, if I can express ρ in terms of these, perhaps I can find the components of r.

Let's compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 and see what r would be.

Our given ρ is (1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]], which is the same as (I)/2, because I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So, if I set ρ equal to (I + sum r_i σ_i )/2, then:

( I + r·σ ) / 2 = (1/2) I.

Multiplying both sides by 2:

I + r·σ = I.

Subtract I from both sides:

r·σ = 0.

So, the vector r must be such that when multiplied by the Pauli matrices and summed, the result is zero matrix. So, each coefficient r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. Because if r is non-zero, then the sum would have some terms. So, r must be (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait a second. The vector r in the Bloch sphere for a pure state is a unit vector. But for a mixed state, how does it work? Oh, I think the general formula is that any 2x2 density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a real vector and ||r|| ≤1. So in our case, since r·σ is zero, r must be zero vector.

So the Bloch vector is at the origin. So the geometrical position in the qubit space would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single-qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a real vector. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I \implies \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin. Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).**
