Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their atmospheres. Hmm, let me read through it again.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. I need to find the ratio of the ratios. So, ratio_no_spots divided by ratio_with_spots.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. And they're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so Boltzmann equation applies here.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the ratios. Let me think. So without spots, the Teff is 6000 K; with spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, that's the overall effective temperature. However, the spots are cooler regions, right? So when the star has spots covering 40% of its surface, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, no—the spots themselves are cooler, but the rest is hotter? Or does the overall Teff just drop, but the photosphere's temperature is a mix.

Wait, no. The problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So in this case, the photosphere must have a lower temperature when spots are present. So, the effective temperature of the whole star is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but in reality, the star's overall luminosity is the sum of the light from the spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem simplifies this by saying that the overall Teff is 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. So in this scenario, the entire photosphere's average effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps when the star has spots, the average flux is lower, so the effective temperature is lower. So the photosphere as observed has a lower temperature when spots are present.

But wait, the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So the photosphere's Teff is 5500 K when there are spots. So, the temperature of the photosphere (the atmosphere) is 5500 K in that case.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio is dependent on the temperature. So when the temperature decreases, how does the ratio n2/n1 change?

The energy levels are such that the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. The energy difference can be found using the wavelength. E = hc/λ. But maybe I don't need to calculate the exact energy, because it's just a constant, and the ratio will depend on the exponential term.

Wait, the ratio is n2/n1. If the temperature changes, the ratio changes as exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same.

Wait, without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, it's 5500 K. So the ratio without spots is higher or lower than with spots?

Well, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Let's say ΔE is positive (E2 > E1). So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So if T is higher (6000 K) than when it's 5500 K, the ratio n2/n1 should be higher when T is higher.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So in the question, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. That makes sense because the temperature is lower, so the ratio n2/n1 would be lower.

So when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio is lower.

The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So factor = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) ) ]

g2/g1 cancels out, so factor = exp( [ ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but wait: let's think about the exponents. The ratio without spots is at T1=6000 K, and with spots at T2=5500 K.

So the ratio is [n2/n1]_no_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

[n2/n1]_with_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, because -ΔE/(k T1) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) )

Wait, but let me compute that correctly.

The factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because:

= exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Which can be rewritten as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So let's compute that term.

But what's ΔE? It's E2 - E1, which is hc/λ multiplied by some factor, but since λ is given, I can compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed without knowing the exact value of ΔE, but using the temperature ratio.

Wait, but maybe I can express this in terms of reciprocal temperatures.

Let me compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But I need to compute this exponent.

Wait, but I don't have the value of ΔE. So perhaps I can express it in terms of the wavelength.

ΔE = hc / λ

So:

ΔE/(k) = (hc)/(k λ)

So the exponent becomes (hc)/(k λ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So factor = exp( (hc)/(k λ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

T1 = 6000 K

T2 = 5500 K

So let's compute the exponent.

First, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1):

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1

So 1.5151e-5 K^-1

Now compute (hc)/(k λ):

h c = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) = 1.9878e-25 J·m

k λ = (1.38e-23 J/K)(1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.999e-30 J·m

So (hc)/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.999e-30) ≈ 1e5 ≈ 10^5 (unitless?)

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

k λ = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448e-30 = (1.38 * 1.448) = approx 1.999e-30 J·m

So (h c)/(k λ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.999e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.999) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.999e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.999) * 1e5 ≈ 1.0 * 1e5 = 1e5.

So (h c)/(k λ) ≈ 1e5.

So the exponent is (1e5) * (1.5151e-5) ≈ 1.5151.

So factor = exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151 ≈ 4.55.

Wait, e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48. Let me compute 1.5151.

Let me compute 1.5151:

e^1.5151 ≈ ?

Compute 1.5151:

We know that e^1.6094 ≈ 5 (since ln(5)=1.6094). So 1.5151 is lower than that.

Alternatively, use the Taylor series or a calculator approximation.

But since I can't compute it exactly, I think it's approximately 4.55, which is close to option C) ~4.5.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So option C is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

But wait, I need to make sure I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, let me recheck the (h c)/(k λ) part.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1.448e-7 m

k*λ = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448e-30 = (approx) 1.998e-30 J·m

So (h c)/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.998e-30) = (1.9878 / 1.998) * 1e5 ≈ approx (0.995) * 1e5 ≈ 99500 ≈ 1e5.

So that's correct.

Then, the exponent is 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

So e^1.5151 ~ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann distribution into the factor expression, we get:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (temperature without spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (temperature with spots). The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \)
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \)
\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, \quad h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]
\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.399 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]
\[
k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}, \quad \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.399 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1.01 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (1.01 \times 10^5)(0.00001515) \approx 1.53.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.53) \approx 4.64.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, which corresponds to option **C**.
