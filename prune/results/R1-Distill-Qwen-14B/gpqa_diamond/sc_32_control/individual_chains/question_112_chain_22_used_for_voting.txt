Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |alpha> is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the z-projection of spin is measured as +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where each diagonal element is 0, and all off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. Wait, no—wait, the matrix elements A_ij are ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

The operator matrix would be:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Hmm. I think this operator is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So yeah, operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x. That makes sense because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, which are the spin projections along the x-axis, I believe.

So the eigenstates of this operator correspond to the spin eigenstates along the x-axis. So |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. 

Wait, but the question isn't directly about measuring spin along the x-axis. It's about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenstates of this operator. So we need to find the probability of the state being in each eigenstate of operator A.

Alternatively, maybe we can change the basis of |alpha> to the eigenbasis of A and find the probabilities.

But first, let's note that |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So we need to normalize this state first. Because the question says it's proportional; the actual state might have a normalization factor.

So step one: normalize |alpha>.

Let me calculate the norm of |alpha>. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product will be (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

|2 -i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, the state is properly normalized.

Next, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of operator A. Since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, let me confirm. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So when we express |alpha> in terms of these states, the coefficients will give us the probabilities.

So, perhaps I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and then find the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Let me write down the components of |alpha> in the computational basis (|up>, |down>):

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me express |alpha> in terms of these.

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So, substituting:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let me multiply both sides by sqrt(2) to simplify:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> * sqrt(2) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> * sqrt(2) = a (|up> + |down> ) + b (|up> - |down> )

Grouping terms:

|up> [ (1+i)sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) + b ] + |down> [ (2-i)sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) - a ] = (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down>

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set up equations for the coefficients a and b.

Expressing the equation:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ a + b ] / sqrt(2)
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ a - b ] / sqrt(2)

So, we have two equations:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (a + b)/sqrt(2)   ...(1)

(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (a - b)/sqrt(2)   ...(2)

We can add and subtract these equations to solve for a and b.

Adding (1) and (2):

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (2a)/sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: 1+2 + i -i =3.

So 3/sqrt(7) = 2a / sqrt(2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

a = [ 3/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)/2 ] = (3 sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtracting (2) from (1):

[ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (2b)/sqrt(2)

Compute numerator: 1-2 + i +i = (-1 + 2i)

So (-1 +2i)/sqrt(7) = 2b/sqrt(2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

b = [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

But wait, since |alpha> is expressed as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients a and b give the amplitudes. The probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First, a = [3 sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So |a|^2 = [9 * 2 ] / [4 * 7 ] = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Wait, 18/28 simplifies to 9/14, which is approximately 0.64286.

Then, for b:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

So |b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2 ] / [4 *7 ]

Compute numerator: (1 +4 ) *2 =5 *2=10.

Denominator: 4 *7=28.

So |b|^2=10/28=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Wait, but 9+5=14, so the sum is 14/14=1. That's correct.

But the options given don't seem to include these exact fractions. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt7

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt7

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt7.

Wait, but my a² is 9/14≈0.64286, which is approximately 0.64. The first option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64. So looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, but wait, my |a|² is 9/14≈0.6428, and |b|² is 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36. The sum is 1, so that's correct in approximation, but 0.3571 is about 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again for a.

Wait, a was (3 sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Then |a|² is (9 * 2) / (4 *7) = 18/(28)=9/14, which is about 0.64286.

Yes, so that's correct.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the problem statement, the operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, zero otherwise. So the matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Which is hbar/2 times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought.

So when expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients are a and b as above.

So the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

Wait, but let me make sure that |alpha> is expressed as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. So the probabilities are indeed |a|² and |b|².

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but look at the options: option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So that's the first part.

Then, the second part of the question is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we know the eigenstates of A, and the operator has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, the average would be |a|²*(hbar/2) + |b|²*(-hbar/2).

Wait, because |+x> has eigenvalue hbar/2, and |-x> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So compute <A> = |a|²*(hbar/2) + |b|²*(-hbar/2).

We have |a|²=9/14, |b|²=5/14.

So substituting:

(9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] (hbar/2 )

= (4/14)(hbar/2 ) = (2/7)(hbar/2 ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So option A's average value matches.

But wait, another approach: since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

The expectation value of sigma_x is (alpha_x | sigma_x | alpha_x ), but since sigma_x is the Pauli matrix.

The expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha> can be found by decomposing |alpha> into the sigma_x eigenbasis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> directly using the components.

Let me compute <A> as <alpha| A |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So the bra vector is (1-i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2+i)/sqrt(7) <down|.

The operator A is (hbar/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]].

So, let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix elements:

A_{11} = 0, A_{12}=A_{21}=hbar/2, A_{22}=0.

So when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it would be sum_i sum_j <alpha|_i A_{ij} |alpha>_j.

But since A is only non-zero for i≠j, the terms are A_{12} |alpha>_2 and A_{21} |alpha>_1.

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

The expectation value is:

= (1-i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2+i)/sqrt(7) <down| all multiplied by A, then multiplied by |alpha>.

But A operates on |alpha>, so let me compute A|alpha>.

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ [0 1; 1 0] ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

This results in (hbar/2) [ (2-i)/sqrt(7); (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So A|alpha> = [ (2-i) / sqrt(7) , (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T multiplied by hbar/2.

Then, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2-i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)), (1+i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^T

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term:

= (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Compute each part.

First term: (1-i)(2 - i) * (hbar)/(2 *7 )

(1)(2) = 2; (1)(-i) = -i; (-i)(2) =-2i; (-i)(-i)= +i²= -1.

So (1-i)(2-i)= 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1 +i) = 2*1=2; 2*i=2i; i*1=i; i*i= i²= -1.

So (2+i)(1+i)= 2 +2i +i +i² = 2+3i -1= 1+3i.

So summing the two terms:

(1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is [ 2 * hbar ] / (2*7) ) = hbar/(7).

Which matches what I got earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but the probabilities I calculated were |a|²=9/14≈0.64286 and |b|²=5/14≈0.3571.

Hmm, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is closer to 0.36. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let's look at the other options. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a and b. Let me recheck the setup.

When I set up the equations:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (a + b)/sqrt(2)   ...(1)

(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (a - b)/sqrt(2)   ...(2)

Adding equations (1) and (2):

( (1+i) + (2-i) ) / sqrt(7) = [ (a + b) + (a - b) ]/sqrt(2) → [3]/sqrt(7) = (2a)/sqrt(2) → a = [3 sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Which is correct.

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) = [ (a + b) - (a - b) ]/sqrt(2) → [ -1 + 2i ] / sqrt(7) = (2b)/sqrt(2) → b = [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So |a|² is (3^2 * 2) / (4 *7 )= 18/(28)=9/14 ≈0.64286.

|b|² is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) * 2 / (4 *7 ) → (1 +4)*2/(28)=10/28=5/14≈0.3571.

So probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.643) and 5/14 (0.357). So the closest option is A: 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, I'm looking at the options again. Option A says the average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D says average is 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is much bigger than hbar/7. So no, A is correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the operator A is represented differently. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the operator.

Wait, the operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Which is indeed (hbar/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates are indeed |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So everything so far seems correct.

So the correct option is A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), and its eigenstates are the spin eigenstates along the \( x \)-axis, denoted as \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). These eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) into the equations for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) such that:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations, we find:

\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) of \( A \), the expectation value becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
