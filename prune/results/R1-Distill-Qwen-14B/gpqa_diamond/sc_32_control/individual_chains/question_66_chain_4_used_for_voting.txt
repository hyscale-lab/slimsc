Okay, I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think each through.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means operators are built from Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields. So option 1 is definitely correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but in an effective field theory (EFT), the theory is usually considered to be invariant under the Poincare group. SMEFT is an EFT, so operators must respect Poincare. Oh wait, but wait. SMEFT is typically considered as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but EFTs are usually formulated in a Poincare-invariant way. However, sometimes when you have higher-dimension operators, like in SMEFT, you might have operators that are not Poincare-invariant? Or maybe they are. Because the Standard Model is Poincare-invariant, the SMEFT operators must preserve that. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. But wait, wait. Wait, Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare or just Lorentz?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry includes translations, rotations, boosts, etc. Lorentz is the subgroup excluding translations. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. But in EFTs, you usually work in a frame where translations are accounted for, but the operators themselves are local, so they should respect Poincare. Wait, but SMEFT operators are local, so they should be Poincare-invariant. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. So does SMEFT require operators to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or just Poincare?

Wait, I think all effective field theories are Poincare-invariant. So Poincare symmetry must be respected. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait but the options are numbered 1,2,3,4. So the question is about which of these must be respected. So both Lorentz and Poincare, so 1 and 2, which is option A. But wait, wait. No, wait. I think the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory but not necessarily a Poincare-invariant one. Because in SMEFT, the operators are classified under Lorentz symmetry. Wait, maybe Poincare isn't necessarily required because the theory is only defined up to a certain energy scale, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the operators are built from fields that are Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but I think that the SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So which one is it? Let me think of the structure. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's formulated in a Lorentz-invariant way, but whether it's Poincare-invariant depends on whether the theory includes global translations. But translations are part of the Poincare group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each symmetry implies. Lorentz symmetry is about local transformations (i.e., at each point in spacetime), while Poincare includes global transformations, like translations. So in an EFT, the operators don't have to respect Poincare because the theory is defined in a particular frame, perhaps. Or maybe the operators are constructed to be Poincare-invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT is only required to respect Lorentz and gauge symmetries, but not necessarily all of Poincare. Hmm, that's possible. For example, the Standard Model is Poincare-invariant, so SMEFT must extend that, so operators must respect Poincare. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Wait, but another approach: the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So which ones are absolute. Lorentz symmetry is a spacetime symmetry, and SMEFT operators must respect that, so 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: since it includes translations, which are global. But in an effective theory, perhaps the operators don't have to be invariant under translations because the theory is only valid up to a certain scale. Wait, but the effective theory should still be Lorentz and Poincare-invariant. Because in the Standard Model, which is part of SMEFT, the theory respects Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT is only required to respect Lorentz symmetry, not Poincare. I'm not sure. But let me think about the options. The options for the answers are A (1,2), which would be both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, another point: Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. The SMEFT operators are constructed from local fields, so they must be invariant under local transformations. Wait, no, local transformations are part of gauge symmetries, not Poincare. Hmm, perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a condition for the operators themselves, because the operators are local. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that all operators in the SMEFT are built as Lorentz-invariant operators. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincare includes translations, which don't affect the local structure of operators. So maybe Poincare symmetry isn't required for each operator, but the theory as a whole must respect Poincare. Or perhaps the question is that all operators must individually respect these symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators must be Poincare-invariant. Because if you have a term that isn't Poincare-invariant, it would be non-renormalizable but perhaps not allowed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe this is easier: Which symmetries are part of the SMEFT by default. So SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Lorentz, gauge, CPT, and CP-invariant (except for some models where CP is violated, but the SM as a whole has CPT symmetry). So SMEFT must also respect these. But wait, do all SMEFT operators have to respect all these symmetries? Or only the Standard Model symmetries?

Wait, in SMEFT, operators can violate certain symmetries. For example, operators can violate flavor symmetries, which is why SMEFT is useful for beyond the SM physics like FCNCs. But for the symmetries that the SM already respects, SMEFT operators must also respect them, unless the operator explicitly violates them. So, in the SM, CPT is a symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry, but they can violate other symmetries like CP if the operator dimension allows.

Wait, but I thought in the SM, the CKM matrix allows for CP violation. So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. Then, SMEFT operators can violate CP as well, which would mean that CP isn't necessarily a symmetry that SMEFT must respect. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry, then SMEFT operators don't have to respect it either. But wait, no, that's perhaps not the case. Let me think again.

The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. Because every particle has its antiparticle, etc. So SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry because the SM does. So CPT symmetry is a must. So option 4 is correct.

CP symmetry is trickier. The SM has some CP violation, so the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Therefore, not all operators in SMEFT respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

So now, the question is which of the four symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect.

So let's reevaluate. We have:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected, because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant. So yes.

2. Poincare Symmetry: As I'm confused about this, perhaps I should look for another approach. Poincare includes translations, which are global. For an effective theory, I think the operators don't need to respect global symmetries because the theory is only valid in a certain energy range. Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, meaning the theory must be Lorentz-invariant regardless of the energy scale. So Poincare symmetry isn't required for each operator, but the theory as a whole must respect Poincare. But the question is about each operator. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant? Or is it that the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant, meaning that the sum of operators respects it.

Wait, no. The sum of operators as part of a Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So each individual operator in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. Because if an operator is not Poincare-invariant, adding it would make the Lagrangian not Poincare-invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare as well. So 2 is correct.

Wait, but then why is Poincare not an option in combination with 1 and 4? Because the options are 1,2,4 for option C.

Wait, the question is which of the following must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So let's go through each option:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: must be respected, so yes.

2. Poincare Symmetry: each operator must be Poincare-invariant, so yes.

3. CP Symmetry: not necessarily, as SMEFT can have CP-violating operators.

4. CPT Symmetry: must be respected, because the SM is CPT-symmetric and SMEFT extends it. So yes.

Wait, but this would imply that 1, 2, and4 are correct, which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that Poincare is part of the requirement because each operator must be Poincare-invariant. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a condition because the operators are local, and translations are global. So each operator is a local term, so Poincare isn't a condition for each operator, but the overall theory must be Poincare-invariant. In that case, the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare. Because the sum of the operators would have to be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, no. Because each operator is part of the Lagrangian. For the Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, each term (operator) in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. Because if you have a term that's not Poincare-invariant, then the Lagrangian isn't Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 is correct.

So putting it together, which symmetries must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz: yes.

2. Poincare: yes.

4. CPT: yes.

3. CP: no.

So the correct answer would have 1,2,4. Which is option C.

But wait, in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CPT symmetry? Because the SM respects CPT, so SMEFT must as well. So yes, 4 is correct.

But wait, I thought the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, but it does have CPT symmetry. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT, but they can violate CP.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, 4: Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry in detail:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement because the Standard Model, which SMEFT extends, is Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and global translations. In effective field theories like SMEFT, the Lagrangian must be Poincaré-invariant, which implies that each individual operator in the Lagrangian must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not strictly respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in processes like electroweak interactions. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry either, as they can explicitly violate CP.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an extension, must also respect CPT symmetry. This is because CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum field theories, and its violation would lead to inconsistencies.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as SMEFT operators can violate it.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
