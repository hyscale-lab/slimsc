Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center, right? The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But wait, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Hmm. Okay, I need to visualize this.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties in electrostatics. Since the conductor is uncharged, initially, the charges inside would induce charges on the surfaces. But wait, inside the cavity, there's a charge q. So, the conductor was initially neutral. So when the charge q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor's material is a conductor, the charges would redistribute.

Wait, but the cavity isn't centered. The center of the cavity is s away from the conductor's center. So the induced charge on the inner surface isn't uniformly distributed, but I think that when considering fields outside the conductor, the induced charges on the inner surface might not contribute. Hmm, no, wait. The induced charges on the inner surface are due to the charge q in the cavity. But the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q, right? Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor was neutral, so the outer has +q.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, as the conductor's material is a conductor. Then, because the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q, and the total is zero, so the outer has +q.

But wait, the outer surface is a conductor, so its charge distribution... Hmm, but whether the point is outside the conductor, the field is determined by the charges outside, which would be the outer surface's charge. But wait, the outer surface's charge will distribute itself uniformly because the conductor is spherical. Or wait, no. The conductor itself is a sphere, but the cavity is off-center. So the outer surface might not be uniform. Wait, but no. The outer surface, being a conductor, will have the charge induced in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. But the conductor is neutral except for the induced charges.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the conductor. The conductor is uncharged. The cavity has a charge +q. The conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q, because the conductor's material must cancel the electric field inside. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) has -q. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface is -q, so the outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not centered. So the outer surface charge would be uniformly distributed because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Because, regardless of the inner cavity's position, the outer surface's charge will distribute uniformly. Because, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the surface charge density depends only on the charge and the geometry of the surface. So, s is the distance from the center, but the outer surface is a sphere, so its charge distribution is uniform.

So, when considering a point outside the conductor (like point P, which is outside), the electric field would be the same as if all the charge of the conductor were concentrated at its center. Because for a spherical charge distribution, the external field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge.

So, the total charge on the outer surface is +q. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, should be given by Coulomb's law, considering the charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait a second, but point P's distance from the conductor's center is L, but the charge q is in the cavity which is shifted by s from the center. Does the position of the charge in the cavity affect the external field?

Hmm. Because the cavity is not at the center, the inner induced charge is -q, but for the outer conductor, the induced charge is +q, but the outer charge is on the surface of the conductor, which is a sphere. So the field outside depends on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q, because the conductor was neutral, and the inner had -q, so the outer has +q.

Wait, but the conductor's charge is +q. So the external field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², right? Because point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the conductor's total charge is +q.

Wait, but what about the position of the charge q inside the cavity? So, the charge is not at the center of the conductor. So, from the perspective of point P, which is outside, does the position of q affect the field?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q uniformly distributed. So, the net charge outside is +q. So, the external field is as if all the charge were at the center.

But wait, let me think again. Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface of the conductor has an induced charge of -q, but since it's a conductor, the outer surface must have +q. But the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge distribution is uniform. So when calculating the field outside the conductor, you can treat it as a point charge at the center, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is. Because the outer surface's charge doesn't depend on the position of the internal charge, only on the total.

Wait, no, no, wait. The placement of the internal charge affects the inner surface's charge distribution. So, the inner surface's charge is -q, but it's not uniform because the cavity is off-center. So, the conductor's inner shell has a non-uniform charge. But the conductor's outer shell must have a uniform charge. Because, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. The charges in the outer surface rearrange themselves to ensure that.

Wait, but how does that happen when the cavity is not centered? Let's think. The inner surface charge is -q. The conductor's material responds to the internal charge and redistributes its charges. But the outer surface, being a conductor, must have a symmetrical charge distribution because any asymmetry would create an electric field within the conductor, which can't happen in equilibrium. So, the outer surface charge must be uniform.

So, the outer surface's charge is +q, uniformly distributed. So, the external field is the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the field at point P would be as if the charge is at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the position of point P in relation to the cavity's center? The question gives l as the distance from P to the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the two centers, and theta is the angle between l and s. Hmm, but if the conductor's charge is uniformly distributed and the field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface, then the position of P relative to the cavity shouldn't matter. Because the external field is only dependent on the total charge of the conductor, not on the internal arrangement.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's charge is +q, so the field outside is due to that. So, the answer should be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cavity's charge affects things. But no, because the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the field outside is due to that.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I made a mistake about the induced charges. Let me recap.

The conductor is initially neutral. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field within the conductor. Then, since the conductor itself was neutral (total charge zero), the outer surface must have +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0 → but wait, no, the conductor's initial charge is zero, so putting +q inside causes inner to be -q, and outer to be +q, so the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because the conductor's initial total charge is zero. So, when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q. Then, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's material is neutral, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q to balance, making the conductor's total charge zero.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The conductor's initial charge is zero. You place +q inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface must have -q, because the conductor must ensure that the electric field inside it is zero. The +q in the cavity would induce -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, what's the total charge of the conductor? The conductor's own charge is the sum of the inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface is -q, and the conductor must be neutral, so the outer surface must be +q. So, the outer surface has +q, uniformly distributed, because the conductor is a sphere. So, the field outside is due to the +q charge, and is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Therefore, the electric field at point P outside is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct option is B.

Wait, but what about the details given in the question? The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. Does that affect the field?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Because the outer charge is +q, but the conductor's geometry isn't a sphere because the cavity is off-center. So, the field outside isn't the same as a point charge at the center. Hmm, no, wait. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is spherical, regardless of the cavity's position. So, the field outside the conductor is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

So regardless of where point P is, as long as it's outside, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), where L is the distance from the conductor's center. So, the answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the radius of the cavity is $r$ ($r < R$). A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**:  
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor.  
   - Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **External Electric Field**:  
   - For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly because the conductor is spherical.  
   - The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
     \]  
     where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

3. **Relevance of Cavity Position**:  
   - The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity (offset by $s$) affects the distribution of charges on the inner surface of the conductor. However, the outer surface charge remains uniformly distributed because the conductor is spherical.  
   - The external electric field depends only on the total charge of the conductor ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to the point $P$. The details of the cavity's position (e.g., $l$, $s$, and $\theta$) do not affect the external field.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}\) is not relevant to the external field, as the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.  
- **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor is \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}\), consistent with Coulomb's law for a point charge at the center of the conductor.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}\) is not applicable, as the external field does not depend on the cavity's position.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}\) would only be valid if the charge were located at the cavity's center, but the field outside the conductor depends on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.

### Final Answer:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
