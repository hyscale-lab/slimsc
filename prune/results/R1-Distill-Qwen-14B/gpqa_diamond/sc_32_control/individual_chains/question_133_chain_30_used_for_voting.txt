Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200 cm³ and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is room temperature. The Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12, respectively.

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I'm a bit rusty on this. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But wait, the salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions. So in solution, they might form a buffer system, perhaps?

I remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But I need to think about the species present here. Let's break it down.

First, let's figure out the moles of each compound in the solution.

For KH2PO4: Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1/136.09 is approximately 0.00734 mol. Wait, let me get more precise. 136.09 is about 136.09, so 1/136.09 is about 0.00734. So, 0.00734 mol.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. So, the concentration of H2PO4^- from this is 0.00734 mol.

Then, the Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's compute its molar mass. Na is 23, O is 16, H is 1, and including the waters. So Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's see: Na2 is 2*23=46, HPO4 is H (1) + P (31) + 4 O (64) → 96. Then 2 H2O is 2*(2 H + 16 O) → 2*(18)=36. So 46 +96=142 +36=178 g/mol. Oh, the Mw given is 177.99, so about 178. So moles = 1.00 g / 178 g/mol ≈ 0.0056179 mol. So approximately 0.005618 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005618 mol.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is H3PO4. Or wait, no—orthophosphate is the H3PO4 form. But wait, in solution, H3PO4 can dissociate stepwise. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which are in a buffer system. So the pH of the solution will depend on the ratio of these two. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the system is a buffer between the second and first dissociation steps. So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2), which is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is for a conjugate acid-base pair. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But which is the acid and which is the base here? In the second dissociation, H2PO4^- (acid) donates a proton to become HPO4^2- (base). So the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the equation becomes pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-])

But wait, I don't know the pH yet. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH from the buffer, but wait, the question is about the concentration of H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. Since in solution, H3PO4 is present, but the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think. The problem says what's the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But in solution, it's going to dissociate. So the concentration of H3PO4 will be very low because it's a weak acid. So I need to calculate [H3PO4].

Wait, but how? Because in solution, H3PO4 is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and H+. So, the initial amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are from the salts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system as a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and then find the pH. Once I have the pH, I can calculate [H3PO4] using the Ka1 expression.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.

2. The solution volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L. So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.02809 / 0.0367).

Compute the ratio: 0.02809 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.

4. Now, to find [H3PO4], I can use the first dissociation of H3PO4. The reaction is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-. The Ka1 is 7.5e-3.

So the expression is Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4].

We can rearrange this to find [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1.

But wait, [H2PO4^-] here is the concentration from the solution, but wait, wait. No, because in reality, the H2PO4^- comes from both the initial KH2PO4 and the dissociation of H3PO4. But since H3PO4 is a weak acid and the solution is buffered, the [H2PO4^-] is dominated by the initial value. Let me think about that.

Wait, the initial [H2PO4^-] from KH2PO4 is 0.0367 M, and [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M. The buffer equation tells me that the pH is around 7.09. Then, the H+ concentration would be 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

So, [H+] is around 8.2e-8 M.

Now, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M, but wait, in the buffer solution, some H2PO4^- would come from H3PO4 dissociation. But given that H3PO4's concentration is going to be very low, perhaps the contribution is negligible. So perhaps I can approximate [H2PO4^-] as 0.0367 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The [H2PO4^-] in solution has contributions from both the KH2PO4 and the Na2HPO4. Let me think: when Na2HPO4 dissolves, it gives HPO4^2-, which can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-. So in solution, the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium, and the pH is determined by their ratio.

But for the calculation of [H3PO4], which is the first dissociation, perhaps we can model it as:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

We need to solve for [H3PO4].

But what is [H2PO4^-] in this equation? Because in the solution, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M, but that's only the initial concentration from KH2PO4. However, because HPO4^2- is present, it can react with H+ to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, but actually, the solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are in a fixed ratio determined by the pH. So the [H2PO4^-] is not just the initial 0.0367 M because some of it comes from the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These are buffer components, so the ratio of their concentrations determines the pH. Once I have the pH, I can find the [H+] and use that in the Ka1 expression.

So, using the buffer equation, I found pH ≈7.09, so [H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈8.2e-8 M.

Now, the Ka1 expression is:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

We can rearrange to solve for [H3PO4]:

[H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1

But wait, [H2PO4^-] here isn't just the initial 0.0367 M. Because H3PO4 can donate a proton to form H2PO4^-. But the total [H2PO4^-] in solution is the sum of the initial from KH2PO4 and the amount produced from H3PO4 dissociation, but that might be negligible because H3PO4 is a weak acid and its concentration is low.

Alternatively, perhaps the [H2PO4^-] in the buffer is the concentration that's present, which is 0.0367 M, but that's not accurate because some of it comes from the buffer.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in equilibrium. The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M.

But the buffer equation tells me that [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2). 

I've computed pH as 7.093, pKa2 is 7.207. So 10^(7.093 -7.207) = 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.766. Which matches the ratio 0.02809/0.0367 ≈0.766. So that's correct.

Now, for the H3PO4 concentration. Let me model the system.

The solution has H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- (though the latter is negligible because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so [PO4^3-] would be miniscule).

But in this case, the solution is primarily H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, the first dissociation of H3PO4 produces H2PO4^-.

Let me denote the concentration of H3PO4 as x. So, the dissociation is:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

But [H2PO4^-] is not just x; it's the initial 0.0367 M plus the x from H3PO4 dissociation. Wait, but if x is small, then 0.0367 +x ≈0.0367. So, maybe I can approximate [H2PO4^-] ≈0.0367 M.

So, substituting into the Ka1 expression:

7.5e-3 = (8.2e-8)(0.0367) / x

Wait, no. Because [H+] is 8.2e-8, and [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367.

So, solving for x:

x = (8.2e-8 * 0.0367) / 7.5e-3

Let me compute that.

8.2e-8 * 0.0367 ≈ (8.2 * 3.67e-10) → 30.154e-10 → 3.0154e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.0154e-9 /7.5e-3 = (3.0154 /7.5 )e-6 → 0.402e-6 → 4.02e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 4.02e-7 M, which is near option D) 3.97e-7 M.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Compute numerator: 8.2e-8 * 0.0367.

8.2 *0.0367 is approximately 0.30154. So 0.30154e-8 → 3.0154e-9.

Denominator: 7.5e-3 = 0.0075.

So 3.0154e-9 / 7.5e-3 = (3.0154 / 7.5 ) * 1e-6.

3.0154 /7.5 ≈ 0.402. So 0.402e-6 → 4.02e-7 M.

But wait, the options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So 4.02e-7 is close to D)3.97e-7. Hmm. So perhaps that's the answer. But wait, perhaps I made an error in approximating [H2PO4^-] as 0.0367 M. Because actually, in the buffer, some of the H2PO4^- comes from H3PO4.

Wait, no. Wait the buffer solution is made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The H3PO4 in solution is contributing some H2PO4^-.

Wait, that complicates things. Let me think again.

The total [H2PO4^-] in solution is from two sources: the 0.0367 M from KH2PO4, and the amount from the dissociation of H3PO4. Let me denote [H3PO4] as x. Then, from H3PO4 dissociation, the [H2PO4^-] would be x (assuming x is small compared to 0.0367 M, which I think is the case because x would be on the order of 1e-6 or smaller, much smaller than 0.0367).

So, the actual [H2PO4^-] is (0.0367 + x) ≈0.0367, since x is small.

Wait, but when H3PO4 dissociates, it produces H+ and H2PO4^-.

But in the buffer solution, the pH is fixed, so [H+] is known. So perhaps the presence of H3PO4 doesn't significantly affect the pH, but we can calculate x.

Alternatively, perhaps the [H2PO4^-] in the solution is a combination of the buffer and the H3PO4.

Wait, this might be getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.

The total amount of H2PO4^- in solution comes from two sources: the initial KH2PO4 and the dissociation of H3PO4. But if [H3PO4] is x, then it contributes x to [H2PO4^-].

But the buffer equation already accounts for the [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], so perhaps the [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 plus x, but if x is negligible, it's approximately 0.0367.

But in the buffer, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.766, which is determined by the pH, which is about 7.093.

So, perhaps I should consider that the [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 + x, but given that x is small, it's approximately 0.0367.

So, proceeding with the calculation as before: [H3PO4] = (8.2e-8 * 0.0367) /7.5e-3 ≈4.02e-7 M.

Looking at the options, D is 3.97e-7, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating [H+]. Let me recompute the pH.

Earlier, I used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is p(6.2e-8) = 7.207.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

Ratio is 0.02809/0.0367 = 0.766.

Log(0.766)= approximately -0.114.

So pH=7.207-0.114=7.093.

[H+]=10^(-7.093)=10^(-7) *10^(-0.093) → 1e-7 * 0.828 → 8.28e-8 M.

So [H+] is about 8.28e-8.

So in the Ka1 expression:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

=> [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-]/Ka1.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 M.

So,

[H3PO4] = (8.28e-8 *0.0367) /7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 8.28e-8 *0.0367 ≈ 3.04e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.04e-9 /7.5e-3 = (3.04/7.5) * 1e-6 → approximately 0.405*1e-6 =4.05e-7.

Hmm, that's about 4.05e-7, which is very close to option D (3.97e-7). So probably D is the correct answer. But why is there a slight difference?

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation.

Let me compute [H+] more accurately. pH=7.093 → [H+] = 10^-7.093.

Compute 10^(-0.093) more accurately.

Log(0.828)= -0.087, so 10^(-0.093)= about 0.828 * 10^(-0.006)= 0.828 * 0.9946 → ~0.823.

So [H+]= 8.23e-8.

So,

[H3PO4] = (8.23e-8 * 0.0367) /7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 8.23e-8 *0.0367.

8.23 *0.0367 ≈0.302.

So 0.302e-8 =3.02e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.02e-9 /7.5e-3 = (3.02/7.5) *1e-6.

3.02 /7.5 ≈0.4027.

So 0.4027e-6 =4.027e-7 M.

Which is approximately 4.03e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is D)3.97e-7.

Hmm, why is there a discrepancy? Let me check my initial calculation of the moles again.

Wait, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles =1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈0.0056179 mol.

That's correct.

And KH2PO4 is 1.00g /136.09 g/mol= approx 0.00734 mol. Correct.

So their concentrations are 0.0367 M and 0.02809 M, respectively.

Calculating the pH again:

pKa2=7.207.

ratio=0.02809/0.0367=0.766.

log(0.766)= -0.114.

pH=7.207 -0.114=7.093.

So [H+]=1e-7.093=approx 8.23e-8.

So calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of the log(0.766) would give a more accurate pH.

Let me compute log(0.766) more precisely.

Log(0.766)= log(7.66e-1).

Using logarithm tables or a calculator.

We know that log(7.66)=0.8847 (since 10^0.8847≈7.66).

So log(0.766)=0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.

So pH=7.207 -0.1153=7.0917.

[H+]= 10^-7.0917 ≈ 8.20e-8.

Let me compute 8.20e-8 * 0.0367.

8.20e-8 *0.0367 = 0.0367 *8.2e-8.

0.0367 *8.2=0.30154.

So 0.30154e-8=3.0154e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3 (7.5e-3=0.0075).

3.0154e-9 /0.0075= (3.0154 /7.5 ) *1e-6.

3.0154 divided by 7.5 is approximately 0.40205.

So 0.40205e-6 is 4.0205e-7 M.

Which is 4.02e-7, but the option D is 3.97e-7. So why the slight difference?

Ah, perhaps because I made an approximation in the [H2PO4^-]?

Wait, perhaps in the buffer, the [H2PO4^-] isn't just from KH2PO4, but also includes the contribution from H3PO4.

Let me model it more accurately.

Let me denote:

Total H2PO4^- in solution = from KH2PO4 + from H3PO4 dissociation.

But in the buffer, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367 + x, where x is the [H3PO4] dissociated.

Wait, but in the buffer, the [H2PO4^-] is determined by the buffer equation. Wait, no. The buffer equation is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But if [H3PO4] is x, then [H2PO4^-] would be 0.0367 +x, and [HPO4^2-] would be 0.02809 + y (where y is the amount of HPO4^2- formed from H2PO4^- accepting a proton.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of H3PO4 is negligible compared to the buffer components, so the buffer equation holds as before, and the [H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.0367.

So that the [H3PO4] is 4.02e-7 M, which would be option D.

So why is option D 3.97e-7? Maybe a more precise calculation.

Let me recompute the [H+] accurately.

pH=7.0917.

[H+]=10^(-7.0917).

Compute 10^-7.0917= 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0917)= 1e-7 * (10^(-0.0917)).

Compute 10^(-0.0917):

We know that log(0.818)= -0.088, since 10^(-0.088)= ~0.818.

But 0.0917 is a bit more.

Using natural logarithm approximation:

ln(10^x) =x ln(10).

Wait, perhaps better to compute 10^(-0.0917)=?

We can write it as e^(-0.0917 * ln10).

ln(10)=2.302585.

So exponent: -0.0917 *2.302585≈-0.211.

e^-0.211≈0.809.

So [H+]≈8.09e-8.

So [H3PO4] = (8.09e-8 *0.0367 ) /7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 8.09e-8 *0.0367 = 8.09 *0.0367 *1e-8.

8.09 *0.0367 ≈ 0.296.

So 0.296e-8=2.96e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 2.96e-9 /7.5e-3 = (2.96/7.5)*1e-6.

2.96/7.5≈ 0.3947.

So 0.3947e-6 =3.947e-7 M.

Which is approximately 3.95e-7, which is very close to option D:3.97e-7.

Ah, I see. So with a more accurate [H+], the [H3PO4] is about 3.95e-7, which aligns well with option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} \right)
\]
- pKa₂:  
  \[
  \text{pKa}_2 = \log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
  \]
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = \frac{0.02809}{0.0367} \approx 0.766
  \]
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate [H₃PO₄] using the Ka₁ expression
The first dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{H₃PO₄} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{H₂PO₄}^-
\]
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a₁ = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}{[\text{H₃PO₄}]}
\]
Rearranging for [H₃PO₄]:  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}{K_a₁}
\]
- [H⁺]:  
  \[
  [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
  \]
- [H₂PO₄⁻]:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = 0.0367 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{(8.23 \times 10^{-8})(0.0367)}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx \frac{3.04 \times 10^{-9}}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 4.05 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of H₃PO₄ is approximately \( 4.05 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option D (\( 3.97 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
