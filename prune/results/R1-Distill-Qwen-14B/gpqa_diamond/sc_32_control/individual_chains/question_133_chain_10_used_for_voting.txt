Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with buffer solutions and all that, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. They give me the molecular weights: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³-.

The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12. Right, so these are the dissociation constants for each step of the phosphoric acid.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are used to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is probably going to come into play here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but wait, let's think about the salts here. KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H₂PO₄⁻. Similarly, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO₄²⁻, plus the water molecules. So the solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions.

I remember that the H₂PO₄⁻ can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO₄²⁻) and HPO₄²⁻ can act as a base (accepting a proton to become H₂PO₄⁻). So this system is a buffer, with H₂PO₄⁻ as the acid and HPO₄²⁻ as the conjugate base.

The relevant Ka here is Ka2 because H₂PO₄⁻ losing a proton gives HPO₄²⁻. So Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8. Therefore, the pKa would be the negative log of Ka2. Let me calculate that. The log of 6.2e-8 is log(6.2) is about 0.79, so pKa2 is 7.21? Because 10^-7.21 is around 6.2e-8. Wait, wait, actually, the pKa is the negative log of the Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8
Log(6.2) is about 0.792. So the log of 6.2e-8 is 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So the pKa2 is 7.208. Okay, that's manageable.

Now, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, wait, in this case, the acid is H₂PO₄⁻ (since it donates a proton to become HPO₄²⁻), so the base is HPO₄²⁻. So the equation becomes pH = pKa2 + log([HPO₄²⁻]/[H₂PO₄⁻]).

But wait, the question is not asking for pH. It's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO₄³-? Because orthophosphate is PO₄³⁻. But wait, wait, in this buffer system, the PO₄³- concentration is going to be very low because the third dissociation is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So that's a very weak acid, so HPO₄²⁻ doesn't dissociate much into PO₄³- and H+.

Wait, but wait. The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, i.e., [PO₄³⁻]. How can I find that?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the various equilibria here. The main species are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The PO₄³- is formed by the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻.

The reaction is HPO₄²⁻ ↔ PO₄³⁻ + H+.

The Ka for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is going to be determined by this third dissociation. But in the buffer solution, the H+ concentration is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.

So, perhaps I can find [H+] first using the buffer equation, then use that to find [PO₄³⁻].

But wait, let's think about the steps.

1. Calculate the moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

2. Since the solution volume is 200 mL, calculate the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.

3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

4. Then, knowing the pH (which is [H+]), use it in the expression for Ka3 to find [PO₄³⁻].

Alternatively, maybe I can directly calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka3 and the [H+] from the buffer.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let's compute that.

136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.1 g/mol. So 1g / 136.1 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: mass is 1.00 g. Mw is 177.99 g/mol, so 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

But wait, each mole of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O gives one mole of HPO₄²⁻, because the formula is Na2HPO4.2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. So each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, each mole of KH₂PO₄ gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

So the concentrations in the solution are:

[H₂PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M.

Wait, wait, but wait, 1/136.09 is about 0.007345 mol. Divided by 0.2 L, which is 200 mL, that's 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M for H2PO4^-.

Similarly, 1g / 177.99 g/mol is approximately 0.005607 mol. Divided by 0.2 L, 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M for HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

1.00 g of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 /136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Same for the other: 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005607 mol.

Yes.

So the concentrations of H2PO4^- is 0.036725 M, and HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer. The relevant pKa is pKa2, which is 7.208.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]) = 7.208 + log(0.028035 / 0.036725).

Compute the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈ -0.116.

Wait, because log(0.764) is negative. Let me calculate that accurately.

log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) ≈ 0.764 is between 10^-0.1 (≈ 0.794) and 10^-0.2 (≈ 0.631). Wait, 10^-0.11 is about 0.776? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, I can use the approximation method. Let's calculate log(0.764).

We know that log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.75) is about -0.1249, log(0.76) is approximately -0.1179, and log(0.764) is a bit higher, maybe around -0.115.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

But maybe I should just compute it more accurately. Let's see:

We can use the fact that log(7.64) is approximately 0.884. Then, since 0.764 = 7.64 * 10^-1, so log(0.764)= log(7.64) + (-1) ≈ 0.884 - 1 = -0.116.

So the pH would be 7.208 + (-0.116) = 7.092.

So pH is approximately 7.092.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the [H+] concentration. pH = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-7.092 is about 8.21e-8. Let me compute that.

Yes, because 10^0.092 is approximately 1.23 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.258, so 0.092 is a bit less, like 1.23). So 10^-7.092 is 1e-7 / 1.23 ≈ 8.13e-8 M. Close enough for now.

Now, we can consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M, and [H+] is 8.21e-8 M.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.21e-8).

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.0463e-14.

Then, denominator is 8.21e-8.

So 5.0463e-14 / 8.21e-8 = ?

Let me calculate that:

5.0463e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0463 /8.21) * 1e-6.

5.0463 /8.21 is approximately 0.6145.

So 0.6145e-6 = 6.145e-7 M.

Wait, that gives me around 6.145e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, option B is 5.48e-7, option C is 2.81e-7, and option D is 3.97e-7.

Hmm, the calculation I did gives roughly 6.145e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but maybe I made an approximation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Let me recalculate log(0.764) more accurately.

Using a calculator: log(0.764) = ?

I can compute it as follows. Using the Taylor expansion or a logarithm table.

Alternatively, I can use natural logarithm and then convert.

Wait, perhaps the pH calculation was slightly off, which would affect the [H+] and thus the [PO4^3-].

Let me recompute the ratio and the log.

The ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028035 / 0.036725.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.028035 / 0.036725 = approximately 0.764.

Let me compute 28035 / 36725: 28035 ÷ 36725.

Well, 36725 x 0.7 = 25707.5.

36725 x 0.76 = 27871.

So 0.76 gives 27871. Then, 28035-27871=164.

So 164 /36725 ≈ 0.00447.

So the ratio is approximately 0.76447.

So log(0.76447) = ?

Using a calculator approach, I can use the log approximation.

Log(7.6447 × 10^-1) = log(7.6447) + log(10^-1) = 0.8842 -1 = -0.1158.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's precise enough.

Alternatively, using the formula:

Log(x) ≈ (ln x) / ln(10).

ln(0.76447) ≈ ln(0.76) is about -0.270, but precise value.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator:

ln(0.76447) ≈ -0.2684.

Divide by ln(10)=2.3026.

So log(0.76447) ≈ (-0.2684)/(2.3026) ≈ -0.1165.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.1165) = 7.0915.

So pH is approximately 7.0915, which gives [H+] = 10^-7.0915 ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7, so 10^-7.0915 is 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0915).

10^(-0.0915) ≈ 0.813.

So [H+] is 8.13e-8 M.

Now, back to [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.13e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.13e-8: 5.0463e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.0463/8.13) e-6.

5.0463 /8.13 is approximately 0.6206.

So 0.6206e-6 = 6.206e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.206e-7 M, matching option A (6.24e-7) closely.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g/177.99 g/mol = approximately 0.005607 mol.

Yes.

Concentration is moles / volume in liters. So 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M for H2PO4^-.

0.005607 /0.2 = 0.028035 M for HPO4^2-.

So that part seems correct.

Then the Henderson equation leads to pH ≈7.0915, [H+]≈8.13e-8.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.13e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.13e-8: (5.0463e-14) / (8.13e-8) = 6.207e-7.

Which is about 6.207e-7, which would round to 6.21e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Hmm, so perhaps the exact calculation would get a bit closer.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise [H+] value.

Let me compute [H+] more accurately. pH is 7.0915, so [H+] =10^(-7.0915).

Compute 10^(-7.0915) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0915).

10^(-7) = 1e-7.

10^(-0.0915) = e^(-0.0915 * ln10) = e^(-0.0915 * 2.302585) = e^(-0.2107) ≈ 0.810.

So [H+] ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.10e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.10e-8: (5.0463e-14)/(8.10e-8) = (5.0463 /8.10) *1e-6.

5.0463 ÷8.10 ≈ 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 = 6.23e-7 M.

Which is 6.23e-7, almost exactly matching option A (6.24e-7).

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, I just realized something. The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

But wait, in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and a tiny amount of PO4^3-.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the [PO4^3-] is 6.24e-7 M, which is option A. So that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka1 = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka2 = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka3 = 1.8×10⁻¹². The relevant equilibrium involves HPO₄²⁻ dissociating into PO₄³⁻ and H⁺, governed by Ka3.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L. Thus:
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007345 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\),
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005607 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right).
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.028035}{0.036725}\right).
\]
The ratio \(\frac{0.028035}{0.036725} \approx 0.764\), and \(\log(0.764) \approx -0.116\). Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [H⁺] from pH
\[
[H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Use Ka3 to find [PO₄³⁻]
The dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]
The equilibrium expression is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035) \approx 5.0463 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then divide by \(8.13 \times 10^{-8}\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0463 \times 10^{-14}}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.206 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \(6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option A.
