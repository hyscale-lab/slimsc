Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The problem involves a bosonic field X interacting with fermions, and we're given the Lagrangian for that interaction. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find out which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into kinematically.

First, I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion and antifermion must have at least some rest mass, the boson's mass must be enough to create both. So, the condition is M_X >= 2 * m_fermion.

I need to consider all possible fermions that X could decay into. The options provided include different quarks and leptons. Let's list out the possible fermions and their masses.

Quarks come in different flavors: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), and top (t). But wait, the top quark is super heavy, around 173 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks. So any option mentioning t tbar is out. Looking at the options, option C includes t tbar, so that's not possible. So probably C is incorrect.

Next, let's think about the masses of other quarks. The up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks. The up quark is about 2 MeV, down is around 4-5 MeV, strange is about 100 MeV, charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV. So for X (6 GeV), the maximum fermion mass it can pair would be when 2m_f <=6 GeV. So m_f <= 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, actually, each fermion pair requires that the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to the boson's mass. So for each pair, 2m_f <= M_X. So any fermion with m_f <=3 GeV can be produced.

So let's check each quark:

u quark: ~2 MeV, way below. So u ubar is allowed.
d quark: around 4 MeV, allowed.
s quark: around 100 MeV, allowed.
c quark: ~1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV, so 6 GeV is more than that. So c cbar allowed.
b quark: ~4.5 GeV. 2*4.5=9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9. So b and anti-b cannot be produced because 6 < 9. So X cannot decay into b bbar. So any option with b bbar is incorrect.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up. The decay is X → ff̄. So 2m_f must be <= M_X. For the b quark, 2*4.5=9 GeV. X is 6 GeV. So 6 <9 → can't decay into b bbar. So any option that includes b bbar is wrong.

Looking at the options, option A includes b bbar, so A is incorrect. Option D includes b bbar, so D is also incorrect. Wait, but wait, what about the others?

Looking at the quark masses again: 

u: 2 MeV → 2m=4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
d: 4 MeV → 8 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
s: 100 MeV → 200 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
c: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.
b: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 → not allowed.
t: way too heavy.

So the quarks allowed are u, d, s, c. So any decay into these quarks and their antiquarks is allowed.

Now for leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their antiparticles. The masses are:

electron: ~0.5 MeV → allowed (2m_e ~1 MeV <<6 GeV).
muon: ~105 MeV → allowed.
tau: ~1.78 GeV → 2m_tau ~3.56 GeV. 6 GeV is bigger than that, so allowed.

So X can decay into e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

So putting it all together: allowed fermion pairs are u, d, s, c quarks, and e, mu, tau leptons.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. But since b is not allowed, A is wrong.

Option B: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, wait, option B in the question says: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Oh yes, that's correct. Because the mass is 6 GeV, which is above 2m_c (3 GeV), so c is allowed. Also, 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, so allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? It's not in any of the options except C, but C includes t, which is not possible because X is only 6 GeV. So option C is out.

Option D: Includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option must be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we use the condition that the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it decays into: \( M_X \geq 2m_f \). This ensures that the fermion and antifermion pair can be created.

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
- **Quarks**:
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \sim 8 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \sim 200 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed** (6 GeV < 9 GeV).
  - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed** (6 GeV < 346 GeV).

- **Leptons**:
  - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
  - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \sim 210 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
  - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (6 GeV < 9 GeV). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which satisfy \( M_X \geq 2m_f \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed (6 GeV < 346 GeV). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (6 GeV < 9 GeV). **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), corresponding to **Option B**.
