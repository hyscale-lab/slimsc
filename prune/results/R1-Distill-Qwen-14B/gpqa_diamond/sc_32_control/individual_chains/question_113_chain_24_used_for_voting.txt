Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound and used three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given data among the options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down the information from each technique one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, or maybe something like an ether. Wait, no, ethers don't have O-H. So if it's a broad peak, it's probably either an alcohol (OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Also, the question mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 

Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak. I'm thinking that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 cm^-1 is another peak, which is a bit lower than 1700. That could maybe be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester. Wait, another thought: if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, the carbonyl peak might be around 1680-1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester's carbonyl is around 1740, but sometimes they can be lower. Or a ketone is around 1700. 

Wait, the FTIR shows two peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that's two different types of carbonyl groups? Or maybe one group with two different absorptions. No, I think it's two separate carbonyls. But wait, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe one of them isn't a carbonyl. Let me think. Another peak at 1650 could be conjugated with something else. Like maybe a C=C. Also, C=C stretching is around 1600-1680 cm^-1. So 1650 could be a C=C in conjugation with something else, like a carbonyl.

So putting that together, perhaps there's a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and an conjugated C=C. So maybe something like an aromatic ester or a cyclic ketone with a double bond nearby.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a C=C, like in a double bond. So that suggests the compound has at least one double bond. So maybe an alkene is present.

Then, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45. I need to think about what fragments would give that. 45 is a common fragment. Let's see: the molecular ion could break into smaller ions. For example, if the compound is something like an ester, maybe the ester group could cleave. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is trimethyl ether? No, wait, trimethyl ether's molecular weight is 58. Or maybe a CH2O group? Wait, 45 is 15 (CH3) plus 30? Maybe not. Wait, 45 could be a fragment from the molecule, like CH2O something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the fragment from a benzene ring. Like if the molecule is a benzene derivative, the benzene ring might lose a substituent, leaving a smaller fragment. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to C3H7O, but that might not be a common fragment.

Wait, another approach: possible molecular formulas given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Let me list their molecular weights and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O is (6*12)+(10*1)+16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

Mass spectrum's m/z=45. So considering that, perhaps the molecular ion is breaking into a fragment of 45. Let's think about the possible fragments.

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2 (Option A), what could break off? Maybe an ester group. Let's say if it's an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then maybe the ester could break into an alkyl group and the acylium ion. Alternatively, for example, if there's an ethyl group attached, the ethyl (29) plus something else? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. For example, CH3COO has a molecular weight of 60, but that's not 45. Wait, if it's a propenoate ion or something else.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. Or maybe an acetyl group. Acetone (CH3COCH3) has a molecular weight of 58. Not 45.

Alternative approach: Let's think of possible functional groups. The FTIR has O-H (broad) and two carbonyl peaks. Wait, no, the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond.

Wait, 1700 could be a carbonyl (like ester or ketone), and 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but I thought aromatic C=C are around 1450-1600. Alternatively, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. For example, an enone system. So the 1700 would be the carbonyl (maybe ketone), and 1650 would be the conjugated C=C.

In that case, the structure would have a conjugated double bond adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone. So maybe something like cyclohexenone or a substituted ketone with a conjugated double bond.

Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests that the double bond is not part of an aromatic ring but is a simple alkene. Because in aromatic rings, the protons are typically more deshielded and appear in a different region, but the question says "vinyl hydrogens," which are the ones on a double bond, not necessarily aromatic. So maybe it's a simple conjugated diene or a single vinyl group adjacent to a carbonyl.

So putting that together, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with a conjugated double bond, like cyclopentenone or something similar. But let's think about the molecular formulas.

Let me look at the options again:

A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU). For C6H12O2.

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X and N are zero.

So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1.

Wait, that would be a DoU of 1. But I thought we have a double bond (from the NMR) plus a carbonyl (from IR), which would be two degrees of unsaturation. Hmm, so that can't be. Because each DoU is either a ring or a double bond.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

DoU formula: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N ) /2.

For option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So that's one DoU. But if the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl (two DoU), then option A can't be right because its DoU is only 1. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each option's DoU.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree: maybe one ring or one double bond.

But from the data, we have both a double bond (vinyl H's) and a carbonyl (two peaks?), which would require two DoU. So perhaps the compound has two DoU.

Wait, but maybe the two peaks in IR are from the same group. Like an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, but for an aromatic ring, that's a ring (three DoU), plus a carbonyl (another DoU). Wait, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe one peak is C=C (DoU +1) and another is carbonyl (DoU +1). So that would be two DoU in total.

So which options have a DoU of 2?

Let me calculate for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. Not enough.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So DoU=2. That fits! Because we have a double bond (DoU=1) and a carbonyl group (DoU=1), total 2.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So also 2 DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=2/2=1. So DoU=1, again not enough.

So options B and C have DoU of 2.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. That O is either in an alcohol (O in O-H) or another oxygen-containing group, like in a carbonyl, but if it's a carbonyl, then the O is in the carbonyl, not in an -OH.

Wait, no, the O in the O-H is separate. So if the compound has an -OH group, then that's an additional O.

Looking at the options, which have O in the formula?

All options except perhaps... wait, no, all options have O except none. Wait, all options have O in their formula.

Wait, looking again:

Options:

A) C6H12O2: two O's.

B) C6H10O: one O.

C) C6H10O2: two O's.

D) C6H12O: one O.

So from the IR, the -OH group implies that we have an O in the structure. So all options have O. So perhaps the O is part of an -OH group. So the formula can have either one O (like alcohol) or two O's (like ester, which has -O-C-O-).

Wait, but if the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, that suggests two carbonyl groups? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and another group, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be another carbonyl in a conjugated system or a C=C.

Wait, but if there's a conjugated C=C, maybe that's part of an ester group. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. In that case, the ester carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated C=C is around 1650. So the FTIR would have two peaks: 1700 for the carbonyl and 1650 for the C=C in conjugation.

In that case, the compound would have an ester group and a double bond. So the O in the ester is part of two O's. So the formula would have two O's.

Looking at the options, options A and C have two O's.

But earlier, looking at DoU, options B and C have DoU=2. So option C (C6H10O2) has DoU=2 and two O's.

Alternatively, option A (C6H12O2) has DoU=1, which would need another DoU. So that's a problem.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the presence of a double bond. So that's one DoU.

The FTIR has a carbonyl group (two DoU, if one is a carbonyl and another is a double bond). Wait, no, the carbonyl is a DoU, and the double bond is another DoU. So two DoU in total.

So the compound must have two DoU. So, which options have DoU=2?

Options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2). Both have DoU=2.

Now, considering the O's. If the compound has an -OH group (from the broad peak in IR), then the O could be in an alcohol. So, if the formula is C6H10O, that would be one O. So the structure would have an -OH, a carbonyl (like a ketone), and a double bond.

Wait, but a ketone is a carbonyl, which is one DoU, the double bond is another. Plus the -OH as an O.

But wait, if the formula is C6H10O, then the DoU is 2, which matches the two DoU needed.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, with two O's, perhaps the structure includes an ester group (which has two O's) and a double bond. But an ester would also have a carbonyl. So that might fit the IR peaks.

So let's think about the possible structures for each.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular formula suggests a compound with one O. If it's an alcohol with a ketone? But that would require two O's. Wait, no, because the ketone is a C=O, which uses an O. So if the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would be something like C6H10O2 (since ketone has one O, alcohol has another O). But option B has only one O. So that can't be. So maybe the O is part of another group, like an ether. But ether doesn't have an O-H. Hmm, but the IR has a broad peak indicating O-H. So that suggests an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have O in the -COOH group. Let's see: the formula C6H10O would have molecular formula with one O. But a carboxylic acid has two O's: -COOH has two O's. So that would require the formula to have two O's. So option B (C6H10O) can't be a carboxylic acid.

So perhaps option B isn't the correct one because it has only one O, but the IR suggests O-H and two carbonyls (but maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks at 1700 and 1650 aren't both carbonyls. Let me think again. 1700 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. 1650 could be an aromatic ring (but I'm not sure). Wait, aromatic C=C are usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, for example, that would have a carbonyl (ester) at around 1700, and the conjugated C=C at around 1650.

In that case, the formula would have two O's (from the ester group), so the formula would be either A or C.

But esters have the formula R-O-CO-R', so the molecular formula would have two O's.

Wait, what about the mass spectrum? The fragment at m/z=45.

If the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group could break into a fragment. Let's think about possible fragments.

Ester cleavage: For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the ester could cleave into R-O-CO+ and R' as a fragment. The R' could be a small group, like methyl. So if R' is methyl, the fragment would be CH3. But that would be m/z=15, which isn't 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger group, and when the molecule breaks apart, a fragment with more atoms is formed.

45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see what possible structures would add up to that. Maybe (CH3)2CHO- would contribute to that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2C=O with a positive charge?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2. For example, it could be an ester with a double bond. Or a diester? Or a cyclic ester.

Another possibility is that the compound is an aromatic ester, but since it's vinyl hydrogens, it's not an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps a substituted ester with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that would have an ester group and a ring. But in that case, the DoU would be two (ring and ester's carbonyl). So for C6H10O2, DoU is (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So that fits.

But then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700, and perhaps a conjugated double bond at 1650. So that fits.

The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond somewhere.

The mass spectrum's m/z=45: let's think about what could come from a C6H10O2 molecule.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114.

So if the molecular ion breaks into a fragment, perhaps the major fragment is CH2O2, but that's 44. Hmm, close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2O plus something else. Or perhaps a group like CH3COO (which is 60, but that's higher than 45).

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses part of itself. For example, losing a propyl group (C3H7, which is 43) would leave a fragment of 114-43=71. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a smaller part. Let's think: maybe the molecule breaks into a part with 3 carbons. So 3 carbons could be, for example, a ketone group or a fragment with a carbonyl.

Wait, 45 could be a ketene ion. A ketene is O=C=O, which has a molecular weight of 44 (O=16, C=12, another O=16, but wait, that's O=C=O. So 12 + 16 + 16 =44). Wait, but that's 44, not 45. Or perhaps a methyl ketene, which would be CH3C=O, which is 58g/mol. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is C3H7O. Let's calculate that: 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=60. No, that's 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, could it be a propyl group with an O? Like CH2CH2CHO? No, that's more than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2O group (30 g/mol) plus something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of m/z=45 as (CH3)2CHO or something similar. Let me calculate: (CH3)2CHO would be C3H7O, which is 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=60, still not 45.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the 45 is a small ion, like C3H7+ or something else. Wait, C3H7+ is 45? Let's calculate: 3*12 +7=36+7=43. No, not 45. Alternatively, C2H5O+? 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! Wait, 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one oxygen. So 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. So m/z=45 could be a fragment like CH2CH2O+? Or maybe OCH2CH2+. Hmm, but that's only 45.

So, if the molecule has a fragment that is OCH2CH2 (which is 45), then the parent ion would lose that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). The molecular weight of that group is 45 (16 + 2*12 +3*1 =16+24+3=43). Wait, no, 16 + (2*12) is 30, plus 3 is 33. Wait, 16 (O) + 2*12 (for two carbons) + 2*1 (for two H in OCH2CH3) but wait, OCH2CH3 has formula OCH2CH3, which is O, C2H7? Wait, OCH2CH3 is O, C2H7? No, wait, CH2CH3O- would be OCH2CH3. Its molecular weight is 16 + (2*12) + (7*1) =16 +24 +7=47. Hmm, which is a bit higher than 45. So not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3CO+. That's C2H3O+. Molecular weight: 24 +3 +16=43. Not 45.

Wait, another approach. The possible molecular formulas are either C6H10O2 or C6H10O, as the others don't fit the DoU.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. So if the formula is C6H10O2, the possible structure might be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about possible structures that would give a fragment at m/z=45.

Suppose the molecule is methyl vinyl ketone (but that's C4H6O), not matching. Or maybe something bigger.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the possible structures for each option.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So, two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, it's a double bond. So the other DoU comes from a ring or another double bond.

So structure could be a cyclopentene with a ketone or an alcohol. For example, cyclopentenol. So cyclopentenol would have a five-membered ring (DoU=1) and a double bond (DoU=1). So that fits the DoU=2.

But does that fit the IR?

The FTIR would show a broad O-H stretch (from the alcohol), a carbonyl stretch (if there's a ketone), but in cyclopentenol, it's an alcohol, not a ketone. So the IR would have O-H and perhaps a conjugated double bond.

Wait, cyclopentenol has an -OH group and a conjugated double bond. So the IR would show O-H (broad) and the C=C in conjugation. So the 1700 peak wouldn't be present because there's no carbonyl group. So that doesn't fit the IR data which has a strong peak at 1700.

So option B might not fit because the 1700 peak would require a carbonyl group, which would need another O. So if the compound has an O-H (so one O), a double bond (another DoU), and a carbonyl (third DoU?), but then that would require a higher DoU than provided by the formula.

Wait, but the DoU for option B is 2. So that can't have a carbonyl (which would add another DoU). So option B must not have a carbonyl group. So the 1700 peak wouldn't be explained by option B. Thus, option B is probably incorrect.

So moving on to option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Assuming the structure has a carbonyl group (DoU=1) and a double bond (DoU=1), which would fit.

The IR shows O-H (broad), so that's one O. The carbonyl is another O, making a total of two O's, which matches the formula.

So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the ester group has a carbonyl, and the conjugated double bond would be around 1650 cm^-1.

So for the mass spectrum, the fragment at 45 could be from the ester part. Let's think: the ester group is O-CO-O-R (but no, it's O-CO-O-R, but in esters, it's R-O-CO-R'. When the ester breaks, perhaps it loses a part.

Wait, another approach: what is the molecular weight of the possible fragment.

If the fragment is 45, for option C (C6H10O2, MW 114), the possible fragments could be 45 and 69 (114-45=69). Alternatively, other combinations.

But how would the ester break? Let's imagine the ester group is part of the structure. If the ester breaks, the carbonyl could form a fragment.

Wait, for example, if the structure is something like CH2CH2COO-R, then upon fragmentation, the COO-R could cleave, but that would give a larger fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have the structure where the ester is part of the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the molecular formula C6H10O2. Maybe it's an aromatic ester, but earlier I thought the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic. So perhaps it's not aromatic.

Wait, another thought: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are H's on a double bond. So the structure has a C=C somewhere.

So, combining all this, the structure is likely an ester with a conjugated double bond, i.e., an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700 cm^-1, and the conjugated C=C at ~1650 cm^-1. The O-H (from the ester's alcohol part?) Wait, no, esters are formed from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. So if the ester is present, it doesn't have an O-H. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So if it's an ester, where is the O-H coming from?

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol ester? Or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But earlier I thought a carboxylic acid would require two O's, which would fit option C.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH. So the molecular formula would be RCOOH, which would have two O's in the COOH group. So for C6H10O2, the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid or something similar.

Wait, if the structure is an acrylic acid derivative, like CH2=CHCOOH. But the formula for that is C3H4O2. But our compound is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, not aromatic.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diacid or a monoacid with a double bond.

Alternatively, think of the structure as having both an ester group and a hydroxyl group. Then the formula would have two O's. But that might complicate things.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize the data:

FTIR:
- Broad peak ~3000 cm^-1: O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- 1700 cm^-1: carbonyl group (ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc.)
- 1650 cm^-1: possibly conjugated C=C or another carbonyl.

1H NMR:
- Peaks for vinyl H's: presence of a double bond.

Mass Spec:
- Fragment peak at m/z=45.

Possible options with two DoU and two O's: Option C (C6H10O2).

So the structure likely includes a carbonyl group (from 1700), a double bond (from NMR and 1650 IR), and an O-H group (from 3000 IR). Wait, but that would require three O's: O from O-H, O from carbonyl, and another O? Or perhaps the O from the carbonyl is part of an ester, which has two O's. So maybe the structure is a diol ester or something else.

Wait, but for C6H10O2, if it's a diol ester, that would have two O's from the ester group and a hydroxyl group, making three O's. But the molecular formula only has two O's, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ketone and there's an ester. But that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is an aldehyde, but that's less likely.

Another angle: the O-H in IR could come from a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the structure as a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require more O's.

Wait, maybe it's a hydroxy ketone, like a dihydroxy ketone. But that would have more than two O's.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about the mass spec again.

If the fragment is m/z=45, which is 45 g/mol, what structures could produce that?

45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (which is C3H7O), but that's 3(12) +7(1) +16(1)=36+7+16=60. No.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of (CH2O) plus something else. CH2O is formaldehyde, 30. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is C2H5O2^+? No, that's 2*12 +5 + 32=24+5+32=61.

Wait, maybe it's something like (CH2CH2O)+. Let's calculate: 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! Wait, CH2CH2O is not a correct formula. It should be CH2CH2O, but that's two carbons, five hydrogens, and one oxygen. So the formula is C2H5O.

Wait, but the molecular formula of the parent compound is C6H10O2 (option C). So if the parent breaks into a C2H5O fragment (45), then the remaining would be C4H5O.

Wait, C4H5O has a molecular weight of 4*12 +5 +16= 48 +5 +16=69. So that's possible.

So, the parent molecule (C6H10O2, 114) breaks into C2H5O (45) and C4H5O (69). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a common fragmentation pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a propenyl group. For example, a propenyl cation (C3H5+) would have a molecular weight of 3*12 +5=41. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a butenyl ion. But that's getting complicated.

Another thought: Perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have an ester group and a ring. So for example, a six-membered ring lactone with a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of the structure as an orthoester, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol group. But that would require more O's.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer must be among them. Let's see which options' molecular weights are compatible with a fragment of 45.

If the molecular weight is 114 (option C), the fragment 45 is possible if the molecule breaks into two parts. 45 is less than half of 114, so it's plausible.

Option A has a molecular weight of 116, so 45 is possible.

But let's think about the possible structures for these options.

Option C: C6H10O2. It's either an ester with a double bond, a ketone with an ester, or something else.

Option A: C6H12O2. It's an ester without a double bond (since no vinyl H's), but the NMR has vinyl H's. So option A can't be right because the NMR shows a double bond, which would require a DoU of 1, but option A has DoU=1, which would mean only one ring or one double bond. Wait, the NMR has vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have a double bond, which would use up one DoU. The other DoU would come from a carbonyl (the 1700 peak). So the structure must have two DoU, which options B and C have.

Wait, no. Option A has DoU=1: that would mean only a double bond or a ring. But the structure must have a double bond (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), which are two DoU. So option A can't be correct because it only has one DoU.

So, only options B and C are left, but option B's formula can't explain the 1700 peak because it only has one O. So that leaves option C as the only possibility.

So, conclusion: the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an **O-H group** (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- Strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a **carbonyl group** (C=O) and possibly a **conjugated C=C bond**.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a **double bond**.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The possible formulas are:
- **C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1 (not enough for the observed data, as two DoU are required).
- **C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2 (fits the data, but only one oxygen is present, which cannot account for both the O-H and carbonyl groups).
- **C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2 (fits the data, with two oxygens to account for both the O-H and carbonyl groups).
- **C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1 (not enough for the observed data).

### Key Observations:
1. The **broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates an O-H group, requiring at least one oxygen.
2. The **peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹** suggest a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, requiring two DoU.
3. The **vinyl hydrogens in the NMR** confirm the presence of a double bond.
4. The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is consistent with a smaller fragment, such as **C₂H₅O**.

### Elimination of Options:
- **C₆H₁₂O₂** is eliminated because it has only one DoU, insufficient for the observed data.
- **C₆H₁₀O** is eliminated because it has only one oxygen, which cannot account for both the O-H and carbonyl groups.
- **C₆H₁₂O** is eliminated for the same reason as C₆H₁₂O₂.
- **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only formula that satisfies all the data:
  - It has two oxygens, fitting the O-H and carbonyl groups.
  - It has two DoU, matching the double bond and carbonyl group.
  - The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is consistent with a smaller fragment from this formula.

### Conclusion:
The unknown compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
