Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So in this case, A is Pz. So I'll need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So I can't directly say that the state is an eigenstate of Pz. Therefore, the expectation values won't be straightforward. I'll have to calculate them using the given state.

First, let's write down the given state as a column vector. The state |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Wait, actually, let me confirm. The first component is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2. So the vector is:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ. Similarly, ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ.

But wait, Pz is the operator whose matrix is given. Let me write down the matrix for Pz.

Pz matrix is:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, the matrix is diagonal. That makes sense since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the respective basis vectors.

So, the basis states are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩, corresponding to the rows.

Wait, but the given state is in the Pz basis because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the components of the state vector correspond to the amplitudes in the |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩ basis.

So our state ψ is written in the Pz basis.

But wait, the problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of Px. So, the state ψ is expressed in the Pz basis, which is the computational basis here.

So, let's compute ⟨Pz⟩. That's the expectation value of Pz in state ψ.

⟨Pz⟩ = ψ† Pz ψ

Given that Pz is diagonal, the calculation is straightforward.

But let me compute it step by step.

Each component of ψ is:
ψ₁ = -1/2
ψ₂ = 1/√2
ψ₃ = -1/2

So, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. Since all the components are real, ψ† is just the transpose.

So, ψ† Pz ψ would be sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* (Pz)_ij ψ_j.

But since Pz is diagonal, the only non-zero terms are when i = j.

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = (ψ₁^2 * Pz11) + (ψ₂^2 * Pz22) + (ψ₃^2 * Pz33)

Wait, no. Wait, actually, since Pz is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 times the eigenvalue for each basis state.

Because each basis state |i⟩ has eigenvalue (Pz)_ii.

So, |+z⟩ has eigenvalue ħ, |0z⟩ has 0, and |-z⟩ has eigenvalue -ħ.

So, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is:

|ψ₁|² * ħ + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ)

Let me compute each term.

|ψ₁|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So:

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ)
= (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ)
= 0

Oh, that's interesting. The expectation value of Pz is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩.

Since Pz² is just the square of each element on the diagonal. So the matrix for Pz² would be:

Row 1: (ħ)^2 = ħ², 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ²

So, again, it's diagonal with elements ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by (Pz²)_ii.

So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = |ψ₁|²*(ħ²) + |ψ₂|²*(0) + |ψ₃|²*(ħ²)
= (1/4)(ħ²) + (0) + (1/4)(ħ²)
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ²

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

We have ⟨Pz⟩ = 0, so ⟨Pz⟩² is zero.

Thus, ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2)

So the uncertainty is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the state vector components: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Compute |ψ₁|²: (1/2)^2 is 1/4. Correct.

|ψ₂|²: (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. Correct.

|ψ₃|²: same as ψ₁, 1/4. Correct.

⟨Pz⟩: (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨Pz²⟩: (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/2) ħ². Correct.

So ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). So option B is correct.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is expressed in the $P_z$ basis as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the respective basis states. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |a_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |a_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix of $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |a_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |a_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
