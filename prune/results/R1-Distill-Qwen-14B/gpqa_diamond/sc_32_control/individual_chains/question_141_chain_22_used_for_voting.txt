Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh right, that's para-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The numbering might be confusing. Oh wait, benzene-2-d probably refers to a benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but wait—if it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene or something like that? Wait, wait, the actual structure is probably 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, because sometimes the position is indicated as 1, 2, etc. Wait, perhaps it's para-bromodimethylbenzene? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene has a bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So the structure would be: the benzene ring with Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4, which are adjacent to each other—so that's a meta arrangement for the methyl groups relative to each other, but wait, 2 and 4 are actually para to each other. Wait no, if position 1 is Br, then position 2 is next to it, position 3 is next, etc. So positions 2 and 4 would be across from each other? No, wait, in benzene, each position is adjacent to two others. Let me draw it mentally. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is methyl, then position 3 is H, position 4 is methyl, position 5 is H, position 6 is H. So the substituents are at 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). So that makes the structure: Br at 1, Me at 2 and 4. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but the question is about treating this with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for elimination or dehydrohalogenation reactions, but in aromatic substitution, perhaps it's involved in some kind of elimination or coupling.

Wait, but wait, benzene is generally stable towards most conditions, but when there are substituents, especially deactivating groups, certain reactions can occur. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is a deprotonating agent. It's often used to deprotonate compounds to form strong bases, or it can abstract protons in elimination reactions.

Wait, but in the context of aromatic substitution, I'm trying to remember if this leads to some kind of aromatic elimination. Wait, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3 and is used for alkylation of aromatic rings. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that would form a double bond.

Wait, but wait, in aromatic compounds, when you have a good leaving group like Br in a position that's activated, perhaps a elimination reaction would occur. Wait, but wait, the bromide is in a position that's para to two methyl groups. The methyl groups are activating groups, so the ring is activated at certain positions.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Could it be that the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the Br, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond? But that doesn't make much sense because benzene is already a conjugated ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but that would require adjacent H and Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. The substituents are Br at position 1, and Me at 2 and 4. So the structure is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: Me
3: H
4: Me
5: H
6: H

Wait, so positions 2 and 4 are adjacent to the Br at 1, and across from each other (since 2 and 4 are separated by two positions). So the ring has Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps it's undergoing a demethylation or elimination.

Wait, but methyl groups are not easily deprotonated under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is leaving, and a double bond forms between adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in aromatic rings, elimination usually isn't straightforward because the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could form a new substituent.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a case of removing the bromide as a leaving group, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of a benzyne intermediate. Oh, wait, benzyne is a diradical formed by elimination of two substituents, typically when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base. But in this case, the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, if two substituents are present that are in positions that can undergo elimination when a strong base is applied, perhaps the reaction forms benzyne.

Wait, but wait, benzyne formation requires two leaving groups, like two bromides in adjacent positions. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base can eliminate HBr twice to form benzyne.

In our case, the starting material has Br at position 1 and Me at 2 and 4. So, the Br is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, which are two positions away from each other. So, the Br is at 1, and Me at 2 and 4.

If the NaNH2 acts as a base, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen adjacent to the Br. But wait, the positions adjacent to Br are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl group, so perhaps the H is at position 6. But the question is, can the base abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion, and then eliminate Br-.

Wait, but benzene doesn't typically lose substituents like that. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are involved.

Wait, another approach: maybe the methyl groups can be deprotonated. But methyl groups are pretty stable; they don't lose protons easily. But perhaps in such a strong base as NaNH2, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. However, the presence of methyl groups (activating, ortho/para-directing) and a Br (deactivating, meta-directing) complicates things.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's deprotonating something. Let me think about the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination of H and Br from adjacent positions, forming a double bond. But in benzene, that would create a ring with a double bond, but benzene is already a fully conjugated ring. So maybe it's forming a triple bond or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group. Wait, but methyl groups have H's that are less acidic than, say, allylic or aromatic protons. The pKa of methyl protons is around 50, while aromatic protons are around 43. Wait, but NaNH2 is a very strong base, with a pKa of around 35 for NH2- (since NH3 has a pKa around 38, so NH2- is stronger than that). So maybe it can deprotonate the methyl group. But wait, methyl groups attached to benzene are not very acidic. Wait, wait, the acidity of benzylic protons is higher than regular aliphatic protons. The pKa of toluene is around 43-44, if I remember correctly. So, NaNH2 (which has a base strength corresponding to a pKa around 35) should be able to deprotonate a benzylic position.

So, in this case, each methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. So the protons on the methyl groups are benzylic, so each CH3 has H's that are more acidic than regular aliphatic H's but less than aromatic H's. So NaNH2 is a strong enough base to abstract these benzylic H's.

Wait, so if the base abstracts a benzylic hydrogen from one of the methyl groups, that would form a carbanion. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-.

Wait, but wait, if a benzylic H is abstracted, adjacent to a methyl group, and the Br is on the benzene ring, perhaps elimination could occur. Wait, but the Br is on the ring, and the benzylic H is on the methyl group attached to the ring. So, maybe when the base abstracts a benzylic H, the adjacent C (the ring carbon) would have a negative charge? Or perhaps a neighboring group participation occurs, leading to the formation of a benzynelike structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the abstracted H leads to the loss of the Br, forming a triple bond. Oh wait, if a benzylic H is removed and the Br leaves, perhaps the ring forms a triple bond, creating a benzynelike intermediate. Let me think about that.

So, let's say the base abstracts a benzylic H from the methyl group at position 2. That would create a carbanion at position 2. Then, the Br at position 1 could leave as Br-. Wait, but that's not adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps when the H is abstracted, the adjacent C (the ring) is left with a negative charge, but that's not likely because the ring is aromatic.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is the elimination of the Br and a benzylic H, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Wait, but that would require that the benzylic H is on position 2 and the Br is on position 1. So, if the H is abstracted from position 2 (on the methyl group), then the Br is on position 1. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent on the benzene ring. So, the elimination would remove H from position 2 (benzylic) and Br from position 1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. That would form a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but benzyne is a high-energy diradical, but in this case, perhaps the reaction forms benzyne. But wait, how many possible products can form from this reaction?

Wait, let me think again: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the ring has Br at position 1, Me at 2 and 4.

When NaNH2 is added, the base can abstract benzylic H's from either the Me group at position 2 or the Me group at position 4. So, two possible positions for H abstraction: position 2's Me group and position 4's Me group.

If the H is abstracted from position 2's Me group, then the Br at position 1 can eliminate, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming a diradical or benzyne. Similarly, if the base abstracts a H from position 4's Me group, then the Br at position 1 is eliminated, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C4? Wait, but wait, position 4 is opposite position 1. Are positions 1 and 4 adjacent? No, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, and opposite to 4. So, if you abstract a H from position 4's Me group, then perhaps elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C4, but wait, they are across the ring, which is three bonds apart, so that might not be possible. Because elimination typically requires adjacent H and leaving group.

Wait, so the Br is at position 1, and the H's on the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, the H's on position 2's methyl are adjacent to the Br, since position 2 is next to position 1. The H's on position 4's methyl are not adjacent to the Br (since position 4 is across from position 1, via positions 2,3,4). So, perhaps only the H's on position 2's methyl are adjacent to the Br, allowing elimination. So, the base can abstract H from position 2's methyl, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but in that case, the H abstraction from position 2's methyl would allow for elimination, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a H from position 4's methyl, would that lead to elimination of the Br? Because position 4 is not adjacent to position 1, perhaps that's not possible. So, perhaps only one site for elimination.

Wait, but the Me groups are at positions 2 and 4. Let me number the ring:

1: Br
2: Me
3: H
4: Me
5: H
6: H

So, the Br is at position 1. The Me groups are at positions 2 and 4. The positions adjacent to position 1 are 2 and 6. So, the only H's adjacent to Br are those on the Me group at position 2 (since position 6 is H, not Me). So the base can abstract a H from position 2's Me group, which is adjacent to the Br. Then, elimination would occur, removing Br and H from position 2's Me, forming a triple bond between position 1 and 2, making a benzyne.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a H from position 4's Me group, which is not adjacent to the Br, perhaps that's not favorable. So, perhaps only one possible elimination site, leading to one product.

Wait, but what about the possibility of forming different products based on which H is abstracted from the Me group at position 2? Because the Me group has three H's, but all are equivalent in that position. So abstracting any of them would lead to the same outcome.

Wait, so the reaction leads to one product: a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming a diradical which can then undergo various reactions.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is highly reactive and can undergo various cycloaddition reactions, but in this case, since the solvent is condensed ammonia, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. NaNH2 in ammonia is used in the Birch reduction, but that's typically with aromatic rings and Li or Na in NH3, and under different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups, which we don't have here because the substituents are a Br (which is deactivating) and methyl groups (activating). So the ring's activation state is a bit mixed.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the NaNH2 is abstracting a proton from the ring itself, making it more reactive. Wait, but the ring is already deprotonated? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an Ullmann coupling, but that requires a copper catalyst and typically doesn't involve NaNH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the possible elimination products.

If the reaction forms a triple bond between C1 and C2, then the product would be a 1,2-diradical which is a high-energy species. However, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop there. If the benzene ring loses Br and H from adjacent positions, it forms a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne can then undergo various reactions, such as dimerization, or trapping with nucleophiles.

But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia. So perhaps the benzyne will undergo some reaction in that solvent.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products formed. So perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product, depending on where the elimination occurs.

Wait, but in the starting compound, only the Me group at position 2 is adjacent to Br. The Me group at position 4 is not adjacent. So, in that case, only one possible elimination: between Br at 1 and H at position 2. So only one product is formed.

But wait, wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the Me groups are at 2 and 4. The Br is at 1. So, the H on the Me at position 2 is adjacent to the Br. The H on the Me at position 4 is not adjacent to Br, so the base cannot abstract that H to cause elimination.

So, the base would only abstract the H from position 2's Me group, leading to elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming benzyne. Then, perhaps that benzyne could react in the solvent to form different products.

Wait, but in the presence of ammonia, perhaps the benzyne could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another equivalent of benzyne, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could capture an amide ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne would quickly form a dimer, but perhaps that's not the case because the solvent here is ammonia, which may not favor dimer formation.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne doesn't form, and the reaction stops at the elimination step, producing a diradical or a triple bond.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So perhaps the reaction produces benzyne, which is a diradical, but that wouldn't be an organic product as such—it's a reactive intermediate. So perhaps the reaction forms a single product, which is the triple bond structure, making it a single product.

But wait, wait, maybe the structure can form in more than one way. Let me think. No, because the starting material is symmetric in a way. Wait, perhaps the structure isn't symmetric, so elimination could occur in different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps if the starting structure allows for more than one site of elimination, but in this case, I don't think so because only the H from position 2's Me group is adjacent to Br. So, only one product is formed.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident here. Let me think again. The structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the Me groups are at 2 and 4, and Br at 1. So, the only H's adjacent to Br are on the Me at position 2. So, the base will abstract a H from there, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between 1 and 2, giving a single product.

So, the number of organic products formed would be one. Thus, the correct answer should be B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and hydrogen atoms at positions 3, 5, and 6. NaNH₂ is a strong base that can abstract benzylic protons, leading to elimination reactions.

Key points to consider:

1. **Structure of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene**:  
   - Bromine is at position 1.  
   - Methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4.  
   - Hydrogen atoms are at positions 3, 5, and 6.  

2. **Reactivity of NaNH₂**:  
   - NaNH₂ is a strong base capable of abstracting benzylic protons.  
   - Benzylic protons (e.g., on the methyl groups) are more acidic than regular aliphatic protons due to resonance stabilization.  

3. **Elimination Pathway**:  
   - The base can abstract a benzylic proton from the methyl group at position 2, which is adjacent to the bromine atom at position 1.  
   - This abstraction leads to the elimination of the bromine atom as Br⁻, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - The methyl group at position 4 is not adjacent to the bromine atom and cannot participate in elimination.  

4. **Possible Products**:  
   - Since only the methyl group at position 2 is adjacent to the bromine atom, elimination can occur at this site only.  
   - This results in a single product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2 (a benzyne intermediate).  

5. **Symmetry and Uniqueness of the Product**:  
   - The starting material is not symmetric, and elimination at position 2 leads to a single unique product.  

Thus, the reaction produces only one possible organic product.
