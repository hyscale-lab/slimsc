Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm³. The temperatures are 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions, so that's PO4^3- right? Because H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, and it dissociates stepwise. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). 

So the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about what each of these salts do in solution. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (but with water of crystallization). It dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. How does that come about?

Well, the HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-. The reaction would be HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. 

But wait, what about the H2PO4^- ions? They can also lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. But I think in this case, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present, the solution is a buffer system. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the two salts are providing these ions. 

But the problem is about the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-. So we need to consider how much HPO4^2- converts to PO4^3- in solution.

Hmm, but wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- may affect the concentration of PO4^3- through their own dissociations. So perhaps I need to calculate the contribution of each salt to the PO4^3- concentration.

Wait, but another thought: since both salts are present, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH of the solution can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the relevant pKa. 

What's the relevant pKa here? Since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pKa would be the second dissociation, which is Ka2 =6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207. 

Wait, because Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So if I can find the pH, then I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution is at 25°C, which is standard. So, let me proceed step by step.

First, find the concentrations of each salt in the solution.

The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol. 

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1 /177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

So in solution, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- ions: 0.00734 mol. 

Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-: 0.00561 mol.

So, the [H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

The [HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367)

Calculate the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7646.

log(0.7646) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.113 = 7.094.

Now, with this pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.25e-8 M.

So substituting in:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.25e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.25e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.049e-14 / 8.25e-8 ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Option B is 5.48e-7, option D is 3.97e-7.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I should consider the contribution from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to PO4^3-. Because H2PO4^- can also dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, which in turn can dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, no, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but it's the HPO4^2- that dissociates into PO4^3-.

So the main source is the HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, calculating Ka3: 1.8e-12, and [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M. [H+] is 8.25e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.25e-8).

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02805:

1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = (1.8 * 0.02805) * 1e-12 = approx 0.05049 * 1e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Then divide by 8.25e-8:

5.049e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.049 / 8.25) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.612 * 1e-6 = 6.12e-7 M.

So that gives approximately 6.12e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but a bit lower.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]. Let me recheck that.

pH was 7.094, so [H+] = 1e-7.094.

Wait, 10^(-7.094) = 10^( -7 -0.094 ) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.094).

What's 10^(-0.094)? Let me think, ln(10^(-0.094)) = -0.094 * ln(10) ≈ -0.094*2.3026 ≈ -0.2166, so exponentiating would be around e^-0.2166 ≈ 0.805. So 10^(-0.094) ≈ 0.805.

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.805 ≈ 8.05e-8 M.

Wait, that's a bit different from my previous 8.25e-8. So perhaps I miscalculated the pH.

Let me recalculate the pH.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

Their ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7646.

Log(0.7646) is log(7.646e-1) ≈ -0.113.

So pH = 7.207 -0.113 = 7.094. So [H+] is 1e-7.094 ≈ 8.05e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.05e-8) 

= (5.049e-14) / (8.05e-8) ≈ 6.27e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.27e-7, close to option A (6.24e-7). 

But let me be precise.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Calculate the ratio for [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 / 0.0367.

Let me compute that again.

0.02805 / 0.0367 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.001: 28.05 / 36.7.

28.05 ÷ 36.7:

36.7 * 0.764 = 28.0 (approx).

Yes, so 0.764.

Log(0.764) = ?

Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.764) is around -0.113, as I had before.

So pH is 7.207 - 0.113 = 7.094.

Now, [H+] = 10^-7.094.

Calculating 10^-7.094:

Let me compute it more precisely.

7.094 = 7 + 0.094.

10^-7 = 1e-7.

10^-0.094 = ?

We can use the formula ln(10^x) = x ln(10), so ln(10^-0.094) = -0.094 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2165.

e^-0.2165 ≈ 0.805.

So 10^-0.094 ≈ 0.805.

Thus, [H+] ≈ 8.05e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.05e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = (1.8 * 0.02805) * 1e-12.

1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049.

0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.05e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.05e-8 = (5.049 / 8.05) * 1e-6.

5.049 ÷ 8.05 = approximately 0.627.

So 0.627e-6 = 6.27e-7 M.

This is very close to option A: 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations.

Let me compute 1.8 * 0.02805 more accurately.

1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, 5.049e-14 divided by 8.05e-8: let's compute it as (5.049 / 8.05) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.049 / 8.05:

8.05 × 0.627 = 5.04985 (since 0.6 *8.05=4.83, 0.027 *8.05=0.21735; 4.83 +0.21735=5.04735, which is close).

So 5.049 /8.05 ≈ 0.627.

0.627 × 1e-6 = 6.27e-7.

So the concentration is approximately 6.27e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M → 6.24 is close to 6.27.

B) 5.48e-7 → lower.

C) 2.81e-7 → much lower.

D) 3.97e-7 → lower.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I miss any other sources of PO4^3-?

The other salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. The only way PO4^3- comes is from HPO4^2- dissociation. So I think the calculation is correct.

But wait, another thought: could the H2PO4^- also dissociate further? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which can then donate another to become PO4^3-.

But in the calculation, I already considered the HPO4^2- and its dissociation, so maybe that's all.

Another thing to consider: activity coefficients, but I think for this problem, we can ignore that and proceed with concentrations.

So the answer should be option A, 6.24e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation reactions and relevant equilibrium constants (Ka values) for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:

1. **H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)  
2. **H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻** (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)  
3. **HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻** (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of ions
- **KH₂PO₄** dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻.  
  Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.00734}{0.2} = 0.0367 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O** dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻.  
  Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.00561}{0.2} = 0.02805 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

- \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \).  
- Ratio = \( \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \approx 0.7646 \).  
- \( \log(0.7646) \approx -0.113 \).  

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.113 = 7.094
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

- \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.05 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.05 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]

- Numerator: \( (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805) \approx 5.049 \times 10^{-14} \).  
- Denominator: \( 8.05 \times 10^{-8} \).  
- \[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.05 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

Answer: A
