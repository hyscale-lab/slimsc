Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, right, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the velocities, because of the speed addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, no, that's for when one is moving with v1 and the other v2 in the same direction. Wait, no, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))—but wait, actually, I think I might have it backwards. Let me get this straight.

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Astronaut B is 3m with speed 0.5c. We want the speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa? Oh, wait, the problem says "relative speed", which is a bit ambiguous. But in relativity, relative speed isn't symmetric. So I need to clarify which way we're considering. Hmm, the problem says, "What will be the relative speed"—probably from A's perspective, since A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the speed of B relative to A, so v_rel is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²))).

Wait, no, wait. The speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²)) because A is moving at vA in the lab frame. But wait, are the astronauts moving in the same direction or opposite? Oh, the problem says both in the positive x-direction. So their velocities are in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, no, the formula should be (vB' - vA') where those are the speeds in the same direction. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity addition. Let me recall the velocity addition formula.

If object B is moving at velocity u in the lab frame, and the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the moving frame (say, the frame of astronaut A), then the velocity of B in A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, u is 0.5c (B's speed in lab frame), and v is 0.6c (A's speed in lab frame). So the relative speed of B as seen from A is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that numerator and denominator. Numerator is (-0.1c). Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction. Since the problem asks for the relative speed, the magnitude would be 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total is the sum of their energies.

The energy of each is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A (2m, 0.6c): gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1-0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 → 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B (3m, 0.5c): gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) → 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C is E=5.96 mc^2, and option B is E=4.96.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c and energy is ~5.96 mc². So that points to option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. So (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c, then divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) → (−0.1c)/(1 − 0.3) → (−0.1c)/0.7 → about −0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct options are either C or D. Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C says v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D says v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2.

So the correct energy is approximately 5.96, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the problem asks for the speed, so the magnitude is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A (\(m = 2m, v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (\(m = 3m, v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect relative speed and energy.
- **Option B**: Incorrect energy.
- **Option C**: Correct relative speed (\(0.14c\)) and energy (\(5.96m c^2\)).
- **Option D**: Incorrect energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
