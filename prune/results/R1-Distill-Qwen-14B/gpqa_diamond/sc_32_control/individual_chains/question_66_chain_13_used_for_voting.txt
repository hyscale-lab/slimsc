Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, and they parameterize beyond the Standard Model physics.

Now, about symmetries. I think that SMEFT is built in a way that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain symmetries like Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry, and some others. But wait, the question is about which symmetries are "must be respected by all operators."

Option 1 is Lorentz Symmetry. Well, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all its operators and the added ones in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So I think 1 is correct.

Option 2 is Poincare Symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT includes all SM symmetries, which would include Poincare (because SM is relativistic), so operators must respect that. So 2 is also correct.

Option 3 is CP symmetry. Wait, I'm not so sure. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric, right? Because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the SM, CP isn't a symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory based on SM, I don't think the operators must respect CP. Because higher-dimension operators can break CP if the original theory didn't have it. So 3 might not be a must.

Option 4 is CPT symmetry. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because that's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So even if the theory doesn't have CP symmetry, it must have CPT. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which options are correct? The question lists options 1,2,3,4 as the possible answers.

Looking at the choices:

A) 1,2 → So Poincare and Lorentz. That's correct in a way, but wait, what about CPT?

B) 3,4 → No, because 1 and 2 are more likely correct.

C) 1,2,4 → So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. That makes sense because all operators must respect these.

D) 1,3,4 → So Lorentz, CP, CPT. But I don't think they have to respect CP.

Wait, but wait—does SMEFT require operators to conserve CP? Since the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry, SMEFT operators can violate CP. So all operators don't need to respect CP. So 3 is not a must.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so Poincare is included as it's the combination of translations and Lorentz. Also, as a QFT, it must have CPT symmetry.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that should be the correct answer.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). These include Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. However, CP symmetry is not a requirement because the SM already violates CP, and SMEFT operators can reflect this.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of relativistic quantum field theories, including SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations and is a broader symmetry of relativistic theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it also respects Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation, and SMEFT inherits this property. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and all Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
