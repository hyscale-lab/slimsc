Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. When dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. I remember the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me get that straight.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. If I want the relative speed of B from A's frame, it should be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²), where v is the speed of B and u of A? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Wait, the frame of A is moving at u = 0.6c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at v - u, but we need to calculate it relativistically.

Wait no, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), right? So here, let me plug in u as 0.6c and v as 0.5c? Wait, wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if I'm in A's frame, then A is stationary, and B is moving. So B's speed relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (v u/c²)). Here, v is B's speed in the lab frame, which is 0.5c, and u is A's speed, 0.6c.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is the velocity of object B as seen from A's frame. So the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)), where v is the velocity of B relative to the lab, and u is the velocity of A relative to the lab.

So substituting, v is 0.5c (B's speed) and u is 0.6c (A's speed). Plugging into the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857c, approximately. Oh wait, but speed is positive, so it's 0.142857c in magnitude. So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but wait. The formula is for the relative velocity when the objects are moving in the same direction. So if u is the velocity of the frame (A's frame), and v is the velocity of B in the lab frame, then in A's frame B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²).

So that calculation gives a relative speed of about 0.14c. So one of the options has a relative speed of 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel=0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So I need to calculate the total energy as the sum of the energies of each astronaut.

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma for A: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * m_A c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma for B: gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * m_B c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together, E_total ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option B has E=4.96. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the gamma calculations.

For A: 0.6c. 1 - (0.6)^2 = 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1.25. So E_A = 2m *1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

For B: 0.5c. 1 -0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B=3m *1.1547 c²≈3.464 m c².

Sum is 2.5 +3.464=5.964≈5.96. So yes, option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to determine the relative speed of one object from the frame of another:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_B v_A}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) (Astronaut A's speed) and \(v_B = 0.5c\) (Astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]
The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
