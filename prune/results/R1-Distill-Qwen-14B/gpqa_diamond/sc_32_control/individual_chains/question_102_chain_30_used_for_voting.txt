Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the setup: It's about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So, they're probably cell surface proteins interacting.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has two genes: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutively active. The receptor is after an IRES element, which is a way to have two genes in one vector. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed in a different cell type or under different regulation.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So, the idea is that Cre will excise the stop cassette, allowing the genes to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot. After transfecting into primary astrocyte culture, they see signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed when transfected.

But when they breed the mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring aren't showing a green signal under the microscope. So the eGFP (which is part of the receptor construct) isn't being expressed.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest derivatives, like Schwann cells and melanocytes. So, in the offspring, Cre should be active in those cells, which would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes.

So in the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter, followed by a stop with loxP. The receptor has an IRES, then a stop with lox2272. When Cre is present, it should delete the stop cassettes. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed. So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell, right? Because if the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, then maybe the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be in the same cell. But the construct is in the same vector, so both should be in the same cell. Unless the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the surface. But the issue is why eGFP isn't expressed, not about their interaction.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein isn't trafficking properly. But the Western blot would show the protein is present because the blot is looking for overexpressed proteins, which were detected. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, the blot might not show it, but the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin after transfection. So the proteins are expressed when transfected, but in the mice, maybe they're not expressed.

Wait, but in the mice, the Cre is supposed to activate the constructs. So after Cre recombination, the ligand and receptor should be expressed, right? But in the Western blot, they tested the construct expression after transfection, which worked. So the problem is probably in the mouse model.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the receptor isn't being correctly expressed. The Western blot was when they transfected the plasmid, but in the mouse, maybe the construct isn't properly recombined.

Wait, but the mouse construct is presumably a knock-in, maybe under a promoter that's only active in certain cells. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong and maybe constitutive. Wait, no: the construct might be in a loxP arrangement. Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is present, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But wait, the vector design: the ligand is first, then the stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the receptor, which has an IRES, then the lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of ligand and receptor. When Cre is expressed, it should delete the stop cassettes. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES.

Wait, if the Cre is only active in certain tissues, like SOX10-Cre activates in neural crest derivatives, then the ligand and receptor will be expressed there. But the offspring's eGFP isn't observed. So why?

Possibility: The recombinational excision didn't happen. Why wouldn't the Cre work? Because the mouse is homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous. So the offspring are heterozygous for the construct and hemizygous for SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line, so when crossed, they should have Cre active in neural crest cells.

But perhaps the construct wasn't properly recombined. So the stop cassettes are still present, preventing expression of the receptor. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised.

Wait, but the initial vector uses different lox sites. The ligand stop uses loxP, and the receptor stop uses lox2272. Is that correct? Because Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't recognize unless it's in a specific arrangement, but I'm not sure. Wait, lox2272 is a synthetic variant of loxP. Cre can still cut lox2272, but it's a different arrangement, perhaps for dual recombinase systems (like using Cre and another recombinase). Or maybe in this case, the lox2272 is just another site that Cre can recognize. So the presence of Cre would excise the lox2272 stop cassette as well.

If the Cre is not active, the stop cassettes remain, so neither the ligand nor the receptor would be expressed. But the mice are supposed to have SOX10-Cre, which should drive Cre expression in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So maybe the vector is designed such that Cre is expressed under a promoter, and allows for recombination in the mouse. Alternatively, the Cre may be under a specific promoter.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the Cre gene under a promoter that is only active in certain cells. But the question says they created a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the construct itself doesn't include a Cre, but the SOX10-Cre transgene is providing Cre.

But in the mouse, Cre is only active in SOX10-expressing cells. So in the neural crest cells, Cre is active, and should recombine the lox sites.

But maybe the problem is that the loxP and lox2272 sites are on opposite strands or something, making the Cre unable to recombine. Or perhaps the presence of two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) isn't compatible for Cre-mediated recombination.

Wait, no, Cre can recognize lox2272 sites. So if the stop cassettes are between the ligand and mCherry (loxP), and between receptor and eGFP (lox2272), then Cre should be able to excise both.

But why isn't eGFP expressed? Another possibility: the eGFP is not correctly in frame, so the protein doesn't get made. Looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly excised, or the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor.

Wait, the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre deletes the lox2272-stop-lox2272, the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP. Are they in frame? If the stop was in frame, and Cre deletes it, then the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. If the stop was out of frame, maybe the frame is disrupted.

Wait, no, the stop is in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the cassette is present, so the receptor's ORF is terminated. When Cre recombines, the stop is removed, so the receptor's ORF continues into eGFP.

So if the stop is in frame, then without Cre, the receptor is truncated. With Cre, it's full length, and eGFP is added correctly. So the frame depends on the stop's placement.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly designed, and the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to a frameshift and no functional eGFP.

But why does the Western blot show expression when transfected? Because when the plasmid is transfected, the stop cassettes are present, but perhaps in the plasmid they're in a way that allows expression. Or maybe in the plasmid, the cassettes are not efficiently recombined. Wait, the question says they transfected primary astrocytes and saw signals. So the plasmid, when transfected, allows the ligand and receptor to be expressed without Cre? Because in the plasmid, maybe the stop cassettes are not efficiently recombining, or maybe the cells don't have Cre, so they can't excise them. Wait, but the cells are primary astrocytes, which probably don't express Cre unless transfected with a vector. So if the construct is transfected into astrocytes, the stop cassettes would prevent expression unless Cre is present. But the question says that the Western blot showed expression. Hmm, maybe the plasmid isn't using the stop cassettes, or maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, no—because the plasmid is a bicistronic vector with the ligand under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette, then the receptor under IRES, then another stop. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would block expression. Unless the CBA promoter is strong enough to leak through. Or maybe the plasmid has some other features.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The stop cassette is after the ligand, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the downstream receptor isn't. But the question says the ligand is fused to mCherry. So maybe when they transfected the plasmid, the ligand and mCherry are expressed because the stop cassette is not in the way. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the construct.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So the ligand is followed by mCherry, but there's a stop cassette in between. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent the ligand and mCherry from being expressed? Or is the ligand and mCherry in the same ORF, with the stop cassette after that?

Wait, the setup says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP.

But between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. Without Cre, the ligand would terminate, and mCherry wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that after transfecting, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the plasmid, without Cre, allows some expression. Maybe the mCherry is being expressed because the stop is not properly placed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in a way that allows expression of the ligand but not mCherry. But the Western blot is for the overexpressed proteins, which are the ligand and receptor. So perhaps the ligand is expressed but not mCherry.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF.

Wait, in the vector: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. Then, IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no, perhaps the order is: [CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry. Then, [IRES] --> receptor ORF --> stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP.

So, without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression beyond them. So ligand would be expressed, but not mCherry. The receptor would not be expressed because it's after the IRES, but the IRES allows internal initiation, so perhaps the receptor is expressed regardless of the stop. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the ligand and receptor are on the same transcript, but separated by IRES. So the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES drives the receptor's expression. But the stop cassettes are in between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the expression without Cre.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are present. So ligand ORF is followed by stop, so ligand is expressed, but nothing beyond it. Similarly, the receptor ORF is after IRES, but the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP not. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, which don't have Cre, the ligand and receptor would be expressed, but the mCherry and eGFP wouldn't.

But the question says that after transfecting, the Western blot shows signals for the proteins, which were detected proportionally to actin. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are expressed, but the mCherry and eGFP aren't. So when they use antibodies against the overexpressed ligand and receptor, they see signals.

Now, in the mouse model, the construct is inserted into the genome. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed, and mCherry and eGFP as well. But in the offspring, the eGFP isn't observed under the confocal, which is looking for the receptor-eGFP.

Possible issues:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is added to the receptor in a way that causes a frameshift, the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might not be correctly made. But the Western blot would still show the receptor if it's expressed. Or maybe the construct is designed so that the eGFP is only expressed when the stop is removed. If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't made. But in the mouse model, the Cre should have removed the stop.

Option C: the enhancer for expression is missing. If the construct lacks necessary regulatory elements, the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot after transfection showed expression, so the construct does have the necessary promoters. Unless the mouse's genomic context is different.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking properly, it wouldn't be at the cell surface. But the Western blot would show the protein is present, so why no signal? The eGFP is a fluorescent tag; if the protein is stuck in the Golgi, it might not be on the surface, so you wouldn't see it under confocal, which typically looks for surface markers. But the Western blot would detect the protein regardless. So maybe the blot shows the receptor is present, but in the mouse, it's not on the surface. But the question says they don't observe a green signal, implying the eGFP isn't expressed.

So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why would that be?

If the lox2272 sites are not correctly recombined, the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. Alternatively, maybe the Cre isn't active, so the stop isn't removed.

But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should provide Cre in the neural crest cells. So why isn't the stop cassette excised?

Wait, another possibility: the vector has the IRES before the receptor, but the IRES is not working correctly. So even after Cre excises the stop, the receptor isn't expressed. But then why would the ligand be expressed?

Alternatively, maybe the loxP and lox2272 sites are on the same DNA strand, making the Cre unable to recombine. Or perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are in a configuration that prevents recombination.

Wait, loxP is a 34 bp recognition site, and lox2272 is a modified version. Cre can cut both, but the arrangement affects how they are recombined. If the lox sites are in opposite orientations, the recombination won't occur properly.

Wait, in the construct, the ligand's stop is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the loxP sites are in a certain orientation. The receptor's stop is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the lox2272 sites are in a certain orientation.

If the construct is made such that both stops are in the same orientation, then Cre can recombine them. But if the lox sites are in opposite orientations, the stops can't be excised. Or perhaps the lox2272 sites are in a way that Cre can't recombine them. But I think Cre can recognize lox2272.

Another angle: The vector uses loxP and lox2272, which are different sites. Cre can recombine both, but perhaps they're not in the right configuration for complete excision of the stop cassettes. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 sites are in a way that upon Cre recombination, the eGFP is not expressed.

Wait, the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So Cre can excise both. So after Cre recombination, both stops are gone. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the stop for the receptor-eGFP wasn't excised. But why?

Wait, perhaps the vector uses a different strain, and the Cre isn't active. Or maybe the Cre is active but the vector isn't properly integrated.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. Without the IRES, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot showed expression when transfected, so perhaps the IRES works.

Wait, no, the Western blot result: they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes. In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent mCherry and eGFP from being expressed. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed. The receptor is after IRES, which might allow expression without the stop, but if the stop is present, maybe the receptor isn't expressed.

But according to the question, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So perhaps both the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, which is under CBA. So the ligand is expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed in the same transcript. So without Cre, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, no: the stop is after the receptor. Wait, the order is ligand, then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272). So without Cre, the receptor's ORF is followed by stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot shows signals, which suggests that the receptor is being expressed.

This is getting complicated. Let's look for another angle.

The Western blot detects the overexpressed proteins, implying that the ligand and receptor are expressed. But in the mouse, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't visible. So the issue is with eGFP expression.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is added in a way that causes a frameshift, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, and the receptor might be truncated. But the Western blot would show a truncated receptor, perhaps. But the question says the Western blot after transfection showed signals, which were proportional to actin. So perhaps the plasmid construct allows for some expression, but the knock-in mouse doesn't.

Wait, another possibility: the vector has the ligand and receptor in a way that the lox sites are in a configuration that can't be recombined by Cre. For example, if the loxP and lox2272 sites are in a way that they form a larger recombinant circle that isn't possible, then the stops aren't excised.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 recognition sites are in a way that the Cre can't excise them. But I think Cre can recognize lox2272.

Alternatively, maybe the vector uses a different strain of Cre that isn't active, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the IRES is not properly positioned, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot suggests that the receptor is expressed.

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not correctly attached, so it's not fluorescent. But the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which are the ligand and receptor, not eGFP. So the eGFP's expression isn't directly detected in the blot.

In the mouse model, only the eGFP should be expressed in the cells where Cre is active. If the Cre isn't active, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in their neural crest cells.

Wait, but the SOX10-Cre mice are hemizygous. The offspring would inherit the construct from the homozygous parent and the Cre from the hemizygous. So the Cre should be active in the right cells.

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't correctly knocked in. Maybe the construct wasn't properly integrated into the genome, so the stops aren't flanked by lox sites. But the question says they successfully bred a mouse model homozygous for the construct.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the vector uses two different lox sites, and the Cre can't effectively recombine both. For example, lox2272 may require a different Cre variant, but I don't think that's the case.

Another possibility: the vector requires both loxP and lox2272 sites to be recombined, but Cre can only recombine one type. Wait, Cre can recognize both, but the arrangement may matter. Perhaps the vector requires both loxP and lox2272 to be recombined, but only one is being cut. So the ligand's stop is excised, but not the receptor's, leaving eGFP not expressed.

Wait, no, because each stop has its own lox sites. The ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and the receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP. So Cre would excise both stops independently.

Wait, but in the question, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same construct. When you cross them with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stops in each allele.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Another idea: perhaps the vector has the ligand and mCherry in the same reading frame, but the receptor and eGFP are not. So when the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP.

So option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent eGFP from being expressed, which matches the observation.

So, the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, where the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. When Cre is introduced, these stop cassettes should be excised, allowing expression of the ligand, mCherry, receptor, and eGFP. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on a neighboring cell, but the construct is designed to express both ligand and receptor in the same cell. The absence of eGFP fluorescence is not explained by their interaction being paracrine. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were mislocalized in the Golgi, it would not be detectable at the cell surface under confocal microscopy. However, the Western blot after transfection showed expression of the receptor, indicating that the protein is being synthesized. This suggests the issue is not with trafficking but rather with expression. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The Western blot after transfection confirmed expression of both proteins, indicating that the necessary regulatory elements are present. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The construct design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP. If the stop cassette is not excised, eGFP would not be expressed. However, the absence of eGFP could also occur if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame after recombination. If the stop cassette is removed but the frame is disrupted, eGFP would not be expressed, and the receptor might be truncated. This aligns with the observation of no green signal under confocal microscopy. This is the most likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP. 

**Answer: D**
