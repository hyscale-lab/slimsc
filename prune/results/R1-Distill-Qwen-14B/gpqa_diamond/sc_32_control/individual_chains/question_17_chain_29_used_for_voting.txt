Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's a 1:1 complex because calcium has a +2 charge and EDTA has a -4 charge, I think. Wait, no, wait, EDTA is usually in the form of H4Y, but when it's deprotonated, it's Y^4-. So the complex would be CaY^2-, right? So the formula would be CaY^2- with a 1:1 ratio.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That's the concentration of the complex formed. Now, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is given by the equation Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, EDTA is a polydentate ligand, so the complex formation is a bit more involved, but I think for this problem, the basic formula applies.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives us K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant for the complex. So Kf = 5e10.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M.

But we're in a solution where the complex dissociates a bit. The free calcium ions and free EDTA ions are present, but their concentrations are very small because Kf is large, meaning the complex is very stable. So the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be small.

The equation is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA in solution comes from the dissociation. But wait, the EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in its deprotonated form, Y^4-, it can form the complex.

Wait, but in pure solution, the EDTA may not be fully deprotonated. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [EDTA^4-] is the same as the concentration of free EDTA. So, in this ideal pH condition, the concentration of Y^4- is sufficient, so we can ignore any protonation effects.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the solution dissociates into Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

Let me set up the variables.

Let’s say the concentration of calcium ions is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is y.

But wait, the complex dissociates as CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. As it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of Y^4-. So, at equilibrium, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, because when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex produces one mole each of Ca^2+ and Y^4-. So, the change is x for both. So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x (but if x is very small, this would be approximately 0.02)

[Ca^2+] = x

[Y^4-] = x

Wait, no, because if x is the amount dissociated per mole, then:

If the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by x, then:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x

[Ca^2+] = x

[Y^4-] = x

But because Kf is so large (5e10), which implies that the complex is very stable, x would be very small. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Then, Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = (0.02)/(x^2) ) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

We can solve for x.

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) ) = (2/(5e12)) ) = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no: 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no: 2e-2 is 2 *1e-2.

5e10 is 5*1e10.

So, (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12.

2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 1e-7. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7, so sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 = approx 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.32e-7 M.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2.0x10^-2 M → 0.02 M

B)5.0x10^-3 M →0.005 M

C)6.3x10^-7 M → 6.3e-7 M

D)1.0x10^-2 M →0.01 M

So the answer would be option C, 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Another approach: Since Kf is very large, the complex is almost completely un dissociated, so x is very small compared to 0.02. So, I can approximate [CaY^2-] as 0.02. Then:

5e10 ≈ 0.02/(x^2)

x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) )

Which is sqrt( (2e-12)/(5) ) → sqrt( (2/5) * 1e-12 ) → sqrt(0.4e-12) → sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 as before.

Which is about 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in the presence of excess EDTA, the concentration of free metal ions is very low. But in this case, the solution is only the complex, so all EDTA is tied up in the complex except for the little that dissociates. So my initial setup is correct.

Alternatively, let me think about the assumption that x is small. Let's plug in x≈6e-7 into 0.02 - x. 0.02 is 0.02 M, which is 2e-2 M. 6e-7 is way smaller, so the approximation holds. So yes, the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( x \). At equilibrium:
- \([CaY^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M),
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([Y^{4-}] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

**Options Analysis:**
- **A) \( 2.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \):** This is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, not free calcium ions.
- **B) \( 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \):** This is too large for free calcium ions, as the complex is very stable.
- **C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \):** Matches the calculated concentration of free calcium ions.
- **D) \( 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \):** This is also too large for free calcium ions.

The correct answer is **C**.
