Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (pl) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So, a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a more distant star has a smaller parallax. I remember that the formula is something like pl = 1/d, where d is the distance. So, if pl is small, the star is far away, and if pl is large, it's nearby.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, we're looking at how the density of stars changes as we look at different ranges of plx. Let's think about volume. Oh wait, stars are three-dimensional objects in space, so their distribution would depend on the volume they occupy.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. But we're observing them, so the way we count them is affected by their distance. Because as we go further away, each subsequent shell (like a thin spherical shell at a certain distance) has a larger volume, but the same number density. So the number of stars in each shell increases with distance.

Wait, no. Wait, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of the shell. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. So, if the number density is n (stars per volume), the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr. So, the number of stars increases with d².

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx (p) is inversely proportional to d, d = 1/p. So, substituting d = 1/p into the expression for the number of stars in a shell:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/p)^2 dr.

Wait, and what's dr in terms of parallax? Let me think. If d = 1/p, then dr is the change in d. So dr = - (1/p²) dp because p and d are inversely related. Hmm, because as p decreases, d increases. Oh, wait, no: Let's see, if p increases, d decreases. So, for a small change in p, dp, the change in d is dr = - (1/p²) dp. Because d = 1/p, so derivative is -1/p². So, dr = - (1/p²) dp. But since the number of stars is a positive quantity, I can take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) |dp|.

So substituting back into the number of stars in a shell of parallax between p and p + dp, the number is n * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. And d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². And dr is (1/p²) dp. So putting it together:

Number of stars in shell = n * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp.

Which simplifies to n * 4π / p^4 * dp. So, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's the number as a function of p. So, perhaps the way to think about it is the number density in p space.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d². But d is 1/p, so it's proportional to (1/p)^2. So, the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p², but wait, the shell in p space is a unit change in p. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, the number of stars per unit p is the number of stars in a shell of thickness dp. So, if the number of stars in the shell is proportional to (d² dr), and dr is (1/p²) dp, then:

Number of stars in shell = k * d² dr = k * (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) = k * (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars per unit p (since dp is the unit) is proportional to 1/p^4. That would suggest option A) ~ 1/p^4.

But wait, looking back at the question, it says "number of stars per unit range of parallax." So, the count you get when you look at a slice of the sky with a certain parallax range. So, if you have a range dp, the number you count is proportional to 1/p^4. So, the number per unit range (dp) is ~ 1/p^4.

But wait, let me think about the options. Option A is ~ 1/p^4. So that's the number per unit range.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Think about the solid angle and how parallax relates to distance.

Alternatively, considering that in a universe where stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars you can see with a parallax less than p_max is proportional to p_max^3. Because the volume increases with p^3 (since volume scales as d^3, and d is 1/p, so volume is (1/p)^3, so the integral over p would be something like integral from 0 to p_max of 1/p^3 dp, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the cumulative number of stars with parallax less than p is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to d^3. Since d = 1/p, the volume is proportional to (1/p)^3. So, the number of stars up to p is N(p) = n * Volume = n * (4/3) π (d)^3 = n * (4/3) π (1/p)^3.

So, for a small change in p, dN = -dN/dp dp (since p is decreasing as d increases). Let me compute dN/dp. dN/dp = d/dp [n (4/3 π) (1/p^3) ) ] = n (4/3 π) (-3) (1/p^4) ) = -4 n π / p^4.

The negative sign indicates that as p decreases (distance increases), the number of stars added decreases, which makes sense. But the magnitude is dN = (4 n π / p^4 ) dp. So, the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. Which again suggests that option A is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, when plx increases, the number of stars in that range should decrease. Because more nearby stars have higher plx, but as plx increases, each unit of plx (e.g., from p to p+dp) would contain fewer stars because the volume is smaller.

Wait, but in reality, the number of stars per unit plx (dp) goes as 1/p^4. So, as p increases, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but in the question, the stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number of stars in a small volume is proportional to the volume. So, if we have a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr, the volume is 4π d² dr. The number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dr.

But d = 1/p, so substituting, it becomes n * 4π (1/p²) dr. And dr is (1/p²) dp. So, the number of stars in a shell of parallax dp is n *4π (1/p^2) (1/p²) dp) = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars per unit of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. That's option A.

But wait, the options are about how the number changes with plx. So, the number decreases as plx increases, but at what rate? It's proportional to 1/p^4, so the number per unit plx goes as 1/p^4. So the correct option is A.

Alternatively, another approach: think about the flux or the count. The number of stars we observe in a given direction is related to the surface density, but since we're considering all directions, it's about the density in space.

Wait, but I think the initial approach is correct. So, the number of stars per unit p (per unit parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in the shell is also proportional to the number density \( n \), giving:

\[
\text{Number of stars in shell} \propto n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr.
\]

Substituting \( d = 1/p \), the volume of the shell becomes proportional to \( (1/p^2) dr \). Additionally, \( dr \) can be expressed in terms of \( dp \) as \( dr = -(1/p^2) dp \), where the negative sign accounts for the inverse relationship between \( d \) and \( p \). Substituting \( dr = (1/p^2) dp \) (taking the absolute value for simplicity), the number of stars in a shell of parallax range \( dp \) becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars in shell} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means that as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases more steeply, following the \( 1/p^4 \) relationship.

From the given options:
- **A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \)**: Correct, as derived above.
- **B) ~ \( 1/p^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is steeper than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ \( 1/p^1 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is steeper than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ \( 1/p^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is steeper than \( 1/p^3 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
