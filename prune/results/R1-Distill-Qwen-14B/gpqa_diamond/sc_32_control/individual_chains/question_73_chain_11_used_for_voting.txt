Okay, I have this physics problem in front of me. So, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right, relativistic mechanics.

So, the problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. What's their relative speed and the total energy?

Wait, so first, relative speed. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. I think it's (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but which direction? Oh, because both are moving in the same direction, right? So the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by a factor.

Wait, wait, no, wait. The formula is v = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me get the order right. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first from the second's frame would be (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction, then from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5*c²)/(c²)). Wait, that's (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So I can note that.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy of each astronaut is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, wait. The total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. Each has energy gamma*m*c². So for each, calculate their gamma, multiply by m, then sum.

Wait, but the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * m_total. Wait, wait, no: the energy is gamma * m * c^2. So for first astronaut, E1 = gamma * (2m) c². Wait, wait, no, wait: Wait, the mass given is 2m. So, E1 = gamma_1 * (2m) c². Similarly for E2.

Wait, no, actually, relativistic energy is E = gamma m c². So for each, their energy is based on their own mass and speed. So let's compute each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc². So the correct energy is around 5.96, so option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the gamma calculations. For the second astronaut, (v=0.5c), so v²/c² is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. The square root of that is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So yes, E2 is 1.1547 * 3 m c² = 3.464 m c². And E1 is 2.5 m c². Sum is 5.964 m c². So that's approximately 5.96, so the option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, another thought: in relativity, when you have two objects moving in the same frame, the total energy is just the sum of their individual energies in that frame. So yeah, that's what I did.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. So that's the right answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) matches the results.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
