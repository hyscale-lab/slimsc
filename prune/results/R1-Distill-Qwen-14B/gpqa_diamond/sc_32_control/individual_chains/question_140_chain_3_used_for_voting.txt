Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think it out step by step.

The question involves a reaction between Substance X and liquid Y, which produces gas W, a precipitate G, and B upon heating. There are some clues about the properties of these substances, and I need to figure out what Substance X is, and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it. The options given are numbers, so I think the sum of two atomic masses is one of those.

Let me break down the information:

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. This suggests that the element has isotopes; maybe it's something like chlorine (which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37) or something similar. Also, X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, especially a close analog. Hmm, common reagents in organic chemistry... Maybe something like concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or a halogen like bromine or iodine? Wait, but X reacts with liquid Y violently. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but I'm not sure if it fits all the clues.

2. **Reaction with Liquid Y**: Violently, releasing Gas W. W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let me think about simple gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton and 1 neutron each. But wait, H has only one proton and one electron, and each H atom has 0 neutrons (since protium is ^1H). Wait, no, because if it's H2, each molecule has 2 H atoms, so total protons: 2, total neutrons: 0. That doesn't match. Another option: maybe CO2? No, that's a gas, but not sure about the neutron count. Wait, perhaps water vapor? No, because H2O is a liquid sometimes. Wait, another approach: the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule can be something like O2 or N2? Let's see, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16. O2 molecule would have 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So 16 each. That fits. Or maybe something else.

Wait, the gas W is produced when X reacts with Y. So if X is a halogen, perhaps when it reacts with a metal, it might produce HX gas. But wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is a strong acid, like H2SO4 reacting with a metal, it could produce H2 gas. Oh wait! Let me think about this.

If Y is a metal, perhaps, and X is an acid. For example, if X is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and Y is a metal like zinc or magnesium. Then, the reaction would produce hydrogen gas. Let me check: H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (each H atom is ^1H). So protons = 2, neutrons = 0. That's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps W is CO2? Let's think: CO2 has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2=22) and for neutrons: C is 6 neutrons, O has 8 each. So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule has same number of each. That fits the clue.

So if W is CO2, what would that imply? The reaction between X and Y produces CO2. Hmm. So X and Y must react to form CO2. Let's think about what substances produce CO2 upon reaction. One possibility is when a carbonate reacts with an acid. For example, if Y is a carbonate salt and X is an acid, like H2SO4. Then, X would react with Y (like Na2CO3) to produce CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate. But the problem says Y is a liquid. Acids are often liquid, but the carbonate would be a solid. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Carbonates are used in some reactions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Another possibility: When a metal reacts with a strong acid, perhaps producing hydrogen gas. But earlier that didn't fit.

Wait, another angle: when a chlorinated compound reacts with a base. For example, maybe X is Cl2 (chlorine gas), Y is a base like NaOH. But then, the reaction would produce Cl- and something else. Wait, Cl2 + NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O. No CO2 there. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe if X is a carbonate and Y is a metal. Wait, but that might not produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me go back to the other clues. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius. What compounds have a melting point near 4°C? Well, water freezes at 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. Wait, that's just a bit above 0. Another thought: perhaps B is something like sodium bicarbonate, which decomposes when heated. Wait, but I'm not sure about its melting point.

Another common substance with a melting point near that is maybe ammonium chloride? No, I think it's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something like NaOH? No, NaOH's melting point is much higher. Wait, perhaps B is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). Let me check: the melting point of sodium bicarbonate is about 270°C, which is way higher than 4°C. Hmm, no. Or perhaps sodium carbonate? Its melting point is around 854°C. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of substances that melt around 4°C. Maybe something like ice? No, ice is solid water, melting at 0°C. Alternatively, maybe something like a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 58°C, which is higher. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Maybe the precipitate G is something that, when heated, gives off a gas and leaves behind B. Let me think of a decomposition reaction.

For example, if G is calcium carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CaO, which has a melting point of around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate of a different metal. Let me think, say sodium carbonate. If heated, it doesn't decompose at room temperature but maybe at higher temps. Wait, perhaps the precipitate is something else.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G is perhaps a sulfide. If Y is a sulfide, and X is an acid, then the reaction could produce H2S gas. But earlier we thought W was CO2, which doesn't line up with H2S. Hmm.

Alternatively, if W is CO2, perhaps G is a carbonate. Let me think: suppose X is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), Y is a carbonate like CaCO3. Then, the reaction would be H2SO4 + CaCO3 → CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O. So the precipitate would be CaSO4? Wait, but CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, so it might precipitate. Alternatively, if Y is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3, and X is H2SO4, then the reaction is H2SO4 + Na2CO3 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so perhaps G is not precipitating. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is between X and Y (metal) to produce a salt and hydrogen gas. But then W would be H2. But earlier, I thought W's protons and neutrons are equal, which H2 doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Let me try to think of another approach. The product of a keto acid with X has 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When it reacts with X, the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent. Or maybe it's a base?

Wait, if X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, then the reaction would produce sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has a formula of CH3COONa. Let me count the oxygens: CH3COO- has two O in the acetate group plus the O from the OH in water? No, wait, in the product (sodium acetate), there are two O in the COO- group. So maybe that's where the two O atoms come from. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Back to the reaction. Let me think about the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W, G. Let's say Y is a metal. X could be an acid. Or perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about the element in X that has a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X contains an element with multiple isotopes, like chlorine. For example, if X is Cl2 (chlorine gas), then the heavier isotope would be Cl-37 instead of Cl-35.

Chlorine is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, like in substitution reactions. So X could be Cl2. Let me see how that fits into the problem.

If X is Cl2, and Y is a metal, say zinc. Then the reaction could be Zn + Cl2 → ZnCl2, but that's a combustion reaction, producing Cl2 gas? No, wait, that's a synthesis reaction. Wait, if Cl2 reacts with a metal, it could produce a chloride and maybe release HCl gas? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, Cl2 doesn't react with carbonates directly unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. Wait, Cl2 + water → HClO, HCl, and O2. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the gas W. If W is CO2, then the reaction must produce CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But earlier that didn't fit because if X is a carbonate, Y would be an acid, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, X could be a bicarbonate.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4. Then, X (carbonate) would react with Y (acid) to produce CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate.

But then, what's the precipitate G? For example, if Y is H2SO4 and X is CaCO3 (which is a carbonate), then the reaction would be CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O. CaSO4 is only slightly soluble in water, so it would precipitate as G. Then, when G is heated, what happens? CaSO4 doesn't decompose upon heating, I think. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, if X is a different carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, reaction with H2SO4 would give Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal. Let's say X is a carbonate, and Y is a metal. For example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with a metal like Fe. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid, but that would make Y the carbonate, which doesn't fit the earlier points.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes. Let's say G is something like NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). When heated, NaHCO3 decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B could be Na2CO3. But what's the melting point of Na2CO3? It's about 854°C, way above 277 K (which is ~4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfite, which upon heating decomposes. For example, heating CaSO3·2H2O might release SO3 or something else. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point near that? Well, ice melts at 0°C, but maybe something else. Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 170°C. Hmm. Maybe it's something like a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 58°C. Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps B is something like a hydrated salt that melts at a lower temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that's about 800°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium carbonate decahydrate? No, that melts at higher temps too. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound entirely. Let me think of a reaction where G is a carbonate, and when heated, it releases CO2 and leaves behind a solid with a lower melting point.

Wait, what about if G is a metal carbonate that decomposes upon heating. For example, magnesium carbonate. MgCO3. When heated, it decomposes into MgO and CO2. The melting point of MgO is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 4°C. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly an acid or a halogen.

- X has a heavier isotope, perhaps Cl-37.

- Gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule, so like CO2.

- Reaction between X and Y (liquid) produces W, and a precipitate G.

- Heating G gives B, which has a melting point near 4°C.

Hmm. Let me think about the reaction again.

If X is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and Y is sodium carbonate (maybe in a different form, like as a liquid?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Y could be a carbonate solution.

Wait, another angle: What if Y is sodium sulfite, and X is H2SO4? Then the reaction would produce H2O, SO2, and sodium sulfate. But SO2 has 32 protons and 32 neutrons (S has 16 protons and 16-18 neutrons? Wait, S-32 is 16 protons and 16 neutrons. SO2 has 2 S atoms? No, wait, SO2 is one S, so 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the molecule has 32 protons and 32 neutrons. So that fits the W condition. But then the precipitate would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm, no precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. Let's say Y is ZnS, and X is HCl. Then, HCl + ZnS → ZnCl2 + H2S↑. H2S has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 2 S (32 protons each, 32 neutrons each in S-32). So for H2S molecule: protons = 2 + 32 = 34; neutrons = 0 + 32 = 32. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Another approach: Maybe W is something else. Let's think of other molecules where the total protons equal total neutrons.

Another possibility is O2. O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each O atom, so total 32 each. That fits.

If W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2. So perhaps X is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and Y is something else. But H2O2 is a liquid, so if X is H2O2, and Y is a catalyst, perhaps? Not sure.

Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. H2O2 is used as an oxidizing agent in organic reactions, so that's possible.

If X is H2O2 (liquid), then Y could be a metal, say, K. Wait, but K is a solid. Alternatively, Y could be another liquid. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2O2, and Y is a metal like iron. Then, H2O2 would decompose into H2O and O2. So the reaction would be 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. So W is O2.

If that's the case, then the precipitate G would be... Wait, in this reaction, there's no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, X could be KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent in organic chemistry. Then, Y could be a reducing agent, like FeSO4, leading to the release of O2 gas. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe Y is ethanol, and X is a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4. Then, the reaction could produce CO2 if it's a complete oxidation, but that's speculative.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me focus on the possible elements in X.

X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, the element could be chlorine (Cl), which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. Bromine (Br) has isotopes, but less commonly used perhaps. Iodine (I) has isotopes as well.

If X is Cl2, then it's a diatomic molecule. Cl has atomic number 17, so each Cl atom has 17 protons. Cl-35 has 18 neutrons (17+18=35), Cl-37 has 20 neutrons.

So, the cumulative atomic masses would be for Cl's lightest (Cl-35) and heaviest (Cl-37) isotopes. Wait, but the question says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes present in X. So if X has multiple Cl atoms, we have to sum all isotopes.

Wait, but the problem says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So perhaps X contains more than one element. Oh wait, no, wait the wording: "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So X is a compound containing multiple elements, and we need to find the lightest and heaviest elements in its composition, then sum their atomic masses.

Wait, that's a different approach. So, for example, if X is KClO3, then the elements are K, Cl, O. The lightest is K (39), heaviest is Cl (35.5?), wait no, K is lighter than Cl. Wait, K is atomic number 19, Cl 17. Wait no, K is higher atomic number, but in terms of atomic mass, K is about 39, Cl is about 35.5. So K is heavier than Cl. So the lightest element in KClO3 is Cl (35.5), heaviest is K (39) and O (16). So lightest is O, heaviest is K? Wait, O is 16, which is lighter than Cl (35.5). So in KClO3, the elements are K (39), Cl (35.5), O (16). So the lightest element is O, heaviest is K.

But I'm not sure if X is KClO3. Alternatively, if X is HCl, then the elements are H and Cl. H has atomic mass ~1, Cl ~35.5. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum would be 1 +35.5=36.5, which is close to option A (35) or C (31). Hmm, but options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, but the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So for each element in X, add their atomic masses, regardless of how many atoms. So if X has two elements, say H and Cl, sum 1 and 35.5 → 36.5. The options have 35 and 25, etc. So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another example: if X is CCl4, then elements are C and Cl. C has atomic mass ~12, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 12 +35.5=47.5, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is H2SO4. Then elements are H, S, O. H (1), S (32), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is S (32). Sum is 1+32=33. Not an option. Closest is option C (31, D 29?) Not exactly.

Wait, another possibility: X is HNO3. Elements H (1), N (14), O (16). Lightest is H, heaviest is O. Sum 1 +16=17. Not matching the options.

Hmm. Let's think about the product of a keto acid with X. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, perhaps the product is something like an ester or a substituted acid. Let me think: if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two ketone groups), and X is something that adds an oxygen. Wait, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a diol, or something with two O atoms. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, if the keto acid is reacting with X to form something like a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Let me circle back to the initial reaction. If X is HCl (hydrochloric acid), which is a liquid. It reacts with a metal (Y) to produce HCl gas (but that would require a higher temperature, maybe?), but then W would be HCl. HCl has 1 H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 Cl (17 protons, 18 neutrons in Cl-35). So total protons: 18 (Cl) +1 (H) =19. Total neutrons: 18 (Cl) +0 (H) =18. 19≠18. Doesn't fit.

Wait, but if W is CO2, then perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. Let's think of a reaction where X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. For example, X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate, a solid, but question says Y is a liquid. Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, but then X would be the acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. So, for example, X is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) which reacts with H2SO4 (Y) to produce CO2, water, and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal carbonate solution, and X is an acid. For instance, X is H2SO4 (liquid), Y is a carbonate solution. But again, the precipitate would be the sulfate, which may not precipitate unless the metal's sulfate is insoluble.

Another possibility: If Y is a metal sulfide, and X is H2SO4. Then, the reaction would be H2SO4 + CuS → CuSO4 + H2S↑. But H2S doesn't fit the W condition, as discussed earlier.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfate. For example, if Y is BaCO3 (a carbonate), and X is H2SO4. Then, BaCO3 + H2SO4 → BaSO4↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. BaSO4 is a precipitate. So W is CO2, G is BaSO4. Then, heating BaSO4 would do nothing, as it's stable. So B would be BaSO4, which has a high melting point. Doesn't fit the 277 K melting point.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. For instance, X is HNO3 (liquid), Y is CaCO3. Reaction: HNO3 + CaCO3 → Ca(NO3)2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But Ca(NO3)2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an oxide. For example, X is H2SO4 reacting with a metal oxide, producing water and a sulfate. But that doesn't produce a precipitate either if the metal's sulfate is soluble.

Wait, maybe Y is a sulfite. X is H2SO4 (acid) and Y is a sulfite like Na2SO3. Reaction: H2SO4 + Na2SO3 → Na2SO4 + H2O + SO2↑. So W is SO2. SO2 has 32 protons (S:16, O:16*2=32) and 32 neutrons (S:16, O:16 each). So for SO2, protons: 32, neutrons: 32. That fits.

So, W is SO2. Now, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. So no precipitation. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate of a metal whose sulfate is insoluble. For example, if Y is BaCO3 and X is H2SO4. Then reaction is BaCO3 + H2SO4 → BaSO4↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. BaSO4 is a precipitate. So G is BaSO4. Then, heating BaSO4 doesn't change it, so B is BaSO4. But BaSO4 has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit the 277 K clue.

Alternatively, perhaps G is something else. Let me think, what if G is a hydroxide? For example, perhaps the reaction produces a metal hydroxide that precipitates.

Wait, another approach: What if X is a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and Y is a ketone? No, that doesn’t seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base reacting with a carboxylic acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something like ethanol, but that's not a reagent in the same way. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, but that may not fit with the heavier isotope and being a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product of a keto acid with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, for example, the keto acid could be reacting to form an ester, which has more oxygen.

Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. If X is a base, like NaOH, the reaction would produce the sodium salt: CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

But the product in that case has more O's than 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a reducing agent, maybe it reduces the keto acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the keto acid reacts with X to form a diketone. But that's unclear.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the most probable elements in X.

If X is a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps it's concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Let's see if that fits.

H2SO4 is a liquid, reacts with metals to produce H2 gas. But earlier, H2 doesn't fit the W condition because W's protons and neutrons must be equal. So that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe when H2SO4 reacts with a carbonate, it produces CO2, which fits W.

So, let's say X is H2SO4 (liquid), Y is CaCO3 (solid). The reaction is H2SO4 + CaCO3 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. G is CaSO4, which is a precipitate. Then, heating CaSO4 doesn't do much, so B is CaSO4. But CaSO4's melting point is high, around 1450°C. Doesn't match 277 K.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is H2SO4. Let's say X is Na2CO3 (liquid?), but that's not usual. If they react, produces CO2, Na2SO4 (soluble), so no precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a sulfite, and X is H2SO4. Reaction produces SO2 gas, which fits W. Let's say Y is Na2SO3. Then, reaction is H2SO4 + Na2SO3 → Na2SO4 + SO2↑ + H2O. G is Na2SO4, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a halogen, like Cl2. Cl2 is used in organic chemistry, such as in substitution reactions. Let's say Y is a hydrocarbon. But then, the reaction may produce HCl gas. HCl molecule: 1 H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 Cl (17 protons, 18 neutrons in Cl-35). So total protons: 18 (Cl) +1 (H) =19. Neutrons: 18 (Cl) +0 (H) =18. 19≠18. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces Cl2 gas, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: if X is KMnO4 (a strong oxidizing agent), which is a dark purple solid. But in the reaction, maybe it's dissolved in an acid, making it a liquid? Or maybe Y is a liquid, like H2SO4.

Reaction of KMnO4 with a reducing agent might produce O2 gas. Let me think: KMnO4 + H2SO4 (concentrated) → MnSO4 + K2SO4 + O2↑ + H2O. So W is O2. O2 has 16*2=32 protons (each O has 8, so 2 O's make 16 → wait, wait: O has 8 protons each. So O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons per O: 8 in O-16. So total neutrons: 16. So W's protons and neutrons are 16 each. That fits. So W is O2.

Then, the reaction between KMnO4 (X) and H2SO4 (Y) produces O2 gas, a precipitate G (MnSO4 is soluble, K2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. So G isn't formed. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydrochloric acid (HCl), and Y is a carbonate. Then, reaction produces CO2 gas. But as before, the precipitate would be the corresponding chloride, which may or may not precipitate.

But earlier, the problem with HCl is that W would be HCl, which doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should look at the answer options to see which could fit.

Options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

If the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses is one of these numbers, let's think.

If X contains two elements, say H and Cl: sum is 1 +35.5=36.5 → closest is option A (35).

Alternatively, if X contains O and S: O is 16, S is 32. Sum 48. Not an option.

If X contains C and O: 12 +16=28. Closest is D)29.

Alternatively, if X contains N and O: 14 +16=30. Closest is C)31.

Wait, another possibility: if X is H2O2. Then, elements are H and O. H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17. Not matching.

Alternatively, if X is CCl4. Then, C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum 47.5. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 O atoms. So maybe X is a base with one O. For example, NaOH (Na, O, H). The product would be the conjugate base, which has more O's, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a liquid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitro compound. Hmm.

Another thought: If X is a metal, then it's probably not a liquid. But some metals are liquid at room temp, like mercury. But mercury isn't used much in organic reactions as a reagent.

Wait, let me think of the possible elements again. If X is Cl (chlorine gas), the heavier isotope is Cl-37. So the elements present are Cl. But Cl is a single element, so lightest and heaviest are same. So sum would be 35.5 +35.5=71, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, one light and one heavy. For example, if X is KCl, then K has atomic mass ~39, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 39 +35.5=74.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound with elements like O and S. For example, SO3. Then O is 16, S 32. Sum 16 +32=48, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like C and O. For example, CO2. Then C is 12, O 16. Sum 28. Closest option is D)29.

Alternatively, maybe X contains C and O, and another element. Not sure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like N and O. For example, NO2. N is 14, O 16. Sum 14 +16=30. Closest option is C)31.

Alternatively, if X is NO, then N (14) and O (16). Sum 30. Again, option C is 31.

Wait, but the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X has elements A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, sum A + B.

Looking at options:

A)35 → maybe 16 +19 (O + F?), but F is 19.

B)25 → 1 +24 (H + Mg) → sum 25.

C)31 → 15+16=31 (but 15 is P). Or 12 (C) +19 (F) → 31? No, 12+19=31. So C and F.

D)29 → 14 (N) +15 (O?) → 29? No, 14+15=29? 14+15=29? 14+15 is 29. So N and O.

Wait, but which combinations make sense for X being a reagent in organic chemistry.

If X is something like CH3F (fluoromethane), but that's not a common reagent. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like HNO3 (nitric acid), which is a reagent. Then, elements are H, N, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like ClO2. Then elements Cl and O. Cl is ~35.5, O 16. Sum is 51.5. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like Na and Cl. Na is ~23, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 58.5. No matching option.

Wait, think of another approach: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. So the product has 2 O's. Therefore, the reaction between X and the keto acid adds only one O atom (since the keto acid probably has more O's).

Wait, a keto acid like acetoacetic acid has four O's. If the product has two O's, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, removing water. Hmm, not sure.

If X is PCl5, which is used as a reagent. PCl5 reacts with carboxylic acids to form acid chlorides. Let's see: the product would be the acid chloride. For example, RCOOH + PCl5 → RCOCl + POCl3 + HCl↑. The acid chloride has Cl instead of OH. So the number of O's: RCOCl has two O's (from COCl). So the product has two O's. That fits.

So, if the keto acid reacts with X (PCl5), the product has two O's (in COCl). That fits the clue.

So, if X is PCl5, then the elements in X are P and Cl. P has atomic mass ~31, Cl ~35.5. Sum 31 +35.5=66.5. None of the options are close to that.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, X could be H2SO4 (sulfuric acid). It's a liquid, used as a reagent, and reacts with keto acids to form sulfonates or something else. But I'm not sure about the product's O count.

Wait, another angle: the product has 2 O atoms. So perhaps X is a base, and the product is an ester or something with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonyl compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorinating agent, like Cl2, which reacts with the keto acid to form an acyl chloride. Then, the product would have Cl and O. For example, RCOOH + Cl2 → RCOCl + HCl. RCOCl has two O's (in COCl). So that fits.

So if X is Cl2, the reaction would produce HCl and RCOCl. So W is HCl. But earlier, HCl doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition. So that's a problem.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake earlier in considering W. Let me reevaluate. If W is CO2, which fits the protons and neutrons condition (32 each), then in that scenario, X and Y must produce CO2.

So, X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. Reaction produces CO2, Na2SO4, and H2O. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a carbonate of a metal whose sulfate is insoluble. For example, BaCO3 and H2SO4. The reaction produces BaSO4 precipitate, CO2 gas.

So, X is H2SO4 (liquid), Y is BaCO3 (solid). Reaction: H2SO4 + BaCO3 → BaSO4↓ + CO2↑ + H2O.

Then, G is BaSO4. Heating BaSO4 doesn't change it, so B is BaSO4. But BaSO4's melting point is very high, so that doesn't fit the 277 K clue.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is not BaSO4 but something else. Maybe upon heating G, some decomposition occurs. Let me think, what if G is not BaSO4 but another sulfate.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound. Wait, maybe when X is H2SO4 and Y is a carbonate, the precipitate is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces a different precipitate. Maybe if Y is not a carbonate but a hydroxide.

Wait, if Y is Fe(OH)3, and X is H2SO4. Then, reaction is Fe(OH)3 + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + 3 H2O. No gas produced, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

Given that W must be a molecule where protons = neutrons, and X is a reagent in organic chemistry, X could be concentrated H2SO4.

In that case, X is H2SO4, so the elements present are H, S, and O.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is S (32.07). Sum is 1 +32.07=33.07.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 31 or D)29. But 33 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. If X is HNO3, which is a reagent. The elements are H, N, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, not in options.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound like NaOH. Elements Na, O, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Closest is option B)25. But 24 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements C and O. For example, CO2. Then, sum is 12 +16=28. Closest option is D)29. But not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are N and O. Like NO. Sum 14+16=30. Closest option is C)31.

Another thought: perhaps X is a compound like CH3Cl. Elements C, H, Cl. Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 1+35.5=36.5. Closest option A)35.

But CH3Cl is chloromethane, used as a solvent but not a reagent per se.

Wait, another angle: if X is a compound with two elements, and the sum is 35. Let's see: 35 could be 16 (O) +19 (F) =35. So X contains F and O. For example, O and F in a compound. But what compound is that? OF2 is possible, but I'm not sure if it's a common reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is ClF3. Cl is ~35.5, F is ~19. Sum 54.5. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is KClO3. Elements K, Cl, O. Lightest O (16), heaviest K (39). Sum 55. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like Mg and O. MgO. Sum 24 (Mg) +16 (O)=40. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with elements like C and H. For example, C2H5OH (ethanol). Sum 12 +1=13. Not an option.

Hmm.

I think I'm going around in circles. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)31. Let me think why.

If X is a compound with elements like S (32) and O (16). Sum would be 48, which isn't an option. Alternatively, if X contains elements like N (14) and O (16). Sum is 30, which is close to option C)31.

Another approach: the melting point of B is 277 K (~4°C). What substance has a melting point near that? Perhaps ammonium nitrate? Wait, it's about 170°C. Hmm. Another thought: perhaps B is a hydrated salt. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 58°C. Still higher than 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe something like a carbonate which decomposes upon heating to give a lower melting point. But I'm not finding a fit.

Wait, another thought: if B is a hydrate, maybe something like magnesium nitrate tetrahydrate, which has a lower melting point. I'm not certain.

Perhaps I should focus on the initial part and make an educated guess based on the options.

If the cumulative sum is 31, which is option C, perhaps the elements are N (14) and O (16)—sum 30. But not 31. Alternatively, maybe it's C (12) and F (19) → sum 31.

Given that, perhaps X contains C and F, like in a chlorinating agent. For example, X could be CF3Cl or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound with elements C and O. Sum 28, option D is 29. Close.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me summarize:

The key points are:

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry → possible H2SO4, HNO3, Cl2, etc.

- X contains a heavier isotope → likely Cl-37 or another isotope.

- Gas W has equal protons and neutrons → CO2, O2, SO2, etc.

- Precipitate G, when heated, gives B with mp ~4°C.

- Product of keto acid and X has 2 O atoms.

Assuming X is H2SO4:

Elements in X: H, S, O.

Sum of lightest (H:1) and heaviest (S:32) is 33, not an option.

Assuming X is Cl2:

Elements in X: Cl. So lightest and heaviest same. Sum would be ~35.5*2=71, not an option.

Assuming X is HNO3:

Elements H, N, O. Sum 1 +16=17. Not an option.

Assuming X is CCl4:

Elements C and Cl. Sum 12 +35.5=47.5. Not an option.

Assuming X is CH3COOH (acetic acid):

Elements C, H, O. Sum 12 +16=28. Close to option D)29.

But not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is for the two lightest and heaviest elements in X when considering all isotopes. Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps if X is Cl2, which only has Cl. So the lightest and heaviest are same. The sum would be 35.5 (for Cl) + 35.5 (for Cl) =71, which isn't an option. But 35 is an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses, not considering isotopes. So for Cl, atomic mass is ~35.5. So 35.5 +35.5=71.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, regardless of quantity. For example, if X is Cl2, the only element is Cl, so sum is 35.5.

But 35.5 isn't an option, but option A is 35. Close.

Another angle: the question might have a typo, and the correct sum is 35, which would correspond to Cl's atomic mass (35.5 rounded down to 35). So option A.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KClO3. Elements K, Cl, O. Sum of lightest (O:16) and heaviest (K:39) is 55, not an option.

Hmm.

Another thought: if the product of the keto acid and X has 2 O atoms, perhaps X is something that adds an O. Like O2. But O2 is a gas, not a reagent in the same way.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, which would deprotonate the keto acid, forming a salt. The salt would have more O's. For example, the keto acid (RCOOR') would become RCOO^- Na^+.

But the product's O count would depend on the structure. Not sure.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is A)35, assuming X contains Cl and the sum is 35 (from Cl's atomic mass).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and compound B. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C), and the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (32 protons, 32 neutrons) or O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons). This suggests the reaction between X and Y produces CO₂ or O₂.

2. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry, which narrows it to compounds like H₂SO₄, HNO₃, Cl₂, or PCl₅. X also incorporates a heavier isotope, indicating it contains an element with isotopes (e.g., Cl-35 and Cl-37).

3. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of ~277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a hydrated salt or a compound that decomposes upon heating.

4. **Product with Keto Acid**: The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X may act as a dehydrating agent or a chlorinating agent, such as PCl₅ or Cl₂.

5. **Atomic Masses**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated. If X contains multiple elements, their atomic masses are summed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (35)**: This corresponds to the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl), which has isotopes (e.g., Cl-35 and Cl-37). If X is Cl₂, the lightest and heaviest elements are the same (Cl), and the sum of their atomic masses is approximately 35.5. Rounded down, this matches option A.
  
- **Option B (25)**: This could correspond to elements like H (1) and Mg (24), but X is unlikely to contain both. This option does not fit the clues.

- **Option C (31)**: This could correspond to elements like C (12) and F (19), but there is no clear evidence that X contains these elements. This option is less likely.

- **Option D (29)**: This could correspond to elements like N (14) and O (15), but there is no clear evidence that X contains these elements. This option is also less likely.

### Conclusion:
Given the clues and the analysis, the most plausible scenario is that X contains chlorine (Cl), which has an atomic mass of approximately 35.5. Rounded down, this matches option A (35). 

**Answer: A**
