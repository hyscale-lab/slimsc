Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think blue refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex, possibly. So the dithiocyanato would be Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Stability constants, β, are log values, right? Or are they the actual formation constants? Oh, right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable it is.

The complexes would form in the following way:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN²+ (β1 =9)
CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40)
Co(SCN)₂²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₃³+ (β3=63)
Co(SCN)₃³+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄^4+ (β4=16)

Wait, wait, the β values are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β is for the step of adding one SCN- ion. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

So for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), the formation constant K_n is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, no. Actually, for each step, the stability constant is defined as:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] / ([Co^(2-n)] [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Each β represents the constant for adding another SCN- to the complex. So, for the first step:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN²+ → β1 = [CoSCN²+]/([Co²+][SCN⁻])

For the second step:

CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+ → β2 = [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([CoSCN²+][SCN⁻])

So the overall formation constant for the Co(SCN)_2²+ complex is β1 * β2.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3³+, it's β1*β2*β3, and for Co(SCN)_4^4+, β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but here β4 is 16. So the fourth complex is Co(SCN)_4^4+ with K=β1*β2*β3*β4 =9*40*63*16.

But in the problem, I think we're supposed to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2²+.

But the question is about all cobalt-containing species. So we need to consider all four possible complexes: Co²+, CoSCN²+, Co(SCN)₂²+, Co(SCN)3^3+, and Co(SCN)4^4+. Wait, but maybe only up to the third? Or do all four complexes form?

Wait, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4, so all four complexes are possible. But wait, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions. Oh, but the complexes can have different charges. Hmm, but the problem is about all cobalt species, so all possible complexes are considered.

The task is to find the mole fraction of Co(SCN)_2²+ among all the Co species.

To calculate this, we can model the distribution of Co across all possible complexes.

But wait, the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

Let me think: the formation of each complex depends on the concentration of SCN- and the stability constants.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them to get the percentage of dithiocyanato.

But this seems a bit involved. Let me outline the steps.

1. Write the expressions for each complex's concentration in terms of the others.
2. Use the stability constants to find the ratios of the concentrations.
3. Assume that the total concentration of all complexes equals the initial Co²+ concentration.
4. Solve for the mole fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the cumulative stability constants.

Let’s think about the distribution of Co²+ and its complexes.

The general approach is to model each possible species:

Species: [Co²+], [CoSCN²+], [Co(SCN)₂²+], [Co(SCN)3³+], [Co(SCN)4^4+}

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions, so the initial Co is Co²+. So the complexes would have higher charges as more SCN- is added.

But the solution also contains SCN- at 0.1 M, which is quite a high concentration.

Wait, the process of complex formation goes from Co²+ to higher complexes (n=1,2,3,4). So the first complex is CoSCN²+, the second Co(SCN)₂²+ (charge 2+), third Co(SCN)3^3+ (charge +3), and the fourth Co(SCN)4^4+ (charge +4).

Wait, but in such a high SCN- concentration (0.1 M), the higher complexes are more likely to form, right?

But each β is a step-wise constant. So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So the formation constants K1, K2, K3, K4 are:

K1 = β1 =9

K2= β1*β2=9*40=360

K3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680

K4= β1*β2*β3*β4= 9*40*63*16= 362880

Wait, but K4 is 362880, which is very large, so the fourth complex is very stable. However, the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, so K2=360.

But in the presence of excess SCN- (0.1 M), the higher complexes will be favored. So we need to calculate the fraction of each complex.

But perhaps we can model the problem using the following approach:

The fraction of each complex is determined by the cumulative formation constants and the concentration of SCN-.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the fraction of each species.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} K_i [SCN^-]^i )

Wait, wait, not exactly. Let me think.

The general approach for a metal M forming complexes up to Mn is:

For each species, the fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [M][SCN-]^n) divided by the sum over all possible species.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the expressions.

Let’s denote the concentration of Co²+ as [M], and [SCN^-] as s.

The concentration of each complex is:

[ML]^n = [M] * s^n * K_n

Where K_n is the formation constant for the nth complex.

So the concentrations are:

[Co²+] = [M] (uncomplexed)
[CoSCN²+] = [M] * s * K1
[Co(SCN)₂²+] = [M] * s² * K2
[Co(SCN)3³+] = [M] * s^3 * K3
[Co(SCN)4^4+] = [M] * s^4 * K4

Wait, but wait, K2 is β1*β2, right? So each K_n is the product up to βn.

So the total concentration of cobalt is [M] + [ML] + [ML2] + [ML3] + [ML4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So:

[M] + [M] s K1 + [M] s² K2 + [M] s^3 K3 + [M] s^4 K4 = 1e-2.

Let me factor out [M]:

[M] (1 + s K1 + s² K2 + s^3 K3 + s^4 K4) = c(Co) = 1e-2.

So [M] = c(Co) / (1 + s K1 + s^2 K2 + s^3 K3 + s^4 K4).

Once we have [M], we can compute the concentration of each complex.

But since we are interested in the mole fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+, which is [Co(SCN)₂²+] / ([Co²+] + [CoSCN²+] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)3³+] + [Co(SCN)4^4+} ), we can compute it as ([M] s^2 K2) / (c(Co)).

Wait, because the denominator is just c(Co), since sum of all complexes is c(Co).

So the fraction f2 is:

f2 = ([M] s² K2) / c(Co).

And since [M] = c(Co) / D, where D is the denominator (1 + s K1 + s² K2 + s^3 K3 + s^4 K4), then:

f2 = ( c(Co) / D * s² K2 ) / c(Co) ) = (s² K2 ) / D.

Similarly, the fraction for each species is (s^n K_n ) / D for n=0 to 4.

Wait, for n=0, it's [M] = [M] = (c(Co)/D) * 1 = (c(Co) s^0 K0) / D, but K0 is 1.

So, the general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (s^n K_n) / D, where K0=1.

So our denominator D is sum_{n=0 to 4} s^n K_n.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again.

Because for each complex, the term is s^n K_n.

So for n=0, it's s^0 K0=1.

n=1: s K1

n=2: s^2 K2

and so on.

So D is 1 + s K1 + s² K2 + s³ K3 + s^4 K4.

Yes, that makes sense.

So for each term, (s^n K_n) is the numerator for that species, and D is the denominator.

So the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is (s² K2) / D.

So let's compute each term.

Given:

s = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

K1 = β1 =9.

K2= β1β2=9*40=360.

K3= β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680.

K4= β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

So let's compute each term:

n=0: s^0 * K0 =1*1=1.

n=1: s^1 * K1=0.1 *9=0.9.

n=2: s^2 * K2= (0.1)^2 *360 = 0.01 *360=3.6.

n=3: s^3 * K3= (0.1)^3 *22680 = 0.001 *22680=22.68.

n=4: s^4 * K4= (0.1)^4 *362880= 0.0001 *362880=36.288.

Now, sum all these terms to get D.

Let me compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.9 → sum so far is 1.9.

n=2: 3.6 → sum 5.5.

n=3:22.68 → sum 28.18.

n=4:36.288 → sum 64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 / 64.468.

Let me compute that.

3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Wait, that's about 5.556%.

Wait, but wait, that's much lower than any of the options. Hmm. The options are all around 16% to 42%.

Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the K values again.

Wait, K1=9, K2=9*40=360, K3=9*40*63=22680, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, 22680 *16= 362880. Correct.

s=0.1 M.

So n=2 term: s² K2= (0.1)^2 *360=0.01 *360=3.6.

n=3: s³ K3=0.1^3 *22680= 0.001 *22680=22.68.

n=4: s^4 K4=0.0001 *362880=36.288.

Wait, but in the calculation of D, the sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =1+0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468. Correct.

So 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05556 →5.556%.

But the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. None of these is about 5.5%.

Wait, did I miss something? Maybe I mixed up the definition of K and β.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given as sequential β values, but perhaps the overall K for each complex isn't the product up to that step. Oh wait, no, that's the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the D.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1 →1.

n=1: 0.1 *9=0.9 → sum 1.9.

n=2: 0.01 *360=3.6 → sum 5.5.

n=3: 0.001 *22680=22.68 → sum 28.18.

n=4:0.0001 *362880=36.288 → sum 64.468. Correct.

Hmm, so the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈5.56%.

But none of the options are near that. So what's wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the K values.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the β values are given in the order of the complexes, but the complexes are CoSCN, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, Co(SCN)₄.

But perhaps the β's are the cumulative constants, not the step-wise.

Wait, no, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Stability constants can be defined as either overall or step-wise.

If they are overall, then each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

But the way the problem presents them, it's more likely that β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc. So each β is the step-wise constant.

So, the approach I took is correct.

But the calculated percentage is about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, but maybe the dithiocyanato is the third complex, but no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the blue color, which might correspond to a different complex.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the ratio of dithiocyanato (n=2) to all the complexes except free Co²+.

Wait, but the question says "among all cobalt containing species", which includes all of them.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the values somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but I didn't consider that the higher complexes may not form as much because of the lower β for the fourth step.

Wait, but in the calculation, the denominator D is 64.468, and the terms for n=3 and n=4 are 22.68 and 36.288, which are the largest terms. So the majority is in n=4.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is n=2.

So 5.5% is not among the options. Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the stability constants are given as overall constants, not step-wise.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me try that.

If each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex, then K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but that can't be right because the stability constants should increase with n if the complexes are more stable. But here K4=16 is lower than K3=63.

Wait, perhaps the given βs are the step-wise constants, but in a different order.

Wait, maybe the order is β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc., but perhaps in the problem, the β's are in a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are for the first four complexes, and the highest complex is the third one, n=3.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- ions. So n=2.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the percentage of the third complex, which is trithiocyanato. Let me check the options.

No, the question clearly says dithiocyanato, so n=2.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the K values.

Wait, K1=9, K2=9*40=360.

n=2 term: s^2 * K2 = 0.01 * 360 = 3.6.

n=3 term: s^3 * K3=0.001 *63=0.063? Wait, no. Wait, if K3 is 63. Oh wait, if K3=63, then:

Wait, if the given βs are the overall constants, not step-wise, then K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but that can't be, because each step should have a higher K than the previous.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the βs as step-wise, but the problem gives the overall K for each complex.

Wait, that would change everything.

Wait, the way the problem is stated:

"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, that might mean that the overall K for each complex is given. So:

K1=9 → CoSCN²+.

K2=40 → Co(SCN)₂²+.

K3=63 → Co(SCN)3³+.

K4=16 → Co(SCN)4^4+.

But then, K4=16 is lower than K3=63, which doesn't make sense because each successive complex should be more stable. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βs are the step-wise constants, but in a different order. Like β1 is for the second complex, etc.

Wait, perhaps the complexes are:

Co(SCN)₂²+ → β1=9.

Co(SCN)3³+ → β2=40.

Co(SCN)4^4+ → β3=63.

Wait, but then β4=16 would be for the fifth complex, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong K values.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that β1 is for the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So K2=9.

But then, the next complexes would have higher Ks.

Wait, but the problem states that the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach I took is correct, but the answer I got isn't among the options, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is about the sum of all species, including the free Co²+. So the fraction is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈5.56%, which is about 5.56% and not any of the options.

But options are 16.9%, which is D.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the K values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering only complexes up to n=3 and not n=4. Because β4=16 being lower than β3=63 might mean that the fourth complex isn't formed much.

Wait, but in my calculation, the fourth complex has a high K4=362880, which makes it a major component.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is the step-wise constant for the third complex. Maybe the given βs are in a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps the given βs are in the order of n=1 to n=4, so the first complex is K1=9, second is K2=40, third K3=63, fourth K4=16.

But that would make the fourth complex less stable than the third, which may not make sense, but perhaps it's possible.

In that case, K4=16 for n=4.

So, let's recalculate the terms with K4=16.

So, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

But wait, that would mean the fourth complex has a lower K than the third, which is possible, but it's not usual.

But let's proceed.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1.

n=1: s* K1=0.1 *9=0.9.

n=2: s² K2=0.01 *40=0.4.

n=3: s^3 K3=0.001 *63=0.063.

n=4: s^4 K4=0.0001 *16=0.0016.

Sum D=1+0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So D≈2.3646.

Fraction for n=2: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, which is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Ah, that's one of the options! So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and each βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

But wait, that would mean that the fourth complex has a K of 16, which is lower than the third, which is 63. That seems odd, but perhaps the data is correct.

So in this scenario, the fraction of n=2 is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constants provided are step-wise constants. For the nth complex, the overall formation constant \( K_n \) is the product of the step-wise constants up to \( \beta_n \):
   - \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \)
   - \( K_2 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 = 9 \cdot 40 = 360 \)
   - \( K_3 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 = 22680 \)
   - \( K_4 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 \cdot \beta_4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 = 362880 \)

2. **Distribution of Cobalt Species**:  
   The total concentration of cobalt is distributed among all species:
   \[
   [Co^{2+}] + [CoSCN^{2+}] + [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] + [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] + [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]
   The fraction of each species is proportional to \( s^n K_n \), where \( s = [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The denominator \( D \) is the sum of all terms:
   \[
   D = 1 + s K_1 + s^2 K_2 + s^3 K_3 + s^4 K_4.
   \]

3. **Calculation of Terms**:  
   Using \( s = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) and the \( K_n \) values:
   - \( n = 0 \): \( s^0 K_0 = 1 \)
   - \( n = 1 \): \( s^1 K_1 = 0.1 \cdot 9 = 0.9 \)
   - \( n = 2 \): \( s^2 K_2 = 0.01 \cdot 360 = 3.6 \)
   - \( n = 3 \): \( s^3 K_3 = 0.001 \cdot 22680 = 22.68 \)
   - \( n = 4 \): \( s^4 K_4 = 0.0001 \cdot 362880 = 36.288 \)

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468.
   \]

4. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex (n = 2)**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, \( f_2 \), is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{s^2 K_2}{D} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05556 \, \text{or} \, 5.56\%.
   \]

5. **Revisiting the Assumption**:  
   Since the calculated percentage (5.56%) does not match any of the provided options, we reconsider the interpretation of the stability constants. If the given \( \beta \) values are instead the overall constants for each complex (not step-wise), the calculations change:
   - \( K_1 = 9 \), \( K_2 = 40 \), \( K_3 = 63 \), \( K_4 = 16 \).

   Recomputing the terms:
   - \( n = 0 \): \( s^0 K_0 = 1 \)
   - \( n = 1 \): \( s^1 K_1 = 0.1 \cdot 9 = 0.9 \)
   - \( n = 2 \): \( s^2 K_2 = 0.01 \cdot 40 = 0.4 \)
   - \( n = 3 \): \( s^3 K_3 = 0.001 \cdot 63 = 0.063 \)
   - \( n = 4 \): \( s^4 K_4 = 0.0001 \cdot 16 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is now:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{s^2 K_2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
