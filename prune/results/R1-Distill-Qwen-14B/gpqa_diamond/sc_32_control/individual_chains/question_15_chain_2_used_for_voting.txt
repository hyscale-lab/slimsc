Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information. Let me break this down step by step. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like, so their radii are probably similar. But the host stars might have different radii, which would affect the transit probability. Oh, wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So the star size isn't a factor here because they're equal. So the main factors would be the orbital distance and the size of the planet relative to the star.

Transit probability formula, I think it's something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the relative size. Or perhaps the formula is the area of the planet compared to the star's disk. Oh wait, the probability is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, but I think that's not exactly right. Wait, no, I think transit probability isn't just that. Oh right, the transit probability also depends on the orbital inclination. Because the planet has to be edge-on for a transit to occur, and the probability of that is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Because the star's disk is a certain size, so the chance that the planet's path in front of the star is when the orbital plane is aligned.

Wait, I think the formula is the probability P ≈ (R_star / a) * (some factor), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because if the semi-major axis is larger, the probability of transit is lower because the orbital plane is less likely to align with our line of sight. So the probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis, assuming the same star size.

But wait, the star's radius is the same for both, so the probability is inversely proportional to a, the orbital radius. So the planet with a smaller a (closer to the star) would have a higher probability.

But wait, in the problem, the orbital periods are given. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So if P1 = P_2 / 3. Because Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a^3. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M_star + m_planet ≈ M_star. So P² ∝ a³/(M_star). 

So for Planet_1, P1 = P2 /3. So (P1)^2 = (P2)^2 /9 = (a1^3 / M1) * (4π²/G). Similarly for Planet_2, (P2)^2 = (a2^3)/M2 * (4π²/G). But M1 is twice M2. So let me write these equations:

P1² = (4π²/G M1) * a1³  
P2² = (4π²/G M2) * a2³  

Given that P1 = P2/3, so (P2/3)^2 = (4π²/G M1) a1³  
=> P2² /9 = (4π²/G M1) a1³  
But from Planet_2's equation: P2² = (4π²/G M2) a2³  
So substituting into the first equation:  
( (4π²/G M2 a2³) ) /9 = (4π²/G M1) a1³  
Simplify: (M2 a2³) /9 = M1 a1³  
So a2³ = (9 M1 / M2) a1³  
But M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.  
So a2³ = (9 * 2 M2 / M2) a1³ = 18 a1³  
So a2 = (18)^(1/3) a1 ≈ 2.6207 a1  
So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is about 2.62 times that of Planet_1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the transit probability. Since both stars have the same radius, R, the probability P ≈ (R / a) for each planet. So P1 = R / a1 and P2 = R / a2  
So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 2.6207  
So P1 is about 2.62 times higher than P2. Wait, but that can't be right because if a2 is larger, then R/a2 is smaller. So P1 is (R/a1) and P2 is (R/a2). Since a2 is larger (about 2.62 a1), R/a2 is smaller than R/a1. So P1 is higher than P2 by a factor of about 2.62.

But wait, the transit probability isn't exactly R/a. I think it's more like (R/a) multiplied by some function, maybe (R_planet / R_star), but in this case, since R_star is the same for both and R_planet is same (earth-like), that factor would be the same for both. So the main factor is (R/a).

So if a2 is larger, R/a2 is smaller, so P2 is smaller. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the ratio of probabilities would be P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) = a2/a1 ≈ 2.62. So P1 is about 2.62 times more probable to transit than P2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times. Hmm, wait, my calculation gave about 2.62 times, which is approximately 2.6 times. So option D says ~2.7 times. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me go through the steps again.

Given:  
P1 = (1/3) P2  
M1 = 2 M2  

Using Kepler's third law:  
P^2 = (4π²/(G M)) a^3  
So for each planet:  
P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³  
P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³  

Divide the two equations:  
(P1²)/(P2²) = (M2 a1³)/(M1 a2³)  
But P1 = P2/3, so (1/9) = (M2 a1³)/(2 M2 a2³)  
Simplify: 1/9 = (a1)/(2 a2³)  
Wait, no, let me do that again.

Wait, P1 squared is (P2/3)^2 = P2²/9. So:

P1² / P2² = (a1³ / M1) / (a2³ / M2)  
So (1/9) = (a1³ M2)/(a2³ M1)  
Substituting M1 = 2 M2:  
1/9 = (a1³ M2)/(a2³ * 2 M2)  
Simplify M2 cancels:  
1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³)  
So 2 a2³ = 9 a1³  
=> a2³ = (9/2) a1³  
=> a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) a1  
What's (9/2) to the power 1/3? Let's calculate:

9/2 =4.5  
The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.6506 (since 1.6^3 is 4.096, 1.65^3 is about 4.49, 1.6506^3 ≈4.5). So a2 ≈ 1.6506 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_1.

Wait, so a2 is larger than a1. So a1 is smaller. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

The probability P is proportional to (R/a). So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2.

So P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1.6506.

So about 1.65 times higher. So Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting.

So looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is not matching.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the transit probability isn't (R/a), but (R_planet + R_star) / (distance) or something else. Wait, no, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. That's dependent on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (some factor), but I think the main factor is R_star/a multiplied by the probability of the right alignment.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by the formula:  
P = (R_star / a) * ( (R_planet) / R_star ) ) * (something? )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star) ) = R_planet / a. But that can't be, because if a is large, the probability would go down, which makes sense. But wait, if both planets have the same radius, and same R_star, then P is inversely proportional to a. Since Planet_1 has a smaller a, P1 is larger.

So, P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2). So the ratio is (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Earlier, we found a2 ≈ 1.65 a1, so P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but I thought earlier when I messed up the calculation, I got a different result. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps I confused P1 and P2 in the earlier steps. Let me clarify: Planet_1 has a shorter period, which implies a smaller semi-major axis. So a1 is smaller than a2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is higher because a1 is smaller. So the ratio P1/P2 is a2/a1 which is 1.65.

So the correct option is C, which says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

But looking back at the options:

A) Planet_2: 2.25

B) Planet_2:1.5

C) Planet_1: 1.65

D) Planet_1: 2.7

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbital plane with our line of sight and the relative sizes of the planet and the star. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar, and the host stars have the same radii, the key factor is the orbital distance of the planet from its host star.

Using Kepler's third law, the relationship between the orbital period \( P \), the semi-major axis \( a \), and the mass of the host star \( M \) is given by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we know:
- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).
- The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).

Substituting these values into Kepler's law, we find the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

\[
\frac{(P_2/3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]

\[
2a_2^3 = 9a_1^3
\]

\[
a_2 = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} a_1 \approx 1.65a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet_2 is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_1 (\( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \)).

The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \)). Since both stars have the same radius, the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65.
- **D)** Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.
