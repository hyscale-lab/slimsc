Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And the key point is that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Oh, right! The wave function describes the probability amplitude of finding the particle at a certain position. But the question says that when they measured, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be non-zero only in that region. So what does that imply about the wave function outside this region?

Oh right, I remember that in such cases, the wave function must be zero outside the region where the particle can be found. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. But wait, the given wave function is expressed as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So let's see.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So for x<1 and x>3, the particle isn't found, meaning the wave function should be zero there. So when x is such that the wave function is zero, that would happen when the real and imaginary parts both are zero. But wait, the wave function is a complex number. So for the entire expression to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero.

Wait, but the wave function can't be zero everywhere outside the region because that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside the region. So when x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero.

Wait, but the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So for that to be zero, both the real part (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part (-0.5) must be zero. But wait, -0.5i is the imaginary part, which can't be zero. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the imaginary part is always -0.5, which is not zero. So that can't be the case. That suggests that perhaps the wave function is being normalized in such a way that it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The problem says that when you measure the position, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3. Therefore, the given wave function must be zero for x outside that region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for this to be zero, each component must be zero. That would require a/sqrt(1+x) = 0 (real part) and -0.5i = 0 (imaginary part), which is impossible because the imaginary part is fixed at -0.5i. So this suggests that perhaps the wave function as given is not the entire story, or maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the given expression is the wave function in that interval, and it's zero outside. But wait, the given wave function isn't zero outside because it's defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps the expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but then that would mean that the wave function is zero outside the interval. So perhaps the given wave function is only for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. So the entire wave function is defined piecewise. So for x between 1 and 3, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But that doesn't make sense for normalization because the wave function would have both real and imaginary parts, and the integral for normalization would be the integral of |ψ|^2.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to structure this. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, valid for x between 1 and 3. And ψ(x)=0 elsewhere. But wait, no, because when you have a square root in the denominator, 1+x must be positive, which it is for x>=1. But if ψ(x) is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then we can proceed.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: each system has a particle, and the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the position measurements found all particles in 1<x<3, which means that the wave function is zero outside. So perhaps in the given wave function, for x outside 1 to 3, ψ(x) is zero. So for x >=1 and x<=3, ψ(x) is as given, else zero.

But wait, the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, perhaps that's the expression for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But then, when you integrate the square of the magnitude, you have to consider only x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. So to normalize this, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and (-0.5) is the imaginary part. So the square of the modulus is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25).

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must be 1.

Wait, but that would be the integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both evaluated from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So the integral from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second, ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) )= 0.25*2=0.5.

So the entire integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a² ≈ 0.7213.

So a is the square root of that. sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. The given wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. So when we take the modulus squared, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. Which is a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we compute |ψ(x)|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (-0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. That's correct.

So the normalization integral is correct, and the solution gives a ≈0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions. The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are not found outside this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

   Thus, the first term becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

   \[
   0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
