Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let's take it step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or more likely, an ester group like R-O-CO-R'. Ester groups typically show a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl stretch. So that's a key point.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. But the number of aromatic signals can tell us. If it's para, there are two equivalent protons each set, so two signals. Wait, no—para substitution on benzene gives two equivalent sets of aromatic protons, each a doublet. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other. So each H on the ring is adjacent to one substituent. The coupling would lead to two sets of protons—each pair is equivalent. So in that case, you get two signals for the aromatic protons. But wait, no. Wait, in para, the protons are actually all equivalent if the substituents are the same. Wait, no, if two substituents are different, like two different groups, then the aromatic protons would be in two different environments.

Wait, the problem says the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So two substituents, which could be same or different. Let's say substituents A and B. Let's think about the possible substitution patterns.

If the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Each set would have two protons. Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 2 (ortho), then the aromatic protons would split into more signals.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of aromatic protons. The problem states that there are two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So, perhaps the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each with two H. But wait, benzene has six H. If two substituents, how? Wait, if substituents are para, then the two substituents are opposite each other. That would leave two pairs of equivalent H. Hmm, no. Wait, in para substitution, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. Then the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. Wait, no. If substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring symmetry would make positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 equivalent. So each of these pairs would have their own H signals. So that's two aromatic signals: each integrating to 2 H. Wait, but if there are substituents, each substituent is at 1 and 4, then the ring would have H at 2,3,5,6. So positions 2 and 6 are next to substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 are next to substituent 4. So in that case, each of those H would be split into different environments. So the H at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (same environment), and H at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. That gives two signals for aromatic H. So that fits the NMR description: two signals, each integrating to 2 H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene.

So the substituents are in the para positions. Now, what are these substituents?

The NMR also shows two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in a substituent such as an ester group. Wait, an ester is O-CO-O, but perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached as O-CO-R or R-O-CO-. Let's think about the ester group. If one substituent is an ester, perhaps as an -O-CO-R group.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the ester group. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if the benzene has an ester group as a substituent, that would be an alkoxy group attached to a carbonyl. Like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no. Ester is R-O-CO-R', so the substituent would be R-O-CO- attached to benzene.

Wait, but another substituent is present since it's di-substituted. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group, or something else. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that is itself more complex.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on a double bond. So perhaps the substituents include a vinyl group, like part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Let me think about what substituents on benzene would give vinyl protons. For example, a substituent could be an ethenyl group (-CH2-CH2-), but wait, that's single bonds. No, wait, vinyl is a double bond, so a substituent like -CH2-CH2- would have single bonds, but a substituent like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-... Hmm, maybe more likely, the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that includes a double bond.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached. Let me think. If the benzene ring has a substituent like -O-CO-R, and another substituent like -CH2-CH2- something, but that wouldn't have vinyl protons. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group that's part of a larger substituent, like a propenoate ester (like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-?), but that's not a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a styryl group, like the ester is connected via a double bond. Or perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Let's imagine substituent A is an ester group (like -O-CO-R), and substituent B is a vinyl group. So substituent B would be something like -CH2-CH2- but that's single bonds. Or substituent B could be an ethenyl group (-CH2-CH2-) but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, wait, vinyl would be a double bond. So substituent B could be a vinyl group, like -CH2-CH2- no, that's single bonds. Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2- but that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps substituent B is an ethenyl group, but that's CH2=CH-.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The vinyl protons would be in a substituent. So for a vinyl group (CH2=CH–), the protons are on the double bond. Each proton would couple with adjacent protons. So for a structure like CH2=CH–, the protons would be split into a doublet of doublets, or perhaps a doublet if it's a trans coupling. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is part of a substituent that causes a specific coupling pattern.

Wait, the problem states the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Let's consider each. The first vinyl signal is a doublet, which suggests that each proton is coupled to one other proton. For example, in a CH2=CH– group, each proton would be split into a doublet due to coupling with each other. But wait, in that case, each proton would be a doublet, so perhaps both would have the same shift and thus appear as a singlet? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent, like an ester where the ester is connected via a double bond.

Let me think about ester substituents. For example, the substituent could be an allyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aryl group attached via a double bond, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a double bond adjacent to the ester group.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group in the IR suggests that two oxygen atoms are present in the molecule, perhaps giving O2 in the formula. So the formula will have O2, which matches all options since all options have O2.

Looking at the options, the possible molecular formulas are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

Now, the NMR also says there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two sets of methyl groups. Each set would be a triplet, perhaps, but the exact splitting depends on their environment.

And there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups.

Wait, that's important. No CH2 groups. So all the carbons that would be CH2 in other structures must be either CH3 or perhaps in a different environment.

So let's think about possible substituents on the benzene ring. Since it's di-substituted, and the IR indicates an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a methyl group attached in some way.

Wait, but the substituents would be in the para positions, so perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a methyl group. But wait, a methyl group would give a singlet in the NMR, but the problem says there are two signals for –CH3 groups.

Wait, two different methyl groups. So maybe each substituent brings a methyl group. But wait, substituent A could be an ester group that includes a methyl, and substituent B could be a methyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. For example:

Substituent 1: -O-CO-OCH3 (a methyl ester). Wait, that would be an ester group with a methyl. So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3, but wait, that's not correct. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is methyl, then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3, which is incorrect. Wait, no, wait, actually, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, the ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is a phenyl group (from benzene), and R' is methyl, then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the structure is Ph-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, an ester is formed from an acid and an alcohol. For example, the ester would be Ph-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a methyl ester: O-CO-OCH3. But that would mean the benzene has an ester group O-CO-OCH3 as a substituent. Then substituent B would be another group—maybe a vinyl group or a methyl group.

Wait, but then substituent B can't be a methyl group because the NMR shows two methyl signals, implying two different methyl groups. So perhaps substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that would give a CH2 group, which the NMR does not show. So that's problematic.

Alternatively, substituent A could be O-CO-OCH(CH3)2, but that would have a methyl group in the substituent, but would that account for the two CH3 signals?

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and substituent B is CH2CH3, but again, that would have CH2 groups which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the substituents again.

The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group. The other substituent must contribute to the vinyl protons and the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like a substituent that's CH2CH2-O-CO- or something. No, wait.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is an ethenyl group (CH2=CH–), but that's a vinyl group without any methyl. Then where do the methyl signals come from? Because the NMR shows two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups, so two different methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a methyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, but a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group. Wait, let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an acetylenic group, but that's unlikely as it wouldn't produce vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl group that's part of a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group that doesn't have CH2 groups. For example, a substituent where the chain is arranged to avoid CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like CH2=CH-O-... No, perhaps substituent B is a substituent like CH2=CH- attached to something else, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would only give one methyl signal, not two. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures that would give:

- Two aromatic signals (para substitution, two substituents)
- Two vinyl H signals (maybe from two different vinyl groups, but that's unlikely)
Wait, the problem states two signals for vinyl-H. So perhaps there are two different vinyl groups, each giving their own signal.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is part of a group that has vinyl protons, such as a styryl group (like CH2=CH– attached to the ring).

Wait, let's imagine the structure: benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, which would have a double bond adjacent to the ester group. For example, substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 signals. Let's think about possible structures where there are two different methyl groups.

One possibility is that one substituent is an ester with a methyl group, and the other substituent is another group that also has a methyl group, but in a different environment.

Wait, but without any CH2 groups, the structure must avoid having any CH2 groups. So perhaps the substituents have branching that avoids CH2 groups.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are both esters, but that's not possible because the problem states it's an ester group, singular. Or perhaps it's a di-ester, but the problem says it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, so two substituents, but ester group is part of one substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would bring in CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. That would give a methyl group attached to the ester. So in that case, substituent A is O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent A could be O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that's an ester group, yes. So substituent A is O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2. But then, substituent B would be something else.

Wait, but then substituent B would have to account for the vinyl protons. Maybe substituent B is a vinyl group. But then, where do the two CH3 signals come from? Because substituent A has two methyl groups (CH(CH3)2 would have two CH3 groups attached to a central carbon). So the NMR would show a singlet for these two CH3 groups, but the problem states two signals for CH3, implying two distinct CH3 groups.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2, which would give two CH3 groups attached to a central carbon. But in that case, the two CH3 groups would be equivalent, so a single peak in NMR. But the problem says two signals for CH3 groups. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, substituent B could be CH2=CH-O-... No, that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Wait, another approach: the substituents are an ester and a methyl group attached in a way that doesn't involve CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would give only one CH3 group, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is an ester group that includes a methyl and another substituent. For example, substituent A could be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent A could be O-CO-OCH(CH3)2, but that would give two CH3 groups attached to a central carbon, which would be equivalent and thus one NMR signal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. So substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2– but that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH3, but that would give a CH2 group, which isn't present.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's think about the number of protons.

The aromatic ring has two substituents, so the ring has two substituents in para positions. Each substituent brings a certain number of protons.

The NMR shows two signals for aromatic H, each integrating to two H (since the aromatic ring has four H in total, two from each substituent environment).

The substituent with the ester group would likely be more complex, perhaps with branching.

Wait, let's think about the ester substituent. The ester group is O-CO-R, where R could be a methyl group, but that would give a CH3 in the NMR. But the problem states two signals for CH3, so perhaps R is a branched group with two different CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-OCH(CH3)2. So the ester is O-CO-O attached to a neopentyl group (maybe?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-OCH2CH(CH3)2, but that's getting too complicated and would introduce CH2 groups.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the possible molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -14 -2*2)/2 → (22+2-14-4)/2 = (6)/2=3. So 3 degrees: probably a benzene ring (3), plus maybe a double bond.

B) C12H14O2 → (2*12 +2 -14 -4)/2 → (24+2-14-4)=8 → 8/2=4. So 4 degrees: benzene (3), plus a double bond (1) or ring (but already accounted for).

C) C12H12O2 → (2*12 +2 -12 -4)/2 → (24+2-12-4)=10 → 10/2=5. 5 degrees: benzene (3), plus two double bonds or rings.

D) C11H12O2 → (2*11+2-12-4)/2 → (22+2-12-4)=8 → 8/2=4. 4 degrees: benzene (3), plus a double bond.

The compound has a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation), and perhaps substituents that contribute more. The ester group has a carbonyl (one double bond → 1 degree). So total is 4 degrees. So the formula must have 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, option A is 3 degrees, B is 4, C is 5, D is 4.

So options B and D have 4 degrees. So the correct formula is either B or D.

But let's think about the substituents. The ester group contributes one double bond (the carbonyl). So the benzene ring is three, ester is one, that's four. So the formula must have four degrees of unsaturation. So options B and D are possible.

So either B (C12H14O2) or D (C11H12O2).

Now, what about the molecular weight. Let's think about the structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents. Let's say substituent A is an ester group, which is O-CO-R, and substituent B is another group.

The NMR shows that the substituents contribute:

- Two CH3 groups (so two methyl groups)
- No CH2 groups, so all chains must be either CH3 or with branching that doesn't include CH2.

Additionally, the substituents must account for the vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but without any CH2 groups.

Wait, substituent B could be a group like CH2=CH–O–something, but that would introduce CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methylene group, but that would be CH2, which is not allowed.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl ester, but that doesn't account for the vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is an ester group (O-CO-R) where R is a methyl group, and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group in such a way that there are no CH2 groups.

Wait, like substituent B is CH2=CH–O–CO–OCH3? No, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. So substituent A is a neopentyl ester. Then substituent B would be a vinyl group.

But substituent B being a vinyl group would require a CH2=CH– group, which brings CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Wait, but the problem says there are no CH2 groups. So substituent B can't have any CH2.

So substituent B must be something like a vinyl group without any CH2. But that's impossible because a vinyl group is CH2=CH– which has CH2.

Hmm, perhaps substituent B is a group without any CH2, like a cyclopropane or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that's only one methyl, not two.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group that includes two methyl groups without any CH2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic signals → para substitution with two substituents.
- Two vinyl H signals → perhaps two different vinyl groups, but that's unlikely because substituents are only two. So more likely, one vinyl group with two different protons.
- Two CH3 signals → two different methyl groups.

So the substituents must include a vinyl group and two methyl groups (in two different environments).

Wait, perhaps substituent A is an ester group that includes a methyl group, and substituent B is a vinyl group connected to another methyl group.

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). Substituent B: CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. But that brings CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group where the vinyl is attached directly to the ring without any CH2. Wait, but vinyl is CH2=CH–, so it's impossible to avoid CH2.

Hmm, maybe substituent A is an ester with a methyl group, and substituent B is a methyl group attached via a double bond.

Wait, like substituent B is CH2=C(CH3)–. So substituent B is an allyl group with a methyl branch. So substituent B would be something like CH2=C(CH3)-O–... No, but then the ester is substituent A.

Wait, let's imagine substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester) and substituent B is CH2=C(CH3)-. So substituent B is an allyl group with a methyl branch.

In that case, substituent B would have a double bond, giving vinyl protons. The two CH3 groups would come from the methyl ester and the methyl branch on substituent B.

So substituent B is CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would have a structure like CH2=CH(CH3)-O–. But wait, that would be a substituent attached via oxygen, but substituent B is directly attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is CH2=CH(CH3)– attached to the ring.

So the structure would be benzene ring with substituent A (O-CO-OCH3) and substituent B (CH2=CH(CH3)–).

But substituent B would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed in the NMR. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group where the double bond is directly attached without any CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a phenyl group, but that wouldn't contribute to the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group in a way that doesn't have any CH2. But that's impossible because the vinyl group itself is CH2=CH–.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a methyl group, but that seems too complex and doesn't account for vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH(CH3)=CH2, but that has CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the possible structures that match the NMR.

The two signals for vinyl-H could be from a single group where the two protons are in different environments. For example, a trans double bond would have two protons as a doublet each, but perhaps in the NMR they appear as two separate signals.

Wait, but that's unclear. Alternatively, the substituent could be a di-substituted double bond, leading to two different environments for the vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is an ester group and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a second ester group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group, and substituent A is a methyl ester, and substituent B contributes the two CH3 groups. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached via a double bond. Like substituent B is CH(CH3)=CH2, but that has CH2 groups.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to calculate the molecular formula.

The benzene ring is C6H5-. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

Substituent A: ester group, O-CO-R. R could be a methyl group (R=CH3), so substituent A is O-CO-OCH3. That adds 2 oxygen? Wait, O-CO-O is part of the ester, so substituent A is -(O-CO-OCH3). So substituent A adds 1 oxygen (the ester group) and 3 carbons (the OCH3). So substituent A would be O-CO-OCH3, which is a methyl ester. So substituent A has 3 carbons (COOCH3) and 3 oxygens? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-R, so substituent A is O-CO-OCH3, which adds 3 carbons (O, C, O, CH3? No, the structure is O-CO-OCH3, so the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (the carbonyl is C, then O, then OCH3).

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 carbons (the carbonyl C, the O, and the CH3). But wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene. So substituent A is a methoxy group attached to a carbonyl, which is then part of the ester.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-OCH3. So substituent A adds 3 carbons (O-CO-O-CH3). So substituent A contributes 3 carbons.

Substituent B must contribute the rest.

The total formula is either C11H12O2 (D), C11H14O2 (A), C12H12O2 (C), or C12H14O2 (B).

If substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons), then substituent B must contribute the remaining carbons.

The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So substituent A adds 3, substituent B adds X.

Total carbons: 6 + 3 + X = ?

Looking at options:

Option D: C11H12O2 → 11 carbons. So 6+3 = 9, so substituent B adds 2 carbons.

Option A: C11H14O2 → 11 carbons. Same as D.

Option B: C12H14O2 → 12 carbons. 6 +3 =9, so substituent B adds 3.

Option C: C12H12O2 → 12 carbons. Substituent B adds 3.

So substituent B can contribute 2 or 3 carbons, depending on the option.

Now, substituent B must account for the vinyl protons and the two CH3 groups. Let's think about substituent B contributing 3 carbons.

If substituent B is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2–), but that has CH2 groups which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a methyl group attached to a double bond, but that would require a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a methyl group, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a group like CH2=C(CH3)–. That would be a vinyl group with a methyl branch. So substituent B would be CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the ring. But that brings in CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach: the number of hydrogens.

The molecular formula must account for all H in the molecule.

The benzene ring normally has 5 H if two substituents are attached para. But in our case, the substituents are such that the ring has two types of H, each with two H. So the aromatic part contributes 4 H.

The substituents contribute the remaining H.

Let's say substituent A is O-CO-OCH3. That contributes 3 H (from OCH3) and any H from the ester group. Wait, substituent A is O-CO-OCH3, which is a methoxy ester. So the substituent itself is O-CO-OCH3, which doesn't have any H except the OCH3 (3 H).

Substituent B must contribute the rest. The NMR has:

- Two aromatic H signals → 4 H on the ring.
- Two vinyl H → 2 H.
- Two CH3 → 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, and two different signals imply two different CH3 groups, each contributing 3 H → total 6 H).
Wait, but the NMR says two signals for –CH3 groups. So 2 signals, each integrating to 3 H → total of 6 H.

So substituent A (O-CO-OCH3) has 3 H (from CH3).

Substituent B must contribute another 3 H from CH3, and 2 H from vinyl.

Wait, substituent B contributes 2 H (vinyl) and 3 H (another CH3).

So substituent B would have a structure with a vinyl group and a CH3.

But how?

Perhaps substituent B is CH2=CH(CH3). That would have a vinyl group (2 H) and a methyl group (3 H). But substituent B is attached to the ring, so the structure would be CH2=CH(CH3)– attached to the ring. However, that would bring a CH2 group, which is not allowed because the NMR shows no CH2 signals.

So substituent B can't have any CH2 groups. Therefore, substituent B must have a structure without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached directly to a double bond. Like substituent B is CH2=C(CH3)– attached to the ring. But again, CH2 groups are present.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group where the double bond is directly attached to the ring without any CH2. But I don't think that's possible because a vinyl group is CH2=CH–.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond that is itself attached to the ring, but without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like C(CH3)=CH2. But that's CH2=CH-C(CH3), which introduces CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a methyl group, but that's getting too complex and doesn't account for the vinyl protons.

Wait, maybe substituent B is an acetylenic group, but that wouldn't give vinyl protons.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about the molecular formula again.

If substituent A is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons, 3 H), and substituent B is a group that contributes 3 carbons, 2 H (vinyl) and 3 H (another CH3), what would that look like?

Wait, 3 carbons: perhaps substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed. So that's out.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but again, that has CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl group, but without any CH2 groups. For example, substituent B could be CH(CH3)=CH2, but that has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is CH(CH3)=CH– attached to the ring. But that would have a CH2 group.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a methyl group attached to a double bond that's directly attached to the ring, but without any CH2 groups. I don't think that's possible.

Maybe substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond and a methyl group, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propargyl group (triple bond), but that wouldn't give vinyl protons.

I'm really not getting anywhere here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

The IR shows an ester, so the compound has an ester group. The NMR shows no CH2 groups, so all carbons are either CH3, CH, or part of the ring.

The options are either C11H14O2 or C12H12O2 (since they have the correct degrees of unsaturation).

Wait, another approach: the number of protons in the NMR.

In the NMR, the aromatic H contributes 4 H, the vinyl contributes 2 H, and the CH3 contributes 6 H (2 groups ×3 H each). So total H is 4 + 2 +6 =12 H.

Looking at the options:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H → too many.

B) C12H14O2 →14 → too many.

C) C12H12O2 →12 → matches.

D) C11H12O2 →12 → also matches.

So options C and D have 12 H. So the formula must be either C or D.

So earlier I thought that the degrees of unsaturation for the correct formula would be 4, which options B and D have. But now, the H count suggests options C and D.

Hmm, so now I'm confused because earlier the degrees suggested B and D, but the H count suggests C and D.

Wait, what's the correct way to reconcile this?

The benzene ring has 6 C and contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation.

Ester group contributes one degree (the carbonyl). So total degrees so far:4.

If substituent B adds another degree (like a double bond), then the total would be 5, which is option C.

Alternatively, if substituent B doesn't add any more degrees, then it's 4, which is option D.

But the NMR shows vinyl protons, which come from a double bond. So substituent B must have a double bond, adding another degree. So degrees of unsaturation would be 4 (from benzene and ester) plus 1 (from substituent B) = 5. So the formula must have 5 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C has 5 degrees of unsaturation.

So the formula would be C12H12O2.

But wait, the H count for option C is 12 H, which matches the NMR.

So the correct formula is C12H12O2, option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the IR spectrum. The NMR data provides the following insights:

1. **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic protons suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.

2. **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals corresponding to vinyl protons indicate the presence of a double bond in one of the substituents. The splitting patterns (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest coupling between protons on the double bond.

3. **Methyl Groups**: Two signals corresponding to methyl groups indicate the presence of two distinct CH₃ groups in the molecule. The absence of CH₂ signals implies that all carbons are either CH₃, CH, or part of the aromatic ring.

### Analysis of the Molecular Formula
The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons and 3 degrees of unsaturation. The ester group contributes one additional degree of unsaturation (from the carbonyl group). The vinyl group in one of the substituents adds another degree of unsaturation. Thus, the total degrees of unsaturation are:

\[
\text{Degrees of unsaturation} = 3 \, (\text{benzene}) + 1 \, (\text{ester}) + 1 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 5
\]

#### Option Analysis:
- **A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 3. This is insufficient to account for the benzene ring, ester, and vinyl group. **Eliminated**.
- **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 4. This accounts for the benzene ring and ester but not the vinyl group. **Eliminated**.
- **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5. This accounts for the benzene ring, ester, and vinyl group. Matches the required degrees of unsaturation. **Retained**.
- **D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 4. This accounts for the benzene ring and ester but not the vinyl group. **Eliminated**.

### Hydrogen Count
The NMR data indicates a total of 12 hydrogens (4 from the aromatic ring, 2 from vinyl protons, and 6 from two distinct CH₃ groups). Among the options, only **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** matches this hydrogen count.

### Conclusion
The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**, corresponding to option C.
