Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the main conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the main center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

I remember from my studies that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the inner surface will develop an induced charge. But wait, the conductor was neutral. Oh right, the cavity has a charge q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero (since it was uncharged and only the cavity has +q), the outer surface must have +q. But wait, no, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. The inner surface would have -q (induced by +q in the cavity), so the outer surface must have +q to balance it, because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer. But conductor was initially zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. The inner surface has -q due to the charge in the cavity. So the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the net charge is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field within the conductor's material. Then, the outer surface will have a charge of +q because the conductor is neutral. Because the inner is -q, so the outer must be +q to total zero for the conductor. But wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface is -q, so the outer must be +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, which would lead to the conductor's exterior having a charge that contributes to the electric field outside.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field there would be due to the outer charge, which is +q. But the configuration might affect where that charge is located. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so any excess charge resides on the outer surface, and the field outside would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity, and the charge in the cavity is off-center. Would that affect the outer charge distribution? Hmm, I think that the charges on the outer surface would adjust to maintain the spherical symmetry, but wait, no. Because the charge in the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be asymmetric, which would induce an asymmetric outer surface charge. But wait, that's not right. Because the conductor is a sphere, and when a charge is placed off-center in the cavity, the inner surface's charge distribution is induced as a mirror image, but the outer surface's charge distribution remains symmetric. Because the cavity's charge is inside the conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution wouldn't be affected by the position of the charge in the cavity. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the case of a spherical conductor with a cavity, if the cavity has a charge q, the inner surface will have an induced charge -q, regardless of where the q is placed inside the cavity. Then, because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q. So, the electric field outside the conductor (radius R) would be the same as if a charge +q were placed at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell with charge Q, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the outer surface has charge +q, so the field outside would be (k q)/R², but wait, no— because the point P is at a distance L from the main center. So the field at P depends on the charge distribution outside. Since the outer surface is a sphere, the field outside would be as if the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the charge q is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge would arrange to give a field outside as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait. The point P is a distance L from the main center, and l is the distance from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. So l is the distance from the cavity's center to P, and s is the distance between the two centers.

Wait, but for the electric field at P, which is outside the conductor, the only contributing charge is the outer surface's +q. So the field should be as if the +q were at the center of the main conductor. So the field strength would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q)/(L²).

Wait, because L is the distance from the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be the same as if the charge were at the center, because the outer surface is a sphere. So the answer would be option B: E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * q / L².

But wait, let me think again. Could the position of the charge in the cavity affect the outer field? No, because the outer surface's charge distribution doesn't depend on where the charge q is located inside the cavity, as long as the conductor itself is neutral. The inner surface's charge will arrange to cancel the field inside the conductor, but the outer surface's charge is symmetric. So when you're outside the conductor, the field only depends on the total outer charge, which is +q, and the field is as if it were a point charge at the center.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside a spherical conductor with a cavity, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, with a cavity containing a small charge $+q$. The cavity is off-center, at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. The inner surface of the conductor will develop an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. In this case, the outer surface has a charge of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the symmetry of the spherical outer surface.

3. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric, the electric field at $P$ is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface. The field is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Rejection of Other Options**:  
   - Option A and C involve distances related to the cavity's center and angle $\theta$, but these do not affect the field outside the conductor, as the outer surface's charge distribution ensures symmetry.  
   - Option D incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from the cavity's center to $P$) instead of $L$ (the distance from the conductor's center to $P$).  

Thus, the correct answer is based on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center to $P$.

Answer: B
