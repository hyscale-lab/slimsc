Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity is smaller, radius r, with its center separated by a distance s from the main conductor's center. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor, which is interesting. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the main center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

I remember that in conductors, charges reside on the surface, and when there's a cavity, the charges inside the cavity induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. So, if there's a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge opposite to q, right? Because the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Wait, no—wait. The conductor starts uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material can't hold a net charge, so the inner surface must cancel the field from +q inside the conductor material.

But then, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance, making the total conductor charge zero.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor has a total charge of +q (on the outer surface), the electric field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the conductor isn't a point charge. Oh, but because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly. So, the electric field outside (for points beyond R) is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. That's the principle of superposition and the shell theorem, right?

Wait, but the charge distribution on the conductor's outer surface depends on any external fields or other charges. But in this case, the conductor is isolated except for the charge inside the cavity. So, the outer surface's charge +q will distribute uniformly because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.

So, the electric field at any point outside the conductor should be due to the total charge on the conductor, which is +q, and it should be as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. So, the direction would be radially outward, and the magnitude would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to fit.

But wait, could there be any other factors? Like the position of the cavity's charge? Because the charge is placed off-center, does that affect the external field? Hmm. When you have a charge inside a cavity, it induces a charge on the inner surface. But the conductor's outer surface still has a charge such that the total is zero (since the conductor was initially neutral). So, the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces are -q and +q, respectively.

So, for the external field, it's the same as if you have a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity's charge (off-center) affects the inner fields but shouldn't influence the external fields because the conductor's outer surface charges cancel any internal asymmetry. The external field only depends on the total charge outside, which is +q at the center.

So, the position of point P relative to the cavity's center, the angle, and so on—those factors are irrelevant for the external field. Because from the outside, all the conductor's charge is considered as if it's a point charge at the center.

So the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L²). Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The other options involve l and s and theta. Why are those present? Oh, because the point P is at a certain position relative to the cavity's center. But the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so from the outside, all the charge contributes to the field, regardless of where P is. So, the distance from P to any internal point (cavity center) doesn't directly affect the field outside because the conductor's charge distribution screens that.

So yes, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$, and $l, L > R$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor remains zero. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly due to electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the total charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the cavity, the angle $\theta$, and the distance $l$ from the cavity's center to point $P$ do not affect the external electric field. The conductor's outer surface screens the internal asymmetry caused by the off-center cavity, and the external field depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface.

4. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: The electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the external field.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The formula involves $l^2$, which is not the correct distance for the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
