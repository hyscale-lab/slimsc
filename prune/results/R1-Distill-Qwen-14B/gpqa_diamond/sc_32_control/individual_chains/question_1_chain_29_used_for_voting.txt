Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which energy difference option allows them to be resolved?

The options are A through D, with different exponents on 10 and eV units.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the lifetime (Δt) of a state. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the exact form. I think for these kinds of problems, we can approximate ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Or sometimes people just take ħ/(Δt) as an approximate. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factor, but perhaps the exact value isn't critical here because the options are orders of magnitude apart.

So the idea is that the energy difference between the two levels needs to be larger than the uncertainty to be distinguishable. Wait, no, the lifetime is the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, no, wait. Each state has a certain lifetime. But when you have two states, the time they live for affects the energy uncertainty. Or maybe the energy difference must be such that the transition between them can be observed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The energy difference between the two states should be sufficient for us to measure them distinctly. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

But each state has its own lifetime, so each has an uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but in this question, we're probably considering that the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps each of their uncertainties. Or maybe for a system in a superposition, the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum required to resolve the two states.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime refers to the time the state exists before decaying, which relates to the energy uncertainty of that state. So each state has a certain ΔE based on their lifetime.

Wait, let's think about it: the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the state with a longer lifetime has a smaller energy uncertainty.

So for E1, lifetime is 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). For E2, lifetime is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2≈ ħ/(2e-8). Wait, but E2's lifetime is longer, so its energy uncertainty is smaller. So which one is more significant?

But wait, when trying to distinguish between two states, the energy difference between them (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties or at least the maximum of the two, perhaps. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either of their uncertainties, they might not be resolvable.

Wait, no. Let me think: The energy of each state has an uncertainty. For E1, the uncertainty is about ħ/(2Δt1) = ħ/(2e-9). Similarly for E2, it's ħ/(2e-8). So ΔE must be greater than these to be distinguishable.

Wait, no. Because the two states have different lifetimes and thus different uncertainties. But when you have two states, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties for them to be resolvable. Hmm, that might make sense because if the energy difference was smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks could overlap.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: The energy resolution is determined by the time over which you can measure. If the lifetimes are the times during which the states exist, then the uncertainty in energy would be based on each state's lifetime. So for E1 and E2, their respective ΔE's are  ħ/(2Δt1) and ħ/(2Δt2). So the energy difference between the two must be bigger than the sum of these uncertainties, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the uncertainty principle for each state. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/(Δt). Since the energy difference between E2 and E1 is the quantity we're considering, we need this difference to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but how? Let me think: if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, then the two states are resolvable. Because if the difference is bigger than the possible fluctuations, you can tell them apart.

Wait, no, perhaps each state's energy is only known within a certain uncertainty. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt1), and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). The energy difference between E2 and E1, ΔE = E2 - E1, must be at least greater than the sum of these two uncertainties to be distinguishable.

Wait, but maybe not the sum, but perhaps that the difference is larger than either of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than either uncertainty, then the two states won't overlap in their energy ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than either uncertainty, because each state's energy is uncertain by their respective ΔE. So if ΔE (the difference) is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states' energy ranges don't overlap, and thus can be distinguished.

Let me calculate the energy uncertainties for each state.

First, the reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the options are in eV, perhaps it's easier to convert everything into eV.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So, ħ in eV·s: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.60218e-19) eV·s ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/(2Δt).

So for E1, Δt1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 Δt1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Let's compute that:

6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-16+9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

So approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-16+8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So E1 has a bigger uncertainty because it has a shorter lifetime.

Now, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps each's uncertainty?

Wait, no. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. The difference between E2 and E1, ΔE = E2 - E1, must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for the two states to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, then the ranges might overlap.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that for two states to be resolved, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So if ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2, then the two states are resolvable.

Because if ΔE is larger than each state's uncertainty, then the states' energies don't overlap.

So let's compute the required ΔE.

So E2 has a larger energy (assuming E2 > E1) and thus, ΔE = E2 - E1.

We need ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2.

But since ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1, because E2's lifetime is longer, its uncertainty is smaller. So the main constraint would be ΔE > ΔE1.

Because ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2.

So if ΔE is larger than ΔE1, it would automatically be larger than ΔE2, since ΔE2 is smaller.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than ΔE1, which is approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.29e-7 → 1e-9 < 3.29e-7 → so no, cannot resolve.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C)1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is larger than 3.29e-7 (which is 0.000000329 eV). So 1e-4 is like 100 times larger than 3.29e-7. So that's okay.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → which is 0.00001 times 3.29e-7 (since 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329). So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.29e-7 → so no.

Therefore, the only option that meets ΔE > ΔE1 is option C:1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the calculations.

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV → 0.329e-6 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV.

Which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV → which is much larger than 0.329e-6 eV.

So yes, it's bigger. So the energy difference of 1e-4 eV would be sufficient to distinguish the two states.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) of a state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the energy uncertainties of both states to ensure they are distinguishable. 

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \), since \( \Delta E_1 > \Delta E_2 \). Therefore, \( \Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies \( \Delta E > \Delta E_1 \) is **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**.
