Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out.

So, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, with different exponents of 1 over plx raised to some power.

Let me start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, actually, I think it's the opposite. Because parallax is the apparent shift in position as seen from Earth's orbit. So a closer star would have a larger parallax. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. Right, d = 1/plx (if I ignore the parsec units for now).

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is constant in space. So the number of stars depends on volume, but since we're looking at a range in parallax, maybe I should think in terms of spherical shells or something.

Parallax plx is related to distance. So for a given parallax range, say between plx and plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let me think. Parallax (in arcseconds) is approximately 1/distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if plx increases, distance decreases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this straight. For a star at distance d (in parsecs), the parallax plx is 1/d. So, for example, a star at 10 parsecs has a parallax of 0.1 arcseconds.

Now, if I have a small change in parallax, dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's take plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The differential would be dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but maybe I don't need calculus here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius d would be proportional to the surface area of the shell, which is 4πd². But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So the number in a shell depends on the surface area (since volume is thin, the shell's thickness is dr, but for a thin shell, the volume is approx 4πd² dr).

But here, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate the number of stars in a range of parallax (dplx) to plx.

Let me rephrase. For a given parallax range dplx, what's the change in the number of stars? Since plx = 1/d, the distance d corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx.

So a change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in d. Let's find the corresponding range in distance. If plx changes by dplx, then d changes by dd = (d²) dplx. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = (-1/plx²) dplx → dplx = - (plx²) dd. So the change in distance dd is related to the change in parallax by dplx = - plx² dd.

But I'm not sure if I'm going about this the right way. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d. The number would be N = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume), and dr is the thickness of the shell.

But we need this number in terms of a parallax range. Since plx is 1/d, and d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting dr into the expression for N, we get N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) → N ∝ dplx / plx^4.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me go step by step.

Number of stars in a thin shell (dV) is N = n * dV. For a thin shell of radius d and thickness dr, dV ≈ 4π d² dr.

We know that dr = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx → dr = - (1/(plx²)) dplx.

So substituting dr into dV: dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 [ - (1/(plx²)) dplx ].

Wait, but that would give dV as proportional to dplx / plx^4. So the number N is proportional to dV, because n is a constant. So N ∝ dV ∝ dplx / plx^4.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which would be N/(dplx) → which would be proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but the options have options like 1/plx^4, which is option A. So that would imply that the number of stars per unit plx range decreases with 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me think without worrying about the minus sign.

So, the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is N / dplx. From above, N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2). So N = n *4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So when we divide N by dplx, we get (N/dplx) = n *4π / plx^4. So this is the number density per unit plx, and it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because I've heard that the number of stars per unit parallax increases as 1/plx^3. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume between plx and plx + dplx. So the volume between distance d and d + dd, where dd is the corresponding change in distance for dplx.

Wait, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → dplx = - plx² dd.

So the volume between d and d+dd is approximately 4π d² dd.

Expressing this in terms of dplx: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) → 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (dplx / plx^2) ) → 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that would make the volume V = 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π d^2 dd = 4π (d^2) * (dplx plx^2) )? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd. The volume is (4/3)π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small dd, this approximates to 4π d² dd.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d² dd.

But we want how many stars per unit plx range. So for a small dplx, the corresponding change in distance is dd = (d^2) dplx, because d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2 ) dplx.

Wait, plugging that into the volume: 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) dplx ) ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit dplx is (n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx ) / dplx ) = n *4π / plx^4.

So the answer would be the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought the number of stars increases with distance, so more stars are farther away. So as plx decreases (since plx is inversely proportional to distance), the number of stars per unit plx should increase as 1/plx^3. Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

The number of stars per unit volume is n (since uniform distribution). The volume in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr.

Expressed in terms of parallax, d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ) ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But since we're considering the magnitude, perhaps the negative sign can be ignored, so the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

The number of stars in this volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit dplx is (n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx ) / dplx ) = n *4π / plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number decreases rapidly as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx means closer stars, which are less in number if they're uniformly distributed. So as plx increases (closer), the number of stars in each plx slice decreases as 1/plx^4, which matches option A.

But I'm a bit confused because I might have heard that the number of stars per unit distance increases with distance, but in terms of parallax, which inversely relates to distance, the dependence changes.

Wait, in terms of distance d, the number of stars per unit distance (dr) in a shell is N/dr = n*4π d² dr/dr = n*4π d². So it's proportional to d squared. But since d is 1/plx, substituting gives that the number per unit dr is proportional to (1/plx)^2. But I'm not sure if this is the same as the question.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit plx range, not per unit distance. So perhaps the correct way is to express it as 1/(plx^3) because when you change variables, you have to consider the Jacobian.

Wait, maybe I should think about the differential element. The number of stars in a thin slice of plx between plx and plx + dplx.

The corresponding distance ranges from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd = (1/plx^2) dplx (since plx = 1/d → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx).

The volume between these distances is approximately 4π (d^2 + 2d (dd) + (dd)^2 ) - d^2 ) → but for small dd, this is approx 4π d² dd.

So V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) dplx ) → V = 4π d^2 (dplx / plx^2) ) → since d =1/plx.

Wait, substituting d =1/plx, V =4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) dplx ) ) → V =4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is N = n * V = n *4π d^2 (dd) = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) → which is n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx range is N/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

Wait, but another perspective: when you have uniform distribution in space, the number density is constant. So the number in a volume element dV is n dV. When considering parallax, you want to express dV in terms of plx.

Since V is 4π (d)^2 dd, and dd is (d^2) dplx (since d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx → dplx = - plx^2 dd → dd = -d^2 dplx.

Wait, perhaps I should express dV in terms of plx. So dV = 4π d² dd. Since d =1/plx → dd = -d² dplx.

So dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx^2) dplx ) ) → dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Again, the number of stars is n dV → n * (4π / plx^4) dplx.

So per unit dplx, it's n *4π / plx^4. So yes, the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the correct option is A: ~1/plx^4. But wait, I thought I remember that number of stars per unit volume in space depends on 1/(distance^2), but perhaps when considering parallax, the exponent is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential elements. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those parallaxes.

Another approach: think about the number of stars in a thin slice of parallax. The volume associated with a thin slice of parallax dplx is the same as the volume between two spherical shells with radii d and d + dd, where d =1/plx and dd is the change in d for a change dplx.

As before, dd = -d^2 dplx. So the volume is 4π (d^2) dd → 4π d^2 (-d^2 dplx) ) → 4π d^4 (-dplx).

Since d=1/plx, d^4 = 1/plx^4. So volume becomes 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx).

The number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx).

So the number per unit dplx is (n *4π (1/plx^4)) (-dplx) ) / dplx → n*4π (1/plx^4).

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer is A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that the number of stars per unit distance (dr) increases with distance, as the volume element grows with r². So if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then the number per unit plx should decrease more steeply than 1/plx^3.

Wait, another angle: The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between 1/plx and 1/(plx+dplx). Let me compute the volume between two spheres of radius r and r+dr, where r =1/plx.

So the volume V = (4/3)π (r+dr)^3 - (4/3)π r^3.

Expanding (r + dr)^3 = r^3 +3r^2 dr +3r (dr)^2 + (dr)^3.

Subtracting, V ≈ 4π r^2 dr.

In terms of plx, r =1/plx → dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So V =4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Number of stars N is n * V → n * (-4π / plx^4 ) dplx.

So the number per unit dplx is (N/dplx) = n *4π / plx^4.

So again, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm not sure because I've heard that the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but I'm talking about per unit parallax here. So perhaps the exponent is correct.

So the conclusion is that the number per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4. So the answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume expression, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, \( N \propto n \, dV \), where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars. Thus, \( N \propto \frac{n}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \).

The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is \( \frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \). Dividing \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \), we find:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{n}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
