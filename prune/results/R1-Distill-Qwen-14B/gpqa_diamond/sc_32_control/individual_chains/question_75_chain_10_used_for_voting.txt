Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They're using a plasmid with an inducible system. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they check the expression, it's not working as expected. So they look at the DNA sequence of the plus strand of their construct. 

The problem is in the DNA sequence they provided. I need to figure out why the protein isn't overexpressing. Let's look at the options and the possible issues. 

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, a missense would change an amino acid, but if the tag is at the N-terminus, a mutation there might prevent proper folding or recognition, but would the protein not express at all? Or maybe it would be expressed but not detected. But the question says the overexpression isn't happening. I'm not sure.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon somewhere. So if the ribosome stops early, the protein would be shorter than expected. But why would the construct not express at all? Maybe the stop codon is in frame and causes termination, but the construct is probably designed so that the HA tag is followed by GADD45G. Let me look at the DNA sequence provided to see if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. The HA tag is a short peptide, I think. If there's no linker, maybe the protein is being degraded because of improper folding or the tag is causing the cell's proteases to attack. But that would lead to truncated proteins, not necessarily no expression. Plus, the question says they're not getting overexpression, so maybe the construct isn't being expressed at all.

Option D: The tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, tRNAs recognize codons. If the construct has a UAA stop codon, but the mouse's tRNAs don't recognize it, would that cause issues? Wait, no, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So the presence of a stop codon would cause termination regardless of the organism's tRNA availability. So if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate early.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, which is the plus strand, let's look for stop codons. The coding sequence starts with ATG (the start codon). Then continues. I need to look for in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA codons.

Let me try to parse the sequence. Let's break it down into triplets, starting from ATG.

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCACAGCCAGGATGCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC GCT GCG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACC TCG ATC CAG GCT TTT GCT GCC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GCC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, let me write it in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCACAGCCAGGATGCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC GCT GCG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACC TCG ATC CAG GCT TTT GCT GCC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GCC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA

Wait, looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. Let's scan through:

Looking at each triplet:

- ATG: start
- TAC: Tyr
- CCA: Pro
- TAC: Tyr
- GAT: Asp
- GTT: Val
- CCA: Pro
- GAT: Asp
- TAC: Tyr
- GCC: Ala
- AAA: Lys
- TGA: STOP. Oh wait, here's a TGA codon. That's a stop codon. So this is in the middle of the coding sequence.

So the DNA has a TGA in the coding sequence, which is a stop codon. So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome would hit the TGA and terminate, producing a truncated protein.

But wait, why is this a problem? Because the plasmid is in Chinese hamster ovary cells, right? So the construct is in mammalian cells. Do mammalian cells have the machinery to read TGA as a stop codon?

Yes, TGA is a standard stop codon in all cells. So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, then the HA would be present, but the GADD45G would be cut short. But the question says that overexpression isn't happening as expected. So perhaps the truncated protein is not functional, but the presence of a stop codon would at least produce some smaller protein. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of TGA disrupts the reading frame beyond, but the initial part is already messed up.

Wait, looking back, the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG, so it's the coding strand. The fact that the plus strand has a TGA codon in the middle would mean that the mRNA would have a UAC at that point? Wait, no, wait. The DNA is in the plus strand. The mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the DNA's template strand. So the plus strand is the same as the mRNA except T becomes U.

Wait, the provided sequence is the plus (coding) strand. So the mRNA would be the same as this sequence, with T replaced by U. So the mRNA would have, at the point of TGA in DNA, a UGA codon, which is also a stop. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is another stop codon. 

Wait, that's not correct. No, because the plus strand is the coding strand. The mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand. So the mRNA is complementary to the template. Let me clarify this.

The DNA is double stranded: the coding (sense) strand and the template (antisense) strand. The coding strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except T becomes U. So in this case, the plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same, replacing T with U.

So the plus strand has a TGA codon in the middle. So the mRNA would have UGA codon. UGA is a stop codon, which is recognized by release factors. So the ribosome would terminate there, leading to a truncated protein.

But why would the construct not overexpress? Because the protein is stopped early, so it's not full-length. But the question says that the overexpression isn't happening. Maybe the construct isn't being expressed at all.

Wait, another possibility. If the construct has a stop codon in the early part, perhaps the expression is very low or nothing. But why would the presence of a stop codon cause that? Because the ribosome would terminate early, but the mRNA is still made. If the first part of the mRNA is being translated, but the protein is short, then maybe it's being degraded quickly. But the question says that the overexpression isn't happening, so perhaps the construct is not being transcribed or translated.

Wait, but the presence of a stop codon in the middle would not prevent the mRNA from being made. So the mRNA would be present, but the protein would be truncated.

But the question states that the overexpression isn't happening. So the issue could be that the construct is not being expressed, perhaps due to a transcription issue or a readthrough or something else. Alternatively, the presence of a stop codon might not be the issue. 

Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me re-examine the DNA sequence. The question says that the construct is for GADD45G, and they added an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G.

Looking at the beginning of the DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is start (Met). So the HA tag should be right after. Let me check:

ATG (start) TAC (Tyr) CCA (Pro) TAC (Tyr) GAT (Asp) GTT (Val) CCA (Pro)... 

Wait, but the HA tag is a short peptide. The HA tag's DNA sequence is added before the GADD45G. So the construct should be: HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but in the DNA sequence provided, the first codon is ATG, then TAC, which is Tyr. If the HA tag is added as the N-terminal, the HA sequence should be before the start codon of GADD45G. Maybe the HA is part of the ATG. Wait, that can't be. Let me think about how the construct is designed.

The HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence is added before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the full construct is: HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G coding sequence, under the control of a promoter. The construct starts with the start codon for the HA-GADD45G fusion protein.

Wait, but the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG (start codon), which would be the start of the HA-GADD45G fusion. So the HA coding sequence is part of the ATG. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence would be before the ATG of GADD45G. But in the provided DNA, the first codon is ATG, so maybe the HA tag is part of the start codon? That can't be. Oh, wait, perhaps the HA tag is a few amino acids, so their coding sequences are before the start codon of GADD45G.

Wait, but the provided DNA starts with ATG, which would be the start for GADD45G, but if the HA is before that, then the ATG should be after the HA's coding sequence. So perhaps the HA's coding sequence is included before the ATG, making the HA tag part of the N-terminus. 

Wait, the question says the HA is at the N-terminus. So the construct should be: HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA's start codon is before GADD45G's. But in the provided DNA, the first codon is ATG for GADD45G, which would mean the HA is not present. But the question says that the HA was added as a tag. So perhaps the DNA sequence provided is just the GADD45G coding sequence with the HA added, but maybe the construct has a problem in the HA sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the DNA sequence provided is the entire coding sequence, including the HA tag. So the ATG is the start for the HA-GADD45G fusion. But the HA is a short peptide, so the first few codons should code for it. For example, HA is usually something like YPYDVPDYA, which is about 11 amino acids, so about 33 nucleotides. Let me check the first few codons.

The first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT... So the amino acids would be:

ATG: Met

TAC: Tyr

CCA: Pro

TAC: Tyr

GAT: Asp

GTT: Val...

Wait, that's the start of the HA tag? Let me think: the HA tag is often encoded by the sequence 5'-ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT CCA-3', which translates to Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro. Wait, but that's just the start. So perhaps that's part of the HA tag. 

Wait, the HA tag is a small peptide, so the first few codons should code for it. For example, the HA tag is 11 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence for the HA would be something like TAC TAC GAT GTT CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA TAC.

But wait, the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA... So after the ATG (start), the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), etc. Hmm, that's six amino acids after the start. That doesn't seem like the HA tag. Maybe there's a mistake in the construct.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is added as a sequence before the ATG, meaning that the start codon for the fusion protein is the ATG. So the HA would be encoded before the ATG. But that's not how it's done. The start codon is the first ATG, so the HA must be in the first few codons after the ATG. 

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is added by inserting the HA coding sequence right before the GADD45G's own start codon. So the construct would be: HA sequence + ATG + GADD45G. But in the DNA sequence provided, the first codon is ATG, so that's the start. So perhaps the HA is encoded within the first few codons.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA is inserted before the ATG, but that would make the ATG the start codon for GADD45G, and the HA would be after. No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the HA is encoded as a fusion, so the HA's coding sequence is before the ATG, making the fusion protein start with HA followed by GADD45G.

No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Looking at the DNA sequence, the presence of a TGA codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. So the protein might not be functional, but why isn't it being expressed at all?

Wait, perhaps the stop codon is in the middle, but the construct is designed to have the HA tag and the GADD45G. If the stop codon is in the HA region, then the HA might not be expressed, which could interfere with the expression of GADD45G. Or maybe the presence of the stop codon prevents the expression of the full-length protein, so the construct isn't working. But the question is why the overexpression isn't happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop codon is in the HA tag. For example, if the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon, then the HA itself might not be expressed properly. But why would that prevent the expression of the full-length GADD45G?

Wait, perhaps the construct is intended to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but the presence of a stop codon in the HA region would cause the ribosome to terminate early, so the HA isn't made, and the GADD45G isn't either because it's after. But that doesn't make sense because the GADD45G would be after the HA in the mRNA. Oh wait, no, in the mRNA, it's all one sequence. So if the HA has a stop codon, the ribosome would terminate after the HA, and the GADD45G wouldn't be translated. 

Wait, but the mRNA is a single ORF. So the entire coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA has a stop codon, then the ribosome would terminate at that point, not translating GADD45G. So in that case, no full-length protein would be made, and only the HA would be made, but maybe not even that if the stop codon is in the middle of the HA. 

Looking back, the DNA has a TGA codon in the middle of the provided sequence. Let me count where that is.

Looking at the DNA sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCACAGCCAGGATGCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC GCT GCG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACC TCG ATC CAG GCT TTT GCT GCC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GCC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA 

Wait, the first TGA is at position: Let's count.

1-3: ATG (1)
4-6: TAC (2)
7-9: CCA (3)
10-12: TAC (4)
13-15: GAT (5)
16-18: GTT (6)
19-21: CCA (7)
22-24: GAT (8)
25-27: TAC (9)
28-30: GCC (10)
31-33: AAA (11)
34-36: TGA (12)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would have UGA at that position. So the first 12 codons would be translated, then the ribosome stops. So the HA tag (if it's the first few codons) isn't even fully translated, and the GADD45G isn't expressed. So the fusion protein isn't made. Hence, no overexpression.

So the problem is that the construct has a TGA stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, leading to premature termination. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Missense mutation in HA sequence.

B) Ribosome terminated early.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA.

Hmm, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which matches the presence of a stop codon. So the issue is that the construct has an in-frame stop codon, causing early termination. So the correct answer would be B.

Alternative option, option D: No tRNA for UAA. But that's not related because the stop codon is TGA, which is recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So D is incorrect.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. But the presence of a stop codon would prevent the protein from being made beyond that point, so the protein would be too short, but the question says the overexpression isn't happening, which could mean the protein isn't expressed at all. However, if the stop codon is present, the protein would be expressed but truncated. So maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, but the presence of a stop codon would make the mRNA produce a short peptide, but the question says that the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon, preventing the fusion protein from being made. 

So in this case, the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an N-terminal HA sequence, is not expressing the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a TGA codon in the middle of the coding sequence, which is a stop codon recognized by release factors. This would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence could affect the tag's recognition or function, but it would not prevent the expression of the full-length protein. The issue here is the absence of overexpression, which points to a broader problem like premature termination.
- **Option B:** The presence of a TGA stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence (as observed in the DNA sequence) would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early. This prevents the full-length protein from being synthesized, aligning with the observation that overexpression is not occurring.
- **Option C:** The lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would typically result in degradation of the nascent protein rather than a complete lack of expression. The stop codon issue is more consistent with the observed problem.
- **Option D:** The tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant here because stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. The issue is the premature termination caused by the TGA codon.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This matches the observation that overexpression is not occurring.
