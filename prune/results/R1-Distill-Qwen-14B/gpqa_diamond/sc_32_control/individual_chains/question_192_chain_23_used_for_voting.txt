Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity of radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the conductor isn't just a solid sphere; it's like a shell with a cavity inside. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, which makes sense.

Then, they place a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. I remember that when you have a charge inside a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so how does that work?

Wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right, for a conductor, the charges reside on the surfaces. So when you have a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. So if +q is inside, the inner surface must have -q.

But wait, the conductor is neutral. So the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the total induced charge on the inner and outer surfaces must cancel each other out. Or wait, wait. Let me think again. The conductor itself is neutral, so any induced charges must balance. So the inner surface has -q, which means the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero. Because the conductor's original charge is zero, so inner (−q) plus outer (+q) equals zero.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor's net charge is zero. So the induced charges must sum to zero. So when a charge +q is inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero because outer is +q and inner is -q, so they cancel each other.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged. When you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge. Since the cavity is not connected to anything, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge inside attracts opposite charges. So the inner surface has -q. But the conductor was neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q so that the total charge remains zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, and the inner has -q, the outer must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface is +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor's own material must have a net charge of zero. So the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must add up to zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q. Yes, that makes sense. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the spherical conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from point P to the center of the cavity is l, and l, L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is θ. So s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, the setup: the cavity is inside the conductor, and its center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity is shifted a bit from the center. So the conductor is a sphere of radius R, and the cavity has radius r, centered at a point s away from the conductor's center.

Now, point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the conductor's center. The point P is a point in space outside, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. And the angle between l and s is theta.

I'm a bit confused about the geometry here. Let me try to visualize. The conductor's center is at point O. The cavity's center is at point O', which is s distance away from O. Point P is somewhere in space, l distance away from O', and L distance from O. The angle between the vectors OO' and OP is theta.

Wait no, the angle between l and s is theta. Oh, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the conductor's center and the cavity's center. So I'm picturing O and O' separated by s. Point P is l away from O', but also L away from O. So the arrangement forms a triangle between O, O', and P.

But how does that affect the electric field at P?

The problem asks for the magnitude of the electric field E at point P.

I remember that the electric field outside a conductor is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But that's for a spherical conductor. But in this case, the conductor is not a solid sphere; it's a shell with a cavity. Hmm.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, right? Because the inner surface is -q, and the conductor's total charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the outer surface is a sphere. So from the outside, the electric field at any point due to the outer surface's charge would be as if the charge were at the center. So the electric field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / r², where r is the distance from the center. So in this case, the enclosed charge is +q, and r is L, the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, what about the inner charge +q? No, the inner charge is inside the cavity, so it's shielded. Because for a conductor, charges inside the cavity don't affect the electric field outside the conductor. Because the conductor's material's induced charges shield the cavity's contents.

Wait, no, wait. The cavity is inside the conductor. So the charge +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when looking from outside the conductor, the only charge that contributes to the electric field is the outer surface charge, which is +q. So the electric field at P would be due to the +q on the outer surface, located at the center of the conductor.

So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors? For example, the position of the cavity's center being s away from the conductor's center. Does that affect the electric field outside?

Wait, the outer surface's charge is distributed in such a way that it looks like the charge is at the center. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves spherically symmetrically, regardless of the position of the cavity. So the electric field outside would be the same as if all the charge were at the center, so the position of the cavity doesn't matter beyond that.

Wait, is that correct? Because the cavity is shifted, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. The charges on the outer surface are free to move, so they would arrange themselves to make the outer surface a uniform shell. So the induced charges on the outer surface won't be affected by the position of the cavity. So the electric field outside would depend only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.

So that would mean that the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So the correct option would be B.

But wait, am I missing any other contributions? For example, does the charge inside the cavity influence the field outside? I thought it doesn't, because the conductor's material would shield it. The conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the inner surface would cancel the field inside the conductor. But the field outside is due to the outer charges only.

Alternatively, sometimes when you have a cavity with a charge, the inner surface induces a charge, and the outer surface can have a charge, but from the outside, it's as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, I'm pretty confident that the field outside would only depend on the charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center. So option B is correct.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**: The conductor is initially uncharged and has a spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the induced charge on the inner surface.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center. The charge on the outer surface of the conductor is $+q$, and it is distributed spherically symmetrically. Thus, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor is as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Distance and Geometry**: Point $P$ is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance $l$ from $P$ to the center of the cavity and the angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$ are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the conductor's outer surface ensures shielding of the cavity's internal charge, and the electric field outside depends solely on the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center.

5. **Final Expression**: The electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches option **B**.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the electric field outside depends on $q$ and $l^2$, $l$ is not the correct distance to use here, as $L$ is the relevant distance from the center of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
