Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is 3P1. Wait, no, wait, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh right, so if Planet_2 has a period of, say, 100 days, Planet_1 would be about 34 days. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe a subgiant or something, but same radius. So Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has M1 = 2*M2, where M2 is the mass of Star_2. But R1 = R2, since both have same radii.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So which one has a higher transit probability?

I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_star + a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a (1 - e)) / (a (1 - e)) + ... Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 )^(1/2)) )? No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by something.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a^2 + (R_s)^2)) )) ). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 times the impact parameter term. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the formula.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability P can be approximated by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a^2 + R_s^2)) )) ) ... No, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the orbital distance in units of the star's radius. So P ∝ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1 / a) ), but wait, no, because a is the semi-major axis, which depends on the orbital period and the star's mass.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a^2 + R_s^2)) ) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should look for a more precise formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is edge-on enough to cause a transit. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a^2 + R_s^2)) ) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by the sum of (a/(R_s))^2 plus 1, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the transit probability is mainly determined by two factors: the size of the planet relative to the star (R_p/R_s) squared, and the likelihood that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front. The alignment depends on the planet's distance from the star. A planet with a larger semi-major axis is farther away, so the chance that it transits is lower because the relative area it can block is smaller, or something like that.

Wait, no, because if a planet is further away (larger a), the star's disk appears smaller, so the chance of the planet's path crossing the star's disk is lower. So the transit probability is lower for planets with larger a. So P is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/R_s)) ), because a larger a means the planet is farther, making the transit less likely.

Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s))) ) * some factor. Let me think again.

Another approach: The transit probability is the area of the star that the planet can block, divided by the total area of the sphere from which it can appear. Or something like that. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio between the star's radius and the distance from the star, i.e., (R_s / a). Because if the planet is closer (smaller a), the transit is more likely. So P ≈ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s * a )

So P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s * a ) )

Wait, that would make sense. Because if a is smaller, then a is in the denominator, so P increases. So closer planets have higher transit probabilities, which makes sense.

So now, I need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.

But wait, in this problem, the planets have the same mass, but I don't know their radii. Hmm, but the question gives the masses of the stars and the periods. Oh, wait, perhaps I can find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that P^2 = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a^3. Since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass (as they are Earth-like), we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s.

So P^2 = (4π² / (G M_s)) ) a^3 => a^3 = (G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

But perhaps it's easier to take the ratio of a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

We have P1 = (1/3) P2.

Because the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( M1 / M2 ) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

Because, from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_s P^2 )/(4 π² ), so a1^3/a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/1) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )

= 2 * ( (P2^2 /9) / P2^2 ) )

= 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

But wait, I think I messed up the ratio. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the formula is a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

M1 = 2 M2 → M1/M2 = 2.

P1 = P2/3 → P1^2 = P2^2 / 9.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = 2 * ( (P2^2 /9) ) / P2^2 )

= 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So yes, (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Compute (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

That's the semi-major axis of Planet_1 compared to Planet_2.

Now, back to transit probability P.

Earlier, I thought P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a )

Wait, but in the question, the planets have the same mass, but it's not given that they have the same radius. Oh wait, the question doesn't state their radii. Hmm, this is a problem. Because if the planets have the same mass but different radii, their R_p would vary.

Wait, the problem says both planets have the same masses, but no information about their radii. So maybe the radii are the same? Because Earth-like planets have similar densities, so same mass implies same radius. Oh yes, because density is mass/volume, and volume scales with radius^3. So if two Earth-like planets have the same mass, their radii should be the same. So R_p1 = R_p2.

So R_p is the same for both planets.

So, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p^2) / ( R_s * a )

So since R_p is the same for both, we can compare P1 and P2 by comparing (1/( R_s * a )) for each.

Let's compute P1/P2.

P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a )

So P1/P2 = [ (R_p1^2) / (R_s1 * a1) ) ] / [ (R_p2^2)/( R_s2 * a2 ) ]

But R_p1 = R_p2, so R_p1^2 / R_p2^2 =1.

Thus,

P1/P2 = ( R_s2 * a2 ) / ( R_s1 * a1 )

We know that R_s1 = R_s2. Because both stars have the same radius.

So,

P1/P2 = ( R_s2 * a2 ) / ( R_s1 * a1 ) = ( R_s * a2 ) / ( R_s * a1 ) )= a2 / a1.

Earlier, we found that a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no. Wait, a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) a2 → a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

So, substituting into the ratio:

P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

Wait, that can't be right because the transit probability depends on a being larger leading to lower probability.

Wait, no. Because in our formula, P is proportional to 1/(a R_s). Since a1 is smaller than a2 (a1=0.606 a2), then 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2.

So P1 would be larger than P2.

Wait, perhaps I should go back and think about the ratio again.

Wait, a1 is 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So in the ratio P1/P2 = a2/a1 → (1.65 a1)/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

So P1 > P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is much higher. So which is correct.

Wait, my calculation says P1 is 1.65 times more probable than P2. So if the question is about which is higher, Planet_1's probability is higher, so the correct answer would be either C or D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

We have a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So when computing P1/P2 = a2 / a1 = (1.65 a1)/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times higher. Hence, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (\(R_p\)) are assumed to be the same. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), so the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis (\(a\)).

### Step 1: Comparing Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period (\(P\)) and the star's mass (\(M_s\)):

\[
a^3 \propto \frac{M_s \cdot P^2}{G}
\]

Taking the ratio of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2}
\]

Given \(M_1 = 2M_2\) and \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = 2 \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\). Therefore:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606 \cdot a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options provided:

- **Option C**: Correct, as Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the probability difference is not ~2.7 times.
