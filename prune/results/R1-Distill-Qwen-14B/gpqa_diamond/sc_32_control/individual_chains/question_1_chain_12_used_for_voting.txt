Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The task is to determine which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes people use ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ for simplicity, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the idea is that the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the states might not be distinguishable due to the uncertainty. So the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is related to their lifetimes.

Each state has its own lifetime. So I guess each has its own uncertainty in energy. Let me think. For a state with lifetime τ, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately ħ/τ. So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2, τ2 is 1e-8, so ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8). 

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? So the difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, this ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps greater than the individual uncertainties. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe the minimum condition is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state, but which one to take? Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty.

Wait, let's think. If you have two energy levels, their energies have uncertainties. To see them as separate, the separation between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if their separation is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

So for two states, the condition would be ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Alternatively, perhaps it's actually that the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy is between their uncertainties, maybe they can't be resolved. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. Here, the lifetimes (Δt) are given for each state, so the uncertainties in energy for each would be ΔE_i ≈ ħ/τ_i.

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9 s). For E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8 s). Let me compute these in eV.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But to convert to eV·s, I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, τ1 is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is (6.582e-16 eV·s) / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. Hmm, that's 0.6582e-6 eV, which is 0.6582 microeV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV, which is 0.6582e-7 eV, or 0.06582 microeV.

So the uncertainties for E1 and E2 are 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV, respectively.

So the total uncertainty when considering both states might be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Because if the energy difference is larger than the sum, then it's clear. Or perhaps it's the product or the maximum. Hmm. Wait, what's the correct condition here.

Wait, the energy levels are E1 and E2. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in ΔE. Hmm, but the uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2, because E1 and E2 are measured with their own uncertainties.

So, ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let me compute that.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

Adding them: 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV for the levels to be resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1 n eV → 0.001 microeV. Way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01 picoeV. Even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 100 microeV. That's much larger than 7.24e-7 (which is 0.724 microeV). So 100 microeV is way bigger, so the condition is met. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01 microeV. That's larger than 7.24e-7? No, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 0.0001 microeV. Wait, no, wait: 1e-8 eV is 0.01 microeV, because 1e-6 eV is 1 microeV. So 0.01 microeV is 1e-8 eV. 

Wait, wait. Wait, 1e-7 eV is 0.1 microeV. 1e-8 is 0.01 microeV. So the sum (7.24e-7 eV) is 0.724 microeV. So option C is 1e-4 eV = 100 microeV. That's way larger than the required 0.724 microeV. So C would be resolvable. What about the other options?

Option A is 1e-9 eV → 0.001 microeV. Way too small. Option B is even smaller. Option D is 1e-8 → 0.01 microeV. Still smaller than 0.724 microeV. So the only option that is bigger than 0.724 microeV is C.

Wait but wait a second, does the energy difference need to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or just larger than the individual maximum?

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the energy lines' widths. Each state has a natural linewidth determined by its lifetime. So the width of E1 is ΔE1 ≈ 0.658 microeV, and E2 is ΔE2 ≈ 0.0658 microeV. So the lines would be broadened, and if the separation is larger than the sum of the two half-widths, the peaks can be resolved.

So the minimum separation is ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) → which is about 0.724 microeV, as I calculated before. So any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.

So looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV = 100 microeV) is much larger than this. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another point. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of energy and time is about ħ. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the state with a longer lifetime (E2, τ=1e-8 s) has a smaller energy uncertainty (since ΔE is ħ/τ, longer τ → smaller ΔE).

So the energy uncertainty for E2 is 0.0658e-6 eV, and E1 is 0.658e-6 eV. So the sum is about 0.724e-6 eV. So the energy difference must be bigger than that to be resolved.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV, which is 0.724 microeV.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 microeV → no.
B) 1e-11 eV → 0.000001 microeV → no.
C) 1e-4 eV → 100 microeV → yes.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01 microeV → no.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, the lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainties in energy for each state are approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} = 0.6582 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.06582 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 0.6582 \, \mu\text{eV} + 0.06582 \, \mu\text{eV} = 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \). Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** Too small.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.000001 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** Too small.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 100 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** Much larger than \( 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} \), satisfies the condition.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \, \mu\text{eV} \):** Too small.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
