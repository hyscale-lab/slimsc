Okay, so I have this question here about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They are also known as enantiomers. These compounds usually have a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings with substituents. I'm thinking about their structure. So, biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2', and 6 and 6' on each ring. The groups are nitro and carboxylate ester (since it's methyl ester).

Wait, so the substituents on each ring are in the 2 and 6 positions. Hmm, nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups. Now, in biphenyl structures, the single bond between the two benzene rings can allow for rotation, but in some cases, especially when there are bulky substituents, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, so we need a chiral center or some form of stereoisomerism that's not due to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The biphenyl partâ€”each benzene ring has two substituents. Let me think about the structure. The main chain is like O-C-O (from the ester) attached at 2 and 2' positions. And nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Are there any chiral centers here?

No, the central part is probably the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 2', but in a benzene ring, the positions are relative. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other on each ring. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. Does that mean the molecule is symmetrical along the central axis?

Wait, but the substituents on each ring are 2,2'-dicarboxylate and 6,6'-dinitro. So, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group at opposite positions. So perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. But if the substituents aren't all the same, maybe not. Wait, the substituents on each ring are nitro and ester groups at 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if you have a mirror plane down the central bond, would the substituents mirror each other? If so, the molecule might not have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl structure itself can lead to isomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have cis and trans isomerism based on the rotation around the central bond. But that's a form of stereoisomerism called geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about the presence of a chiral center, which requires a carbon with four different substituents.

So, in this compound, does any carbon have four different groups attached? Looking at the ester groups: the ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to the oxygen of the ester and the oxygen from the benzene ring. Wait, no, the substituents on the benzene are the ester groups and nitro groups. The ester groups are O-CO-OCH3 or something.

Wait, perhaps the carbons attached to the benzene are not chiral centers. I don't think this compound has any chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism here. Or wait, perhaps the central carbon between the two benzene rings? No, that's part of the biphenyl structure, which is a single bond and can rotate. So, I think this compound doesn't have optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is OMe-O-C-O-CH(CH3)OH? Wait, no. Let me write the structure. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the acid. Wait 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is then:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)CH2-

So, the structure is a chiral center at the CH2OH group. Wait, wait, no. The carbon chain is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to what?

Let me break it down: the 2-hydroxypropanoate ester would have a structure like:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2-COO-OCH3
- Two other CH2 groups?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the molecule. The carboxylate group is at the end. So, the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2-OH. So, the structure is O-C-OCH3 is attached to a CH2CH2OH group. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) has four substituents: two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the central carbon is CH(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- OH group,
- CH2COOCH3 group,
- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (CH2OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me count the substituents on the central carbon.

The central carbon is CH2OH. So, the substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (the carbons on either side). Wait, no, because the central carbon is connected to CH2 on both ends?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH.

So, the central carbons are the two CH2 groups. The carbonyl is at the end. So, the carboxylate group is at the end, connected to a methyl ester. The two CH2 groups are between the carboxylate and the hydroxyl.

Wait, but then the central CH2 would be connected to the carboxylate, another CH2, and two H's. No, that doesn't give a chiral center. Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure would be:

The central carbon (second carbon) would have:

- COOCH3 (from the carboxylate),
- OH,
- two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because it's propanoate, so the chain is three carbons. So:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So, the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups (the left and right ones). Wait, no, it's connected to CH2 on one side and CH2COOCH3 on the other. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH) is attached to a CH2 which is attached to COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon is the CH2OH. It's connected to:

- OH,
- CH2 (which leads to the COOCH3),
- and two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let me write it as:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central CH2 is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two more CH2 groups? No, that doesn't make sense because it's a three-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at the end, then CH2, then CH(OH), then another CH2?

No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let's imagine the structure. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, because propanoate is three carbons.

Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a chain leading to the ester group),
- two CH2 groups (the adjacent carbons).

Wait, no. The central carbon is the one attached to the OH. Let me look at its four substituents:

1. OH group,
2. CH2COOCH3 (the next carbon in the chain),
3. two H's? No, because that would only be two substituents. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- another CH2 (from the adjacent carbon),
- and a hydrogen. Wait, that would make four substituents, but if it's attached to a CH2, that's a CH2 group, not a CH2-CH2. Maybe I'm getting tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl, and it's connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (left and right). No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to assign the structure as:

The ester is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH2OH) is attached to:

- OH group,
- the CH2 group leading to the COOCH3,
- and two more CH2 groups? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon is CH(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, for the central carbon, the substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the central carbon is the one with the CH2OH. So, the substituents are:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- and the CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, that's four groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. But wait, the two CH2 groups are from the same carbon? No, because the CH2 groups are part of the chain. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2- (towards the COOCH3),
- CH2- (towards the other end),
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would make three substituents plus hydrogen. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of whether this compound has a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (the CH2OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2- (to the COOCH3),
- two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think about the actual structure.

The molecule is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the first CH2) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2- (leading to the COOCH3 group),
- and two H's.

Wait, that can't be because that would give only three substituents. So, perhaps the central carbon is the one attached to OH, and it's connected to:

- OH,
- CH2- (towards the COOCH3),
- and two CH2 groups on either side? No, perhaps I'm not seeing it right.

Wait, maybe the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2-CH2-OH group. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is at the end, connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2 with OH.

So, the two CH2 groups: the first CH2 is attached to the COOCH3, the second CH2 is attached to the OH.

So, the central carbon (the second CH2) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

That gives only three substituents and a hydrogen. So, that carbon is CH2OH, which is a secondary carbon with two H's, so it can't be a chiral center. Hmm, so perhaps this molecule doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but that can't be right. What if the structure is different? Let me think again. Maybe it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then, when esterified, it becomes CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with the OH) would have:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and one more substituent, which would be a hydrogen.

Wait, that gives four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, yes, that's a chiral center! So, this compound would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, I'm getting confused between 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and 3-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, positions are 1, 2, 3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH2OH.

So, the ester would be:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

So, the central carbon (the one in the middle, CH2-) would have:

- CH2COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- and two H's.

So, substituents are CH2COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. That's only three distinct groups and a H, so it's not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism. Wait, but am I getting this right?

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups. Let's look at the structure.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is the middle CH2. So, substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

That's only three substituents (H, H, CH2COOCH3, OH). So, it's a -CH2- group, not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think about the IUPAC name.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the parent acid is propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3.

So, the molecule becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central CH2 is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

No, that's only three substituents, so the carbon can't be chiral. So, no optical isomerism here. Hmm, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misnaming the compound. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe it's methyl (2R)-hydroxypropanoate? But the question doesn't specify the configuration, so it's about whether the possibility exists.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is a chiral center. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on and come back later.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So, it's two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. Structure: Ar-CO-Ar. The ketone group is in the center, connected to two phenyl groups.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen (C=O) and connected to two benzene rings. So, the substituents are two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a lone pair (but that's not a substituent). Wait, the carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a spÂ² hybridized carbon. So, it has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the carbonyl.

But wait, spÂ² carbons can't be chiral because they don't have four substituents. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dihydroxy compound with a double bond. Its structure is (E)-butenedioic acid. The diesters would have two ester groups on either end.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumerate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is:

HOOCC=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, not exactly. The structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H for maleic acid. But fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So, the molecule is:

MeO-CO-CH=CH-CO-O-Me.

So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 group.

Does this compound exhibit optical isomerism? Well, the double bond is in the middle, and each end has a COOCH3 group. Are the substituents on each end the same? Yes, each is COOCH3.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is symmetrical. Because the two ends are identical. So, even though there's a double bond, the molecule is symmetrical. So, can it show geometric isomerism?

Wait, geometric isomerism (cis/trans) is possible if substituents on each double bond are different. But in this case, each end of the double bond has the same substituent (COOCH3). So, for fumarate, which is the (E) isomer, the groups are on opposite sides, but because the substituents are the same on each end, the molecule might not have geometric isomerism.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH when in the fumarate form? No, noâ€”fumarate is the trans form of maleic acid. Wait, let's clarify: maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. But in this case, the substituents on each end are same (COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, no. Let's think: the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOOCH3. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the substituents on each double bond are the same (COOCH3). So, the molecule doesn't have geometric isomerism because the substituents are the same on both sides. So, no cis or trans isomerism.

But wait, the question is about optical isomerism. Does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's check. The carbons in the ester groups are attached to OCH3, O, and carbonyl groups. The central carbons are part of the double bond, so they are spÂ² hybridized and not chiral centers. So, no chiral centers here. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but since the substituents on each end are same, perhaps it can't have geometric isomerism. So, no.

Wait, but wait another thing. Fumarate is a di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans dihydroxy acid. So, the double bond is trans. So, when you esterify it, the substituents are on opposite sides. But because each substituent is the same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, perhaps it doesnâ€™t have any geometric isomerism either.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because the positions of the substituents are different. Hmm, no, because each end is COOCH3. So, the molecule is symmetrical. So, in that case, perhaps the two substituents on each end are same, so no geometric isomerism.

But wait, that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought fumarate was a trans-diepoxide. Or no, fumarate is the trans-diesters. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid has a trans double bond, so the diesters would have the two ester groups on opposite sides.

But since each substituent on the double bond is the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, is there any possibility of internal planes of symmetry? If so, then the molecule can't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have enantiomers.

So, dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical along the central plane. So, perhaps it doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. The double bond is in the center, with both ends having COOCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Because of this, any configuration would have a mirror image, making the molecule achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is an example of a diastereomer, but not enantiomers. Or is it? I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that if the substituents on both ends are the same, the molecule can't have enantiomers, so no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about this. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the substituents on the double bond make it have a chiral center. But no, because the substituents are the same on each carbon.

So, looking back to each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Earlier confusion. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2OH, which is attached to two CH2 groups, COOCH3, and OH. No, that's only three substituents, so no chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another angle: the IUPAC name. 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, the ester group is on the third carbon.

So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The ester is on the third carbon, the OH is on the second. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2OH. Substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (previous and next), but that can't be because the next is a COO group.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- COOCH3 (through a CH2),
- and two CH2 groups. No, that still doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents. Let me think: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, that would give four substituents: CH3, H, COOCH3, OH. So, yes, that's a chiral center! Oh, so that would imply that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps I was wrong in that assessment.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which has a chiral center at the second carbon. So, in that case, yes, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but waitâ€”the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, but that structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon is CH2OH, which is connected to two CH2 groups (one on each side), a COOCH3, and an OH. But that gives only three substituents, as the CH2 groups would be same on both sides.

Wait, but what if the structure is actually CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate? No, because propanoate is three carbons, so that would be:

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: OH,

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, which is 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- and another H?

Wait, no, that would be for 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 - C(OH)H - CH3.

Thus, the central carbon is attached to four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. So, that's a chiral center. Thus, this compound would have optical isomerism.

So, that means compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was different, but perhaps I made a mistake. So, in that case, compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Now, going back to the four compounds:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes, optical isomerism.

3. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Let me think again. Structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Are there any chiral centers? The two middle carbons are part of the double bond, so they're spÂ² hybridized and can't be chiral centers. The other carbons are attached to ester groups, which are OMe, O, and carbonyl. So, no chiral centers here.

But wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and the substituents on each end are same. So, no geometric isomerism as well. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, when esterified, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, but since each substituent is same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4: No, because 1 and 4 don't.

Option B) 3 and 4: No.

Option C) 2 and3: No, because 3 doesn't.

Option D) 1 and 2: No, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, according to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. So, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made an error in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate the first compound.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: a biphenyl with nitro groups at 6 and 6', and ester groups at 2 and 2'. Each ring has nitro and ester groups opposite each other.

Does this compound have a chiral center? The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, which are para on each ring.

The molecule might have a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents are opposite each other, the molecule could be symmetrical along the central bond. So, no chiral centers.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the arrangement of substituents around the central bond could lead to a chiral arrangement. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical, but in this case, it's 2,2'- and 6,6'-substituted, making the molecule symmetrical.

So, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, so that leaves me with only compound 2 having optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4, dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate structure: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

The molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. But wait, what if the molecule is not symmetrical? Let me think about the actual structure.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the di-ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But since each substituent is same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical along the central plane. So, it's not chiral.

So, no optical isomerism for 4.

Hmm, that leaves me with only compound 2 having optical isomerism. But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). But according to my analysis, 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this structure, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since the groups on each carbon are same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

So, according to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let me list each compound and decide.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, has a chiral center. Optical isomerism exists.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 â†’ No, because 1 and 4 don't.

B) 3,4 â†’ No.

C) 2,3 â†’ No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1,2 â†’ No, because 1 doesn't.

So, none of the options match. Hmm, that suggests perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the compounds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

dimethyl fumarate: Structure is (Z)- or (E)- di-ester. Wait, fumarate is the (E) isomer. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since both substituents are same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate compound 4. Let me think about the structure again.

If the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. If it's asymmetrical, then it can have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ends are same: COOCH3 on each end. So, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again about its structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon is CH2(OH), connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH2OH. It's connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (the adjacent carbons). But that would be three substituents, not four, so no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think: maybe the ester is on the same carbon as the OH. So, the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and H.

So, four different substituents â†’ chiral center â†’ optical isomerism.

Wait, but that structure would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the name would be correct.

So, in this structure, the central carbon is a chiral center. So, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

If that's the case, none of the options match. But the options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think of the other compounds again.

Looking at compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the substituents on each end are same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Since the substituents are same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, what if the substituents are not same? No, in dimethyl fumarate, it's MeOOC and COOCH3 on each end, but wait, no, it's the same on both ends: MeOOC on the left and MeOOC on the right. So, same substituents.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let me look for another compound that could have optical isomerism.

What about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester at opposite positions.

Wait, but in biphenyl systems, sometimes the arrangement can lead to a chiral center if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. But in this case, the substituents are symmetrically placed (2 and 6 are para), making the molecule symmetrical.

But wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are mirror images, the molecule would be achiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps another way: think about which compounds can have a chiral center.

Looking at compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. No chiral centers.

Compound 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers.

Compound 1: no chiral centers.

So, only compound 2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think about fumarate again.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, when you have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, but since each is same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the conclusion is only compound 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). But 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4.

Wait, is dimethyl fumarate a meso compound?

Meso compounds are compounds that have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides, but each is same. So, is the molecule a meso compound?

Wait, in meso compounds, the stereocenters are present, but the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two central carbons are double-bonded and spÂ² hybridized, so not chiral centers. So, no, it's not a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let's go back to the question.

The compounds that show optical isomerism are those with a chiral center. So, I need to find which of the four have a chiral center.

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only 2.

Thus, according to the options, none of them match. But perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps in compound 4, the substituents are different. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: each end is COOCH3. So, same substituents. So, no.

Wait, is there any other possibility?

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: if the substituents on the double bond are different, then the molecule could have geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on the same side, making it the cis isomer. But in that case, the substituents are same on each end, so the molecule is symmetrical. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are different, making it possible for geometric isomerism. But in this case, the substituents are same, so no.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me count the options.

The options provided are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

If only 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The substituents on each CH are same (COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, no.

Perhaps I should think that only compound 4 has optical isomerism. Wait, why?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the substituents are not same. Wait, no, it's the same on both ends.

Hmm.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on my analysis, the correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is asymmetrical, then there's a chiral center.

But in this compound, each ring has nitro and ester groups opposite each other, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis, but that doesn't create optical isomerism.

I think I'm stuck, but based on my thorough analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of compound 2. Maybe the hydroxyl is on a different carbon.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is CH2OH, which is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

No, that makes only three substituents, so it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group.

Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that's a chiral center.

Ah, so perhaps I was correct the first time. So, compound 2 does have a chiral center.

Thus, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another possibility.

Wait, another way: maybe the analysis of compound 4 is wrong. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

The molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

In that case, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities in compound 4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are different, making it a meso compound.

Wait, for example, if the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

But that's not fumarate, that's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center in the molecule, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism, but the question specifically asks about optical isomerism.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer should be option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 also has optical isomerism.

Wait, but I just don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, if the substituents are not symmetrical, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para. So, the molecule is symmetrical, hence no optical isomerism.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is an example of a diastereomer, but not an enantiomer. So, perhaps it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that includes only 2, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compounds 1,2,4.

But I don't think compound 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 1.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is asymmetrical.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para. Thus, the molecule is symmetrical.

So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I think the correct answer is only compound 2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the substituents in compound 4.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are COOCH3 on each end, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound is 2, but the options don't include that.

Hmm, perhaps the question's correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But after this long thought process, I think the only correct option is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps in the first compound, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is asymmetric, leading to optical isomerism.

But in that case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para, making the molecule symmetrical.

So, I think I'm stuck.

In conclusion, after much thought, I think the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups). Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), which requires chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6,6' positions and ester groups at the 2,2' positions. The molecule is symmetrical due to the para arrangement of substituents on each ring. Since there is no chiral center, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-C(OH)H-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, COOCHâ‚ƒ, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)â‚‚C=O, where Ph is a phenyl group. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O) and is spÂ² hybridized. Since spÂ² carbons cannot be chiral, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCHâ‚ƒ)â‚‚. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each end of the double bond are identical (COOCHâ‚ƒ groups). Although the double bond allows for geometric isomerism (cis/trans), the symmetry of the molecule prevents optical isomerism. There are no chiral centers, so this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the reasoning provided, the closest match to the intended answer appears to be **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, though compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
