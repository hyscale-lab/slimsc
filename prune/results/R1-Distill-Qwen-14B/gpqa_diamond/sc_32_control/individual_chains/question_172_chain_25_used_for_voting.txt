Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means that each part of the star's photosphere is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. So, the physics here must be related to blackbody radiation or maybe the excitation of atoms in the star.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I'm trying to recall what determines the excitation of atoms in a star. Oh, right! The excitation depends on the temperature of the photosphere. The higher the temperature, the more energy the atoms have, so the higher the probability of being in higher energy states.

Oh wait, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution gives the number of particles in a particular energy state relative to a reference state. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote the energy levels as E_1 and E_2, with E_1 being the higher one. So, the excitation in the higher level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, wait. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy levels. Or wait, actually, the question says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so E_1 - E_2 is the same (1.38e-23 J) for both. 

So, the number of atoms in the higher energy level is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Because the higher energy level is less populated, the ratio n_upper / n_lower is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, but in our case, the higher level is more populated in star_1. So, the ratio for star_1 is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations. Let me think. Let's say the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio.

So, (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Hmm, but what's the exact setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is such that n_upper in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but wait, but we should consider the same energy level. So, perhaps it's that the ratio n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or, that the population in the excited state is twice as high in star_1 as star_2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rephrase. The question states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the number of atoms in the excited state (higher energy level) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Assuming that the atoms are in LTE, the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1, the ratio is:

n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2:

n_upper_2 / n_lower_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that n_upper_1 = 2 * n_upper_2 (assuming the same lower level population in both stars, but wait, the lower level population depends on the number of available states as well. Hmm, but perhaps for the same element, the number of lower states is similar, but the problem might be considering the ratio of the upper to lower level populations in each star.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's about the excitation. So, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the upper to lower level. So, for star_1, the excitation is (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2). Because star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's.

So, using the Boltzmann equation:

(n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
(n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, setting up the equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Because the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write this equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2)

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let's compute that.

Wait, another approach: Let me bring everything to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively,

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because 1/T2 is (T1)/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 is (T2)/(T1 T2), so their difference is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the left-hand side is (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the temperatures.

But looking at the options, they involve ln(2) equal to something. Let's see.

Let me consider the equation:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, that's the same as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. The options involve ln(2) on the left, so perhaps I should solve for (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) in terms of ln(2).

Wait, but the options don't involve any of the other constants like k or ΔE. So perhaps the equation is to be rearranged into the form given in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) as (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, let me re-express the equation.

From the original equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Let me factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln(2))/ ΔE

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. I wonder if that's relevant, but perhaps not, because the options don't involve numbers, just expressions with T1 and T2.

Wait, the question is about which equation is correct for the effective temperatures. So, the equation must involve ln(2) on one side and a ratio of temperatures on the other.

Wait, from the equation I derived:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (k ln(2))/ΔE

But in the options, ln(2) is on the left-hand side. So perhaps I should rearrange the equation.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, so:

ln(2) = [ ΔE (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 )

But wait, none of the options directly show this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Option C is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 which doesn't match.

Options A and B don't seem to fit either.

Wait, but this equation involves k and ΔE. But the question's options don't have any other variables except temperatures, so perhaps we're supposed to manipulate the equation into a form that matches one of the options, assuming that ΔE and k are known or can be factored out.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the ratio of excitation is the same as the population ratio. So, if star_1 has twice the excitation, then (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2 (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2 )

Which would lead us to the equation I had earlier.

But perhaps I should express the ratio in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the ratio (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) in terms of ln(2).

Wait, let me go back to the equation.

We have:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * ΔE ] / ( k T1 T2 )

But since the options don't have ΔE or k, perhaps this is not the way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, another approach: Let's express the ratio of the populations.

The ratio between star_1 and star_2 is:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = 2.

So,

[ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )) ) = 2

Take ln both sides:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, which is the same as before.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = (k ln(2)) / (ΔE)

But the question asks for an equation involving T1 and T2, and the options don't include k or ΔE. So perhaps the problem is set up in a way that allows us to cancel some terms.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using the ratio of the excitation temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal of temperatures.

Wait, let me define x = 1/T1 and y =1/T2. Then,

y - x = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

Which can be written as,

y - x = C, where C is a constant (C= k ln(2)/ΔE )

But without knowing the value of C, I can't proceed further. So perhaps the options are in terms of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is equal to (y - x).

Wait, because:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = y - x.

So, the equation becomes:

y - x = C.

Which is the same as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = C.

But the question's equation is ln(2) equals something. So perhaps the equation is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * (ΔE)/(k )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So maybe the problem is assuming that the energy difference ΔE is known and can be substituted with a value that would make the equation fit the options.

Wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute k:

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Wait a minute, that's the same as the given ΔE. Because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, substituting:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So, k=ΔE / (1 K) → because 1.38e-23 J =k * 1 K.

So,

ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But since ΔE =k (as we saw), this is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / (k) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes! So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation of atoms is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature of the system. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and it is stated that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

The Boltzmann distribution is expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{upper}} \) and \( n_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
