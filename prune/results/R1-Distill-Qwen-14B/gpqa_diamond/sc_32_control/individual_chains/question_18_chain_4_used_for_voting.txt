Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I think the mass might not directly affect the ratio we're looking for, which is about elemental abundances. The key data is the [X/Y] abundances.

The given data for the stars are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2, maybe? Or perhaps the ratio [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2], but I think it's the ratio of the abundances relative to hydrogen. Let me clarify.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon. Oh, wait, do I need to determine [Si/H] for each star?

Because the question gives [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star. Let's think about each star.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If it's zero, they're the same.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → which means nSi/nFe = 10^(0.3) times (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Since [Fe/H]_1 =0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun. So, nFe/nH = (Fe/H)_sun → which is 3.16e-5.

So, nFe in Star_1 is same as in Sun relative to H. So, nSi/nH in Star_1 is (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH).

nSi/nFe is 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but what is (nSi/nFe)_sun? Since the Sun's [Si/Fe] is [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the given data is for the Sun's photosphere: nFe and nMg, but what about nSi?

Wait, the Sun's data given is nFe and nMg relative to H. So, I don't have the solar [Si/Fe] value. But perhaps I can compute it using the given data. Or maybe I have to make an assumption.

Wait, maybe I can use the given data for Star_2 as well, but let's focus on Star_1 first.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

So, (nFe)_1 = same as Sun's nFe.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but I don't know (nSi/nFe)_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Fe/H]_1 and [Si/Fe]_1.

Because [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

Wait, is that correct? Because [X/H] = log(nX/nH), and [X/Y] = log(nX/nY).

So, [X/H] = [Y/H] + [X/Y].

Yes! Because [X/H] = [Y/H] + [X/Y].

So for Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

They give [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Wait, let's compute [Si/H]_2.

We can write [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2.

Because [Mg/H] = [Si/H] + [Mg/Si].

So, 0 = [Si/H]_2 + 0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but wait. Let me check:

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3, so log(nMg/nSi) = 0.3 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Hmm, wait no, the [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, wait. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances, normalized to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

So, nMg/nSi in Star_2 is 10^{0.3} times that of the Sun.

But how does that relate to [Mg/H]_2?

[Mg/H]_2 is 0, same as Sun's [Mg/H], which is log(nMg/nH)_2 - log(nMg/nH)_sun = 0 → nMg/nH in Star_2 is same as Sun.

So, for Star_2, nMg/nH = same as Sun.

But I need [Si/H]_2.

Hmm, perhaps I can express [Si/H] in terms of [Mg/H] and [Mg/Si].

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2.

Because [Mg/H] = [Si/H] + [Mg/Si].

So, 0 = [Si/H]_2 + 0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H] is 0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H] is -0.3.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the Sun, [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) = ?

Wait, the Sun's nFe and nMg are given, but what about nSi? Hmm, perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_sun from the given data. Let me see.

Wait, the Sun's data is:

12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH) = log(3.16e-5) → which is indeed -4.496, but the way it's given is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is the same as log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5.

But for Si, the Sun's [Si/H] would be log(nSi/nH). But we don't have that data. Hmm. So perhaps the [X/Y] ratios can be used to find nSi in the Sun.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to. Because when I calculated [Si/H] for Star_1 and Star_2 relative to their own [Fe/H], I might not need the solar [Si/H].

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

So [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 is 0.

[Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 → which is log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.

So, log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

But nMg/nH in Star_2 is same as Sun. So, nMg_2 = nMg_sun * nH_2 / nH_sun.

Wait, but perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.

We need the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which is [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but [Si/H] is a logarithmic scale. So the ratio would be 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Because [X/Y]_A = log(nX_A / nY_A) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun).

But for [Si/H], it's log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) = [Si/H]_A.

So, the ratio of nSi/nH in Star_1 to that in Star_2 is 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Because:

nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, nSi_2/nH_2 =10^{[Si/H]_2} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

So the ratio is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) )= 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Which is 10^{(0.3 - (-0.3))} = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.98, so about 4. So the answer would be option A) ~3.9.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → same Fe/H as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 → 0 +0.3=0.3.

Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2 → 0 = [Si/H]_2 +0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, the ratio is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which is the closest.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between them.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H abundance is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H abundance is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2 → 0 = [Si/H]_2 + 0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)} = 10^{(0.3 - (-0.3))} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is closest to **3.9**.
