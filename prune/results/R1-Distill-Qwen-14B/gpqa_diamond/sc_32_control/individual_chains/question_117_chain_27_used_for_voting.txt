Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question is asking which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the compound isn't superimposable on its mirror image. Alternatively, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral and thus won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, there are four compounds listed, and I need to check each for optical isomerism.

Let's start with the first one: 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl compounds can have different isomerism based on their substituents. The [1,1'-biphenyl] suggests that the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2,2' positions and 6,6' positions. So, the substituents are at opposite ends of the biphenyl. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it can have stereoisomers.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or a non-superimposable mirror image. Alternatively, if it's a meso compound, it won't have optical isomerism. Let me visualize this structure. The substituents are at 2 and 2' for the carboxylate groups and 6 and 6' for nitro groups. So, each benzene ring has two substituents. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are in symmetric positions, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across a plane, the molecule would be achiral. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: the biphenyl rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 2' as well as 6 and 6'. So, each ring has two groups: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Are these positions symmetric?

Wait, the substituents on each ring are at the para position relative to each other? No, on each benzene ring, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, 2 and 6 are meta to each other on a benzene ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If the substituents are in such a way that each has the same arrangement, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. Or is it?

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system can have a twist, making the molecule chiral. For example, if the two rings are connected in a way that allows for a chiral axis or center. Oh wait, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then no.

Wait, perhaps this compound is a type of diastereomer. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of cis and trans isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or a chiral axis. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl system itself doesn't have a chiral center, but the substituents could create one.

Wait, maybe each benzene ring is attached to ester groups, which are OMe (dimethyl esters). So, the structure would be each benzene ring with a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, substituents at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). So, each ring has two substituents that are meta to each other. Do these substituents lead to the molecule having a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl group's substituents are at positions that don't allow a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). So, substituents are in positions that are across from each other (since 2 and 6 are across on a benzene ring). So each ring has substituents that are opposite each other.

If the substituents on both rings are the same, then perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are arranged symmetrically across the biphenyl axis. Wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl group is such that the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the whole molecule chiral. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move to another compound and come back.

Compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH)CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2COOCH3? Hmm, wait no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH2OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, so the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, the first carbon (from the COO-) is the alpha carbon, then the next is beta, then gamma. So 2-hydroxy would be on the beta carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the carboxylic acid is at the end, so the chain is CH2CH2COOH. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, which is the second carbon from the COOH. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbons are arranged as:

COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl), then the next is the second carbon (with OH), then the third is CH3. Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, the structure could be CH2CH(OH)CH2COOCH3. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether this compound has a chiral center. The molecule would have a carbon attached to four different groups if it's a chiral center. Let's see.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a methyl group (from the adjacent CH2),
- a carbonyl group (from the COOCH3),
and the fourth group is another CH2 group?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write it out:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carboxy methyl ester),
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the COOH becomes OCH3. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let's look for chiral centers. The central carbon (CH2) would have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, wait. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 (which is COOCH3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the carbon in the middle (CH2) is between the CH2(OH) and the COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, which would have two identical groups: two CH2 groups. No, wait, the middle carbon is connected to CH2(OH) on one side and CH2COOCH3 on the other. Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent CH group (CH3-CH(OH)-...).

Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is the CH(OH), which is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (the one from CH3). So, the four groups would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the other CH from CH3-CH(OH)-.

Wait, no, because in that case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 on one side,
- the COOCH3 on the other,
- OH,
- and the other CH from the adjacent CH3.

Wait, that would make the four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (as in CH2). Wait, no. Let me count: the central carbon (CH(OH)) has four substituents:

1. The CH3 group (from CH3-CH(OH)-)
2. The OH group
3. The COOCH3 group (from -CH(OH)-COOCH3)
4. The adjacent CH2 group, but wait, that can't be because in this structure, it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2? No, wait, the adjacent is a single carbon as well. I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately drawn as:

    O
    ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is CH2, and the structure is more like CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, with two CH2 groups attached. If that's the case, the central carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups, so it's not a chiral center. Because a chiral center must have four different substituents.

Wait, in the structure CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2 attached to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2 (from the next carbon),
- and two CH2 groups. So no, that's not a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think differently. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Alternatively, if it's a meso compound, it won't have optical isomers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think about the structure again. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the OH. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon is the CH(OH). It's connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the next carbon (CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3).

Wait, the next carbon is another CH, so the substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. COOCH3,
3. OH,
4. and the CH from the adjacent carbon (which is another CH3 group? Or is it another CH group?)

Wait, in this structure, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is a CH group, but perhaps that's the same as another group). Hmm, no, because if the adjacent carbon is CH3, then maybe the substituents are CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. Wait, that would make it two CH3 groups, so the substituents are not all different.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to write the correct structure. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 between the OH and COOCH3.

So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So each CH2 has two H's. So the substituents on the central carbon are:

- two H's,
- a CH2OH group,
- a CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, because each CH2 group is attached to two H's. So the central carbon has:

- two H's,
- a CH2OH group,
- a CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be right. Each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon's substituents are:

- two H's,
- a CH2OH,
- a CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's only three substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about whether this molecule has a chiral center.

In CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- two H's,
- a CH2OH group,
- a CH2COOCH3 group.

So, four substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. But since two substituents are H's, the other two are different. So the groups are CH2OH and CH2COOCH3, plus two H's. So the substituents are not all different. Therefore, the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So this compound doesn't have a chiral center and thus can't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another way: the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)
2: CH2 (connected to 1 and 3)
3: COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached. So, the substituents on C2 are two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and two H's. So, the substituents are same on both sides, which means C2 is not a chiral center. So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

So, compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the structure were different, like if it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon would be CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from CH3-CH(OH)).

Wait, in that case, the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Moving on, compound 3 is benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone (C=O). The central carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two benzene rings. So, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (O), and what else? The central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond. Wait, no. The central carbon is part of a ketone, so it's Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents are two phenyl groups and O. But wait, a carbon can't have three bonds without some kind of hybridization. Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two R groups. So in benzophenone, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and has a double bond to O. So, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

Now, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have chirality. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized, and thus trigonal planar. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents, and be tetrahedral. So, if the carbonyl carbon is sp2, it can't have four substituents; it's already double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, in benzophenone, the carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and that's it. So, no chiral centers here. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and its dimethyl ester would be the diethyl ester of that.

Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Wait, no, actually, maleic acid is (Z), and fumaric acid is (E). So, dimethyl fumarate would be the ester of fumaric acid, so the structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but arranged in the trans configuration.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, fumarate is a trans-dioic acid. So the structure is two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. Now, in terms of optical isomerism, do these structures exhibit any?

Wait, but fumarate is a geometric isomer, not an optical isomer. However, when the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side, it can have E and Z isomerism. But optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometry.

Wait, but in this case, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look at the structure. The molecule is two ester groups connected by a double bond. So the structure is CH2-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)-CH2? No, wait. Fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in trans configuration. No, wait, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

In that structure, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the carbons in the double bond are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each end of the double bond has a CH group attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, so each of those CH groups is connected to:

- a double bond to the other CH,
- a COOCH3 group,
- and two hydrogens.

So each of these CH groups is attached to three different groups: COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. Wait, but a double bond is a substituent, but for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. Each of these CH groups is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the double bond.

But wait, in a double bond, the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides (E or Z), but that's geometric isomerism, not optical.

Alternatively, perhaps each of these CH groups is connected to COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. That would make three substituents, but a carbon in a double bond is actually sp2 hybridized and has three substituents. So, each of these carbons isn't a chiral center because they don't have four different substituents.

Wait, so if the double bond is between two CH groups, each of which has a COOCH3 and two H's, then neither of those carbons is a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: fumarate (E) has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical. So, does it have a plane of symmetry? Yes, the plane that bisects the molecule through the double bond. Hence, the molecule is achiral and won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't be chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is a symmetrical molecule, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's incorrect. No, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each CH is attached to COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond.

Wait, each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent to a carbon). Wait, no, the double bond connects to the other CH. So each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and a double bond to the other CH.

So each of those CH groups has three substituents. So, they can't be chiral centers because a chiral center must have four different groups. Hence, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism except perhaps the first one. Let me reevaluate compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure has two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at the 6 position and a carboxylate ester (dimethyl) at the 2 position.

So, for each benzene ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, which are meta to each other. So, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2.

Now, the biphenyl system can have a certain configuration. The substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to their respective rings. So, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a symmetric fashion relative to their own ring but may lead to an asymmetrical arrangement across the biphenyl.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically across the biphenyl axis, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, in the biphenyl system, when substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents on each ring are in a non-superimposable mirror image arrangement.

So, in this case, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. Are these substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral?

If the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the biphenyl axis, then the molecule may be chiral. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, it could be a meso compound.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a ester at 2. Let me think about the positions. For the first ring (ring A), position 6 is across from position 1 (the point where the biphenyl connects). So, the substituents on ring A are at 2 and 6: 2 is adjacent to the connecting point (1), and 6 is opposite. Similarly, on ring B, substituents are at 2' and 6'. So, ring B's substituents are at 2' (adjacent to connecting point 1') and 6' (opposite).

Now, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the nitro and ester are in a way that creates a chiral axis, then the molecule would exhibit axial chirality.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are aligned in a way that the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that when you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it looks the same, then it's not chiral.

Wait, but each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. So, if I imagine looking at the molecule, the nitro on ring A is opposite the connecting point, and the ester is next to it. Similarly, on ring B, the nitro is opposite the connecting point, and the ester is next to it. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the biphenyl axis.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the two rings are mirror images of each other, leading to a chiral molecule.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident about this. Another way to think about it: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, but the entire molecule has a mirror plane, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that leads to a chiral center elsewhere. But I don't see any chiral centers in the substituents themselves; each substituent is a nitro or an ester group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl itself can have a twist, leading to axial chirality. For example, the two rings can be connected in a way that the substituents are not symmetrical, leading to a chiral axis. If that's the case, then the molecule would exhibit axial chirality and thus optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, I remember that when substituents are in the para positions on each ring of a biphenyl, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, which are meta to each other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the molecule as having two substituents on each ring, and the arrangement leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate would have axial chirality and hence exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. Compound 1: optical isomerism (possibly)
2. Compound 2: no optical isomerism
3. Compound 3: no optical isomerism
4. Compound 4: no optical isomerism (dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, so no chirality)

Wait, but I thought compound 4 has a trans configuration. Wait, no, it's the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. But does it have a plane of symmetry? Yes, because the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of a chiral center elsewhere? I don't think so. So, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back, the question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A) 1,2,4; B) 3,4; C) 2,3; D)1,2.

But according to my analysis, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Did I miss any possibility?

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate this.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. So, the substituents are:

- two H's,
- a CH2OH group,
- a CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, that's three substituents. So, the central carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center because it's only connected to two identical groups (two H's, so same substituent). Therefore, no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the structure were different, say, CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon would be CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon).

In that case, the substituents would be CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2. Are these four different groups?

Wait, CH3 is a methyl group, OH is hydroxyl, COOCH3 is an ester group, and CH2 would be a methylene group. So, yes, four different substituents. That would make the central carbon a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused about the structure. Let me clarify.

The correct IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)propanoate. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-.

Wait, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, connected to two H's, a CH2OH group, and a CH2COOCH3 group. So, that's three substituents, not four. Therefore, the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so that means only compound 1 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1 and 2. But according to my analysis, compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about compound 1 again. Another approach: biphenyl compounds can show optical isomerism if they lack a plane of symmetry. In such cases, they exhibit axial chirality. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it can be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, in each ring, the substituents are meta to each other. Now, on the biphenyl, are the substituents arranged in a symmetrical way?

Wait, the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, on ring A, substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). On ring B, substituents are at 2' (ester) and 6' (nitro). So, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative position, the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a mirror image fashion, the molecule could be achiral. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another way: if you have two substituents on each ring, and they are at meta positions (2 and 6), then the molecule could be chiral. Because the arrangement could prevent a plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and an ester in meta positions. So, the entire molecule would have two nitro groups and two ester groups, arranged in a way that could make the entire structure chiral.

Therefore, compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Compound 1: optical isomerism (probably)
2. Compound 2: no
3. Compound 3: no
4. Compound 4: no

Wait, but according to this, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 1. The options are:

A) 1,2,4
B) 3,4
C) 2,3
D)1,2

Hmmm. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does this molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, it does. The central double bond has a plane of symmetry that bisects it, making the two sides mirror images. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option A is 1,2,4. If compound 2 actually does have a chiral center, then option A would be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH group. Wait, no, the adjacent group would be CH3 as well. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me write it again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon is CH2, with two CH2 groups attached. So, it's not a chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, that leaves only compound 1 as the correct option, but according to the options, no option includes only 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D)1 and 2

Hmm. So, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a symmetrical manner. Let me think: the molecule has two rings connected at 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). For ring A, substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro), which are meta to each other. For ring B, substituents are at 2' (ester) and 6' (nitro), also meta. Now, if the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical across the central axis. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it looks the same, making it achiral.

In that case, compound 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism, leaving no correct options. But that can't be, as the question is expecting one of the options to be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Hence, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. But I don't think so because the double bond would make the carbons sp2 hybridized, not chiral centers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A, B, C, D. From my analysis, only compound 1 has optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that compound 2 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the CH3 group).

Wait, no, the adjacent group is a single CH3. So, the substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and CH2 (from the adjacent CH2 group? No, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), which is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and CH2 (but that's another CH group, not a CH3).

Wait, perhaps in this structure, the substituents are all different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2. So, four different substituents. Therefore, the central carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but in that case, the IUPAC name would be different. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. But if the structure were CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the name would be different. So perhaps I was misnaming the compound.

Wait, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

But perhaps if the structure were CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would be methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate. Then, the central carbon would be a chiral center, and the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism. But the question states it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, not 3-hydroxy.

So, in that case, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Maybe it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again.

If the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are meta, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible, as the question must have a correct option.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that compound 4 is actually a diastereomer, but not a stereoisomer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4.

Wait, another approach: in which cases do esters of fumaric acid exhibit optical isomerism? Fumarate itself is (E), and when it's an ester, does it have any chiral centers? No, because the double bond is trans, and the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but perhaps when the substituents are in a certain configuration, the molecule becomes chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are symmetric, so it's not chiral.

Thus, I'm back to only compound 1 possibly exhibiting optical isomerism. But since none of the options have only 1, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think about the structure again. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Each CH is attached to COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So, each CH is sp2 hybridized, with three substituents. So, no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, after all that, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 1. But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should consider the possibility that only compounds 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought compound 4 is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Let's look for which options include compound 1.

Option A includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1 and 2.

If compound 1 is correct, then the answer would be A or D, depending on whether 2 is correct.

But according to my analysis, 2 isn't correct. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about compound 4. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Each CH is connected to COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So, each CH is sp2 hybridized, with three substituents. So, no chiral centers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. The only option that includes 1 is A and D. If 2 is incorrect, then the only possible correct option would be A if 4 is correct, but I don't think 4 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another thought: if the substituents are on the same side, then the molecule would be Z and might be chiral. But dimethyl fumarate is the E isomer. So, it's trans and symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, I'm back to only compound 1 being correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta. Now, considering the biphenyl, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In this case, the molecule would exhibit axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, going back to the options. The only option that includes 1 is A, D.

But according to my analysis, none of the other compounds (2,3,4) have optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I can't reconcile why 2 and 4 would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another approach: the question says which of the following show optical isomerism. Let me think about each option's reasoning.

Option A: 1,2,4.

So, 1 has optical isomerism (probably correct), 2 doesn't (as discussed), 4 doesn't. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: 3 and 4. Both don't have optical isomerism. So incorrect.

Option C: 2 and 3. Both don't have optical isomerism. Incorrect.

Option D: 1 and 2. 1 has optical isomerism, but 2 doesn't. So incorrect.

So, none of the options seem correct based on my analysis. But that can't be, as I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another possibility: dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Each CH is connected to COOCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is sp2, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 2 does have a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I should look for another way to determine if compound 2 has a chiral center. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached. So, no chiral center.

But if the structure were CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), which has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH (from adjacent CH3). But that structure isn't methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate; that's methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is A (1,2,4) because I was wrong about 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, it wouldn't have optical isomerism. But if it's not a meso compound, perhaps it does. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is (E), which is symmetrical, so it's a meso compound, making it achiral.

So, I think I have to conclude that only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is A, and I made a mistake about compounds 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me imagine it again. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each CH is connected to COOCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is sp2, not a chiral center.

Thus, I think the only correct option is that only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Maybe the structure is such that the central carbon is a chiral center. Let me think again.

If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH group. So, yes, it's a chiral center. But this would be methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate, not 2-hydroxy. So, in this case, the compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

But the question states it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism. So, the correct answer should be option A if I'm mistaken about others, but I'm not. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. I think I've spent enough time on this.
