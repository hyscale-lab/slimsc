Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

So the setup is Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. That's a lot! He's got vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because in electron microscopy, those gas particles can scatter the electrons, right? That reduces image quality and resolution.

But despite the pumps, some gas molecules are still there. Mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So in a vacuum, since there are fewer gas molecules, the mean free path is longer.

Wait, mean free path depends on pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh, right, the formula is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is number density and d is the mean diameter. So lower pressure (n is lower) makes λ longer. So in a vacuum, λ is longer.

But then Mike starts the electron beam and notices something about the mean free path. Now, the mean free path is λ2, which is different from λ1. The temperature is the same, so that factor is constant.

Hmm, why would the mean free path change? Wait, the mean free path could be affected by other factors. Oh, wait, in the case of electron scattering, the gas molecules might be charged. Or the electrons could be interacting with the gas in a different way.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The gas molecules are neutral, right? Because in the ultra-high vacuum, but some remain. So the electrons could cause ionization of the gas molecules. Or, perhaps the gas molecules are interacting with the electrons via Coulomb forces.

Wait, but wait another thing: In electron microscopy, when the electron beam passes through a gas, the electrons can scatter off the gas atoms. The mean free path for the electrons would be different from the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Or is it about the electron scattering? Let me re-read the question.

Oh, wait, the question says Mike observed that the mean free path was no longer λ1; it was λ2. So for the gas molecules, their mean free path changed when the electron beam was on.

That's a bit confusing. Because the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (without any external influence) should depend on their own density, which is determined by pressure and temperature. But if the electron beam introduces something else.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized? Or perhaps causes them to move more, thereby changing the effective pressure or density.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam induces a change in the gas, such as heating it. But the question states that the temperature remained the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: The gas molecules might have been in thermal equilibrium before the beam was on. But when the beam is on, the electrons are moving at a high speed. Could the electrons' motion cause the gas molecules to be excited in a different way?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves isn't changing. But the effective mean free path for the electrons as they pass through the gas is different. But the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules affects the effective mean free path of the electrons, but that's not what's asked.

Wait, the question is about Mike's observation concerning the mean free path. He found that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So he's measuring the mean free path under vacuum (without the electron beam) as λ1, and under the beam as λ2.

Wait, but the mean free path of gas molecules is a property of the gas, not the electrons. So why would the presence of the electron beam cause λ to change?

Hmm. Maybe it's due to gas ionization. If the electrons cause the gas molecules to ionize, the ionized particles (ions) have different cross-sections for scattering. So the mean free path would change.

Wait, but ions have a larger charge, so their cross-section would be different. Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas is more dense or behaves differently.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the number of gas atoms would decrease as some become ions. But wait, in a high vacuum, the electron beam would have a hard time ionizing the gas because the pressure is so low. But perhaps the mean free path is affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be heated, which changes the mean free path. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps when the electrons are moving through the gas, they cause the gas molecules to be excited (like electron scattering), which could increase the effective pressure or change the mean free path.

Or maybe the presence of the electron beam induces a current, causing some sort of electric field that affects the gas.

Hmm. Alternatively, the mean free path in the presence of an electric field might change. But I’m not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path of gas molecules (λ) is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where d is the diameter of the molecules. But if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter might change because ions have different sizes or charge distributions.

Wait, maybe the ionization changes the effective cross-section for collisions. For example, ions may have a larger cross-section because they carry a charge, so the effective d² increases, leading to a smaller mean free path. If d² increases, then λ decreases.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease because some become ions. So n decreases. The mean free path λ increases when n decreases. But if the cross-section for collisions (d²) increases, the mean free path decreases.

So which effect dominates? Let's see: λ is inversely proportional to n and to d squared.

Suppose the ionization causes d² to increase by a factor of k, and n decreases by a factor of m.

So λ would be λ = 1/(√2 (n') π (d')²) ) = 1/(√2 (m n) π (k d²)) ) = (1/(√2 n π d² )) * (1/(m k)) ) = λ1/(m k)

If m and k are greater than 1, then λ would be smaller than λ1.

But wait, m is the fraction of molecules that become ions. If only a small fraction is ionized, then m is small, but the rest are neutral. Wait, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization affects the size of the ions or the way they interact. For example, if gas molecules become positively charged, their effective diameter for collision purposes may be larger because the charge increases the effective size due to electrostatic repulsion. So d' = d * sqrt(k), where k is some factor greater than 1.

If d' is larger, then λ decreases.

So, if the mean free path is λ1 before the beam is on, and during the beam, the gas is ionized, leading to a smaller λ2, then λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Wait, but let's think if there's another possibility. Alternatively, if the electron beam somehow causes the gas to expand, which would lower the pressure, thus increasing the mean free path. But the temperature is the same, so if the volume increases, pressure decreases. But in this setup, the sample compartment's volume is fixed, right? Because Mike designed it with a specific volume. So the volume doesn't change. So if the pressure is the same (as in, the gas hasn't left), then λ would be the same. But wait, Mike found that the mean free path changed, so the pressure must have changed.

Wait, but the question says that the pressure is the same because the mass spectrometer detected the same gas particles. Or perhaps the pressure didn't change, but the mean free path did. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be excited in another way. For example, the gas becomes more rarified (lower pressure) because the electron beam causes gas molecules to leave the compartment. But that seems unlikely in an ultra-high vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence introduces a charge on the gas molecules, making them more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment, which would increase the mean free path. So n decreases, λ increases.

Wait, that would make λ2 > λ1. So in that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. But then looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

So if the presence of the electron beam leads to n decreasing (because gas is being pumped out or sticking to walls), then λ would increase, so λ2 > λ1. But the question says that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but Mike's observation is that it changes. So which scenario is more plausible?

Hmm, perhaps the electron beam creates a current, causing gas molecules to be electrostatically repelled or attracted, which could affect their distribution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be ionized, and those ions could be accelerated away, effectively reducing the number of neutral gas molecules in the compartment. So the effective pressure of neutral gas decreases, which would increase the mean free path (since n is lower).

So if the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, n is lower, so λ is longer. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the question says that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So λ2 is different. But without knowing which way, how can we choose?

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether λ2 is longer or shorter, just that it's changed. So what's causing the change?

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be heated, but the temperature is the same according to the question. So that can't be it.

Wait, let me think about the mean free path formula again. It depends on the number of collisions. Collisions can be between gas molecules (like in the case of gas flow) or between gas molecules and another object.

But in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules may have a different cross-section for collisions. For example, when the electron beam passes through, it's the electrons that are moving, and the gas molecules may not be colliding with each other as much as before.

Wait, but that's not the same as the mean free path of the gas molecules. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules can become charged, and their movement could be influenced by the electric field generated by the beam. This could cause the gas to behave differently, perhaps leading to a change in their mean free path.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to expand or contract, but under the same temperature, that would imply a change in pressure, which would change the mean free path.

Wait, but the sample compartment's volume is fixed, right? So if the temperature remains the same, the pressure would remain the same, so n remains the same. So the mean free path λ1 should remain the same. But Mike's observation says it's changed.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to a different effective pressure or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam induces a small electric field, causing the gas molecules to move more, thus effectively increasing the rate of collisions.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, and the ions are then accelerated by the electric field of the beam, causing them to leave the compartment. So the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, which lowers the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path.

Wait, that would mean λ2 is longer than λ1. So option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

But the question states that the mean free path is no longer λ1. So which is it?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach: think about what the mean free path represents. It's the average distance a molecule travels without colliding with another molecule.

If the electron beam is on, and the gas is ionized, the ions might have a different mean free path. But Mike is talking about the mean free path of the gas molecules (I think), so perhaps the ionization doesn't affect the mean free path much, but the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor.

Wait, alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas to become a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be much longer because the electrons are free to move, but that's more about the electrons' movement rather than the gas molecules.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path because they don't collide as much as neutral molecules. So the mean free path of the ions would be longer. But the question is about the gas molecules, which are now ions. So if the ions have a longer mean free path, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the vacuum state. Then when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. So if the gas is ionized, perhaps λ2 is longer.

But wait, could the electron beam cause the gas to have a higher mean free path? That would mean the answer is A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate of collisions between gas molecules because the electrons cause the gas to be more energetic, but that would require temperature change, which isn't the case.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path is also affected by the speed of the molecules. The mean free path is given by λ = v * τ, where v is the average molecular speed and τ is the mean time between collisions.

If the electron beam somehow increases the speed of the gas molecules without changing the temperature, that would require a change in their kinetic energy. But temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. So if temperature is same, v should be the same.

Hmm. Maybe the electron beam's presence leads to a change in the effective cross-section for collisions. For example, if the gas is ionized, the cross-section could increase because ions have larger effective sizes (due to charge). So the mean free path would decrease.

Wait, let me model this. Suppose each gas molecule has a diameter d. The effective diameter when ionized could be d', which is larger than d because of the charge. So the cross-section is π (d')². So if d' > d, the cross-section is larger, meaning τ (time between collisions) is shorter, so λ = vτ is shorter. So λ2 < λ1.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1, so option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of the possible options again.

The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1

B) λ2=λ1 (so no change, Mike's observation is wrong)

C) λ2< λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

So the answer is either A, C, or D.

Given the scenario, if the electron beam causes ionization, leading to a larger effective diameter, the mean free path would decrease, so λ2 < λ1 → option C.

But wait, another possibility: the electron beam may cause the gas to be pumped out more efficiently, lowering the pressure, which increases the mean free path. But in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But the question states that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but Mike observed that. So I'm not sure which effect is dominant.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to stay in the compartment, leading to higher pressure. But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, another angle: in ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path of electrons is much longer than that of the gas molecules. So the electrons can travel further without scattering. But when the beam is on, the electrons may cause the gas molecules to scatter more, which would change the effective mean free path.

Wait, but the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons'. So perhaps when the electrons are present, the gas molecules have more collisions because they are being hit by electrons, which effectively changes their mean free path.

Wait, but gas molecules colliding with electrons would be a different process. The gas molecules are much heavier, so the electrons would just glance off them, perhaps.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to move in a way that increases their effective collisions, thereby decreasing their mean free path.

Hmm, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate of collisions between gas molecules. How? Maybe the electrons striking the gas molecules transfer momentum, causing them to move faster or change direction, leading to more collisions.

If that's the case, the mean free path would decrease, making λ2 < λ1.

So then the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may have a higher chance of being ionized, leading to fewer neutral gas molecules. So n decreases, which would increase the mean free path. So λ2 would be larger.

But earlier I thought ionization would lead to a larger effective diameter, which would decrease λ. So which effect is stronger?

The mean free path is inversely proportional to n and to d squared. So if n decreases by a factor of m and d increases by a factor of k, λ becomes λ1/(m k).

If m is much larger than k, then λ increases. If k is larger than m, λ decreases.

Which effect dominates?

In the case of ionization, perhaps n (the number of neutral gas molecules) decreases, but the ionized gas may have a larger effective diameter.

So let's say m is, say, 0.5 (half the gas is ionized), and k is 2 (d doubles). Then λ becomes (0.5 * 2) = 1. So λ remains the same. But in reality, the ionization might not be that high.

Alternatively, suppose m is 0.1, and k is 3. Then λ would be (0.1 *3) = 0.3. So λ decreases.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to say. However, in the scenario of the question, Mike accurately calculated λ1 before the beam was turned on. Then, upon turning on the beam, λ2 is different.

Another angle: the mean free path in the absence of the beam is λ1, and the question is about when the beam is on. The beam introduces a source of scattering for the gas molecules. So the gas molecules' mean free path would be shorter because they're colliding more with the electrons in the beam.

Wait, but the gas molecules are in the sample compartment. The electrons are passing through, but the gas molecules are stationary (or moving). So the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules.

So, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can be hit by electrons. That would cause the gas molecules to have more collisions (with electrons), which would effectively reduce their mean free path because they're colliding more often with something else.

So the mean free path of the gas molecules would be determined not just by collisions with other gas molecules but also with the electrons. So the effective λ would be shorter, because the gas molecules are now colliding with the electrons as well.

So the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering events for the gas molecules. Thus, the effective mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To analyze the scenario, we consider the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum of the electron microscope's sample compartment. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path to be λ1 under the vacuum conditions, based on factors like pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The key question is: Why does λ2 differ from λ1, and how does it compare?

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   The mean free path of gas molecules is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} n \pi d^2}
   \]  
   where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(d\) is the effective diameter of the molecules. λ is inversely proportional to both \(n\) and \(d^2\).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is turned on, several factors could influence the mean free path of the gas molecules:  
   - **Ionization**: The electron beam can ionize the gas molecules, converting neutral molecules into charged ions. Ionized particles may have larger effective diameters (\(d'\)) due to their charge, increasing \(d^2\) and thus decreasing λ.  
   - **Reduction in Neutral Molecules**: Ionization reduces the number of neutral gas molecules (\(n\)), which would increase λ. However, this effect is secondary compared to the change in effective diameter.  
   - **Additional Collisions**: The electron beam introduces additional scattering events for the gas molecules, as the electrons in the beam can collide with the gas molecules. This increases the collision rate, effectively reducing the mean free path.

3. **Dominant Effect**:  
   The ionization effect, which increases the effective diameter (\(d'\)) of the gas molecules, is the dominant factor. This increase in \(d^2\) leads to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).

4. **Eliminating Other Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This would require the mean free path to increase significantly, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect and additional collisions caused by the electron beam.  
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This would imply no change in the mean free path, contradicting Mike's observation that λ2 differs from λ1.  
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a slight increase in the mean free path, which is not supported by the scenario.  

Thus, the most plausible conclusion is that the mean free path decreases due to the ionization effect, making \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).

### Final Answer:
The mean free path of the gas molecules decreases when the electron beam is turned on, so \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).
