Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its speed. Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the lifetime. But wait, τ is the mean lifetime, which relates to the decay width Γ. I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ, but I should double-check that.

Wait, Gamma (Γ) is the decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Oh right, Γ = ħ / τ. So τ would be ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I need to calculate the velocity v. Since E_X is the production energy, which is the total energy of the meson. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but when dealing with relativistic particles, E = gamma * m c^2. So gamma would be E / (m c^2). Wait, but the units here are GeV, so I need to make sure about the constants.

The meson's energy E is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So the energy is 8 GeV, which is much higher than the rest mass, so it's definitely moving relativistically. So gamma is E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

To find the velocity v, I need to relate gamma to v. I remember that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So rearranging that, I can solve for v. Let me think: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma²). So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma²). Taking the square root gives v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)).

Plugging in gamma = 6.6667, 1/gamma² is about 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c. That's a high speed, of course, because it's a high-energy particle.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute gamma squared. 6.6667 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is roughly 2.958e8 m/s multiplied by 0.9887, so around 2.92e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, right? Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to handle the units properly here. So, ħ has units of GeV·s when considering energy and time. Wait, let me think in terms of natural units for a moment. In particle physics, people often use ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, ħ in units of GeV·s is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me get the exact value. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So I can write ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV is (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 GeV/(GeV) ) s, because GeV cancels. So yeah, that's 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24. Wait, 20e-25 is 2e-24, so yes.

Now, the lifetime τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32. Let's compute that: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4, which is 0.182/0.32 ≈ 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yep.

Now, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s). Let me compute that. Multiply 2.9661e8 by 2.056875e-24. Let's calculate:

First, 2.9661e8 = 2.9661 × 1e8
2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 × 1e-24

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute this.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322
2.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1688
So total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.1688 = 6.101.

Then, exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.101e-16 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in meters, and the numbers are around 1e-15 or 1e-16.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

2.9661e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.9661 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375. 0.9661 *2.056875 = ?

0.9661 * 2 = 1.9322. 0.9661 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.05505.

So 1.9322 + 0.05505 ≈ 1.98725.

So total 4.11375 + 1.98725 ≈ 6.101.

So 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't exactly any of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma or v.

Wait, let's recheck gamma. Gamma is E/(m c^2), but E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So that's correct. So gamma is 20/3.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the calculation of v. Because when I compute gamma, v is a function of gamma. Let me compute it more accurately.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Compute v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/(400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think, 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775. Because 0.9887 *0.9887: 0.98 *0.98=0.9604, 0.98*0.0087= ~0.008526, 0.0087 *0.98= same, and 0.0087^2 is small. So 0.9887^2 ≈0.9775.

So v ≈ 0.9887c, which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me check that again. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = hbar / (Gamma) = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) *1e-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32: 32 goes into 658.2 20 times (32*20=640), with 18.2 left. 18.2 /32 = 0.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct. Then, v is 0.9887c = 0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.9661 *2.056875 = let's compute accurately.

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375
0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

0.9661 * 2 =1.9322

0.9661 *0.056875= about 0.05505.

Total is 1.9322 +0.05505=1.98725.

So total 4.11375 +1.98725=6.101.

So L ≈6.101e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 5.0223e-16 m and D)4.0655e-16 m. So I'm not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of gamma. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, which would give a more accurate velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate beta (v/c) correctly.

Wait, another approach: The relation between energy, mass, and momentum. E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c².

Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of beta and gamma.

Beta is v/c, and gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So, E = gamma m c².

So, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 )

Wait, m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So (m c² / E ) = 1.2/8 = 0.15.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Which is the same as before. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime. Let me recheck.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = hbar / (Gamma) → tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25.

6.582 /0.32: Let me compute that with more precision.

0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 6.582-6.4=0.182.

0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider natural units where ħc is used. Let me think about that.

Wait, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), but when converting to meters and seconds, I have to account for the units. Maybe I made a mistake in the units for ħ. Let me think.

In natural units, ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm. Hmm, wait, that's a different unit system. So, if I use ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, but perhaps I should use this instead for the calculation. Because the problem is about meters, perhaps using this approach is better.

Wait, so let's try another approach. The lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ/(Gamma). But when using ħ in units of MeV·fm/c, perhaps.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (c). But since c is in fm per second? Wait, no, let me think again.

Alternatively, in units where c=1, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, but when converting to meters and seconds, we need to apply unit conversions.

So, Gamma is 320 MeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

Using ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So tau = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) ) = (197.33 /320 ) fm.

197.33 /320 ≈ 0.616659 fm.

But wait, wait, units: the units would be (MeV·fm) / MeV ) → fm. So tau is 0.616659 fm. But wait, that's in units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm.

But to convert this to seconds, I need to account for the speed of light. Because time is in fm/(c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me think: tau is in seconds. So, when using ħ in units of MeV·fm, I need to express it in terms that can be converted into seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, so I think the initial approach was correct. Let me proceed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, the lifetime tau is 2.056875e-24 s. The velocity is 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = tau * v = 2.056875e-24 s * 2.9661e8 m/s.

Let me compute this again: 2.056875e-24 * 2.9661e8 = (2.056875 * 2.9661) ×1e-24+8 = (6.101) ×1e-16 m.

So 6.101e-16 meters. But the options are 5.0223e-16, 4.0655e-15, etc. So none of the options match. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me think again. Wait, E is the total energy, m is the rest mass. So E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of v.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v is 0.9887c, correct.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the particle's decay width is given in MeV, but I used it as GeV. So, perhaps I should have used 0.32 GeV. Wait, yes, 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV, so that was correct.

Wait, maybe I should check Planck's constant more precisely. ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use more precise value, like 6.582×10^-25 GeV s.

So with tau =6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 → 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in considering that the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma? Wait, no, that's not right. Because beta is v/c, and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, I've read that the mean decay length is L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. Then, the distance is v * lab lifetime = beta c * gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Hmm, that's a different approach. Let me think: the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (tau_0 = hbar / Gamma).

So L = v * gamma tau_0.

But v = beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is hbar/(Gamma).

So putting it all together: L = beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

But beta gamma is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute L using L = (beta gamma c tau_0).

So let's compute beta gamma:

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Gamma is E/(m c²) )=8/1.2=6.6667.

So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈6.5913.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Tau_0 = hbar/(Gamma) = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )=2.056875e-24 s.

So c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 6.5913 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5913 *3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97739e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e9-24 = (4.0655) *1e-15.

Wait, 1.97739 *2.056875 = let's compute that.

Approximately 2 *2=4, but let's do it accurately.

1.97739 *2 = 3.95478.

1.97739 *0.056875 = approx 0.1121.

So total ≈3.95478 +0.1121≈4.06688.

So L ≈4.06688e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Wait, so the correct answer would be option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I forgot to include gamma in the calculation. Earlier I thought L = v tau, but actually, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, so L = v * gamma tau.

So the correct approach is L = beta gamma c tau_0, where tau_0 is hbar/Gamma.

So the correct calculation gives approximately4.066e-15 m, which matches option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic energy relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}
\]

Substituting \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
c \tau_0 = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
