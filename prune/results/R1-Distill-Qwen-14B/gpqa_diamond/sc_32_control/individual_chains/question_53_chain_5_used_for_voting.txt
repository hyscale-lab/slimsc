Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, I'm thinking it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an O-C-O group present. Ester groups typically show strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1, so that's a key clue.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals in total. Let's parse what each part means.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in various positions. If there are two different types of aromatic protons, that suggests the substituents are in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent H. Wait, no, wait. Di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. For example, para would have two sets of equivalent H, each a doublet. Ortho would have more splitting? Or maybe if the substituents are not symmetrical.

Wait, but the aromatic-H have two signals. So, that suggests that the substituents create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So, perhaps they're in para positions. Because para substitution would lead to two equivalent H on each ring position, causing two doublets. Wait, but in para substitution, each H would have two equivalent neighbors, but wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the ring has two sets of equivalent H: the ones next to the substituents and the ones opposite. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent H: the two H adjacent to each substituent (which are equivalent) and the two H meta to each substituent. Wait, maybe. Let me think. Benzene has six H. With two substituents in para positions, the structure would be 1,4-disubstituted. Each substituent would have two adjacent H (ortho) and one para (which is the other substituent). Wait, no, the substituents are in 1 and 4 positions. Then, the H in 2 and 6 positions are adjacent to substituent 1, and the H in 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent 4. And the H in 6 and 2, etc. So, the aromatic H would split into two sets: two H each in ortho and para positions. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two sets of equivalent H. So, for example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the two ortho Hs to substituent 1 are equivalent, and the two ortho Hs to substituent 4 are equivalent. So each substituent has two H adjacent, which are equivalent within their own pair. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic H, each integrating for two H. That fits with the NMR data given.

Next, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Wait, vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear around 5-6 ppm. A doublet suggests each H is next to one other H, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, a doublet would mean each proton is coupled with one neighboring proton. So, perhaps a trans coupling? Or maybe in a conjugated system. The other vinyl H is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a quartet suggests coupling with three protons, but how? Wait, a doublet of quartets might mean the proton is split by two different coupling partners. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group adjacent to a methylene or something else.

Wait, but the problem states that there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So any CH2 would have been detected. Therefore, the substituents probably don't have any methylene (CH2) groups. So maybe the substituents are ester groups, like OCOCH3 or something similar.

Wait, the ester group is present. So an ester has the structure O-C-O, and typically, the carbonyl is adjacent to an oxygen. So, perhaps the di-substituted benzene has two ester groups. But wait, the formula options don't have two esters necessarily. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents. Since the IR shows an ester, let's think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-R, and another substituent could be another group.

Alternatively, perhaps both substituents are ester groups. But let me think about the NMR data. The two substituents would influence the environment of the aromatic protons.

Wait, but the substituents are attached to the benzene ring, and the other parts of the molecule (like the ester) will have their own protons. Let's look at the other NMR signals.

The NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different CH3 groups? Each integrating for a certain number of H. For example, maybe an ester group with a CH3 attached to the oxygen, and another CH3 from somewhere else, maybe a vinyl group attached to a CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring are likely an ester and a vinyl group. Because the ester has the IR peak, and the vinyl has the specific NMR signals.

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. A vinyl group, like CH2=CH- something, but wait, if it's a trans double bond, the Hs would be a doublet. Hmm, perhaps it's part of an ester. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), but no, wait, esters are O-CO-R. So, maybe the substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-CH2CH3), but that's an ethyl ester, which would have CH2CH3 groups. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that can't be right. So, maybe the substituent is a methyl ester, O-CO-CH3. That would give a CH3 group in the ester, which would show up as a singlet in the NMR (since the CH3 is attached to an electronegative atom, but in an ester, the CH3 is usually a triplet if adjacent to an O, but wait, in methyl esters like OMeCO-, the CH3 is usually a singlet because there's no splitting. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, in the NMR, there are two CH3 signals. So two different CH3 groups. And no CH2 signals. So possible sources for CH3 groups: one from an ester (like O-CO-CH3) and another from a vinyl group, but wait, vinyl groups are CH2=CH-, but that would have CH2, which we don't see. Hmm, so maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to another group that has a CH3, like a CH2 group, but that would have CH2 signals, which aren't present. Hmm, perhaps another possibility.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a methoxy group (OCH3). But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the OCH3, and the ester's R group would have its own signals. But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So if the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and OCH3, then each would contribute a CH3. So that would give two CH3 signals. But let me think about the substitution pattern.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents: one ester and one methoxy? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is a vinyl group with a CH3 elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-R) and a vinyl group, but how would that tie into the CH3 groups? Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COOR, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where the CH3 is part of a geminal group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents include a propyl group or something else.

Wait, let's try to structure this. The aromatic ring has two substituents. Each substituent adds certain groups. Let's think about the substituents.

If one substituent is an ester group, say O-CO-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. So, for example, the structure could be something like:

Ph-O-CO-R and Ph-CH2-CH2- something, but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a ketone? No, the IR shows ester, not ketone.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups. But that would require more oxygens, which the formula may not have.

Wait, looking at the options, the formula is C11H12O2, etc. Let's think about the molecular formula.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene, so benzene has 6 carbons. Each substituent would add to the count.

Assuming each substituent is a group adding a certain number of carbons. Let's say the substituents are an ester group (like O-CO-R) and another group.

Wait, if one substituent is an ester, such as O-CO-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps. Let me think. Let's say the substituents are -O-CO-R and -CH2CH2- something, but again, that would involve CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is part of a ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxy group (OCH3) and an ester group (like O-CO-R). Wait, but that would require more oxygens. Let's see.

Wait, the formula options have two oxygen atoms. So the molecule has two oxygen atoms.

If the substituents are an ester (O-CO-R) and another group (like OCH3), that would add two oxygen atoms, which fits. But then, each substituent would contribute: O from ester, O from methoxy. Wait, but the ester has two oxygens: O-CO-O-R. No, wait, no: ester is O-CO-R, so one oxygen in the ester group. Wait, no, the ester functional group is O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no. An ester's structure is R-O-CO-R', so the oxygen count is two: one from the ether oxygen and one from the carbonyl. Wait no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So that's two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So if one substituent is an ester, that accounts for two oxygens. But the molecular formula has only two oxygens, so the other substituent cannot have any oxygen. So the other substituent must be a group without oxygen.

So, substituents are an ester (O-CO-R) and another group without O.

Wait, but the IR only shows an ester peak. Other functional groups like OH or ether might have their own peaks, but the question doesn't mention them. So perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, vinyl groups don't have oxygen, so that works. So let's imagine the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group.

Now, the vinyl group would have protons that are deshielded and appear as doublets. But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, a vinyl group typically has two protons. If it's a trans configuration, the two H would be a doublet each, but in some cases, coupling can lead to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a larger structure. For example, maybe it's attached to a CH2 group, but then we would see CH2 signals, which we don't. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is part of an aromatic ring? No, that's the main ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a CH3 group. Like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have a CH2 and a CH3. The NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which doesn't have any CH3. But then where do the two CH3 signals come in the NMR?

Wait, another approach: let's count the hydrogens and see which formula matches.

The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

We're dealing with a benzene ring (6 C, 6 H). Two substituents add to this.

Let me calculate the expected H count based on the substituents.

Each substituent adds a certain number of H.

Let's say one substituent is an ester group, O-CO-R. R could be a methyl group. So O-CO-CH3. That would add 3 H (from CH3).

The other substituent is a vinyl group, say CH2=CH2 (but that's not possible because it's ethylene, which has no H in the substituent). Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to another group with CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ether, but that would require O, which we don't have in the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that would require O again.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The two CH3 groups: each must be attached to a different environment. So perhaps the ester has a CH3 (O-CO-CH3), and another CH3 comes from a methyl group attached to something else, like a vinyl group.

Wait, but how would a vinyl group have a CH3? Unless it's a substituted vinyl, like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group. For example, CH2=CHCH2-. But that again has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group in such a way that the CH2 is not present. Wait, maybe it's a geminal group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group that's part of a larger group, like a cyclopropane. But I don't think that's indicated here.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of H in the molecule. The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic (each with 2 H?), two vinyl (each with 2 H?), and two CH3 (each with 3 H). Wait, that adds up to 2*2 (aromatic) + 2*2 (vinyl) + 2*3 (CH3) = 4 +4 +6 =14 H.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has 6 H, but in the di-substituted case, two substituents would replace two H, so the ring would have 4 H. Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals, each integrating for 2 H. So 4 H in total for aromatic.

Wait, but the total H would then be: aromatic (4) + vinyl (2, since two signals, each 2 H) + CH3 (6) = 4+2+6=12 H.

But looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option B: C12H14O2 →14 H.

Option C: C12H12O2 →12 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 →12 H.

So, the total H in the molecule would be either 12 or 14, depending on whether the substituents add more H.

Wait, but in the NMR, the signals sum to 4 aromatic, 4 vinyl, and 6 CH3, which totals 14 H. So the molecule must have 14 H. Therefore, the correct formula would be either A (C11H14O2) or B (C12H14O2).

Hmm, now I'm a bit confused because I thought the aromatic ring would have 4 H, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

If the di-substituted benzene has two substituents, each substituent replaces one H. So benzene has 6 H, but with two substituents, it's 6-2=4 H on the ring. So the aromatic signals account for 4 H.

The vinyl signals: two signals. Let's say each is integrating for 2 H. So 4 H from vinyl.

The CH3 signals: two signals, each integrating for 3 H. So 6 H.

Total H: 4+4+6=14 H.

So the molecular formula must have 14 H. So, looking at the options, A and B have 14 H (A: C11H14O2; B: C12H14O2).

Now, the formula is either C11H14O2 or C12H14O2.

What's the difference between them? The number of carbons: 11 vs 12.

The benzene is 6 C. Each substituent adds to that. Let's think: if each substituent adds a certain number of C.

Suppose substituent 1 is an ester group O-CO-R. R could be a methyl group, which is 1 C. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), which is 3 O? Wait, no: O-CO-CH3 has two O in the ester group (O from the ester oxygen and the carbonyl O). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-R, which includes two O: one from the oxygen in the ester linkage and the carbonyl O. So the substituent itself would add two O. But the molecular formula has only two O, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3, which contributes two O. Then substituent 2 can't have any O.

Substituent 2 must be a group with no O. Let's say it's a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2. But that's just a group with two C and two H. But wait, that doesn't add any H beyond the substituent.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH-CH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group (CH3). But that would be a single substituent, so the two substituents would be O-CO-CH3 and CH3. Wait, but then the benzene would have two substituents: ester and methyl. 

Wait, let's count the carbons. Benzene is 6 C. Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3. That's three carbons (the COO is part of the substituent). Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-R. R is CH3, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3: which is 3 C (the O is part of the substituent, but the carbons are COO and CH3). Wait, actually, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which includes two carbons (from COO) and one from CH3, totaling three C. So substituent 1 adds three C.

Substituent 2 is, say, a vinyl group. Let's say it's a CH2=CH2 group, but that would add two C. Wait, but then substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which is like CH2=CH-. But that's not possible without a substituent. Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group (CH3), adding one C.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 1 (methyl) = 10 C. But the options have either 11 or 12 C. So that can't be.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Let me think differently.

Perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another carbon. For example, substituent 2 could be CH2=CH-CH2- something. Wait, but then we would have CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2 group, but that would be a methylene group, which isn't present. So that's not it.

Alternative approach: let's calculate the molecular formula based on the substituents.

The benzene ring: C6H6.

Each substituent replaces a H and adds its own groups.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), which has the formula O2C-CO-CH3. Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3. So the formula for substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3, which is COOCH3. So the substituent is -O-CO-CH3.

Substituent 1 contributes: 2 O, 3 C (COOCH3 has 3 C: the O is not a C), but wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is 3 carbons (the COO is part of the group, but I'm not sure). Let me count the carbons in substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 has two carbons from the COO group (the O is from the substituent, not the carbon). Wait, no. The substituent is an ester group: R-O-CO-R'. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. So the carbons are in the COO and CH3. That's three carbons (the COO has two C, and CH3 has one). So substituent 1 adds three C, two O, and three H (from CH3).

Substituent 2 is something else. Let's say substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a CH3 group. Like CH2=CH-CH3. But that group has three C and two H from the vinyl, plus three H from the CH3. But wait, that would involve CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any CH2. Like CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which can't be attached to a benzene ring as a substituent. Or perhaps substituent 2 is a CH3 group. So substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituent 2 adds one C and three H.

So total formula:

Benzene: C6H6.

Substituent 1: COOCH3 → adds C3H3O2.

Substituent 2: CH3 → adds C1H3.

So total:

C:6 +3 +1=10.

H:6 -2 (replaced by substituents) +3 (from substituent1) +3 (from substituent2) =6-2 +3+3=10.

O: 2 (from substituent1).

Wait, but the options have more C. So this approach isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a larger group. Let's think: substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to a CH3 group without any CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 2 is a benzyl group or something, but that complicates things further.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. But that would require four O atoms (each ester has two O), which is more than the two O in the formula. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but that would require CH2=CHCH3, which has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups, each as separate signals. So each must be in a different environment.

If one is from the ester (O-CO-CH3), and the other is from a vinyl group attached to a CH3, but without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. But that would have an ether linkage, which would require another O, which isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a CH3 group in a way that doesn't have CH2. Like CH2=C(CH3)-. But that would have a CH2 group (the CH2 in CH2=C), which would be a problem because the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a geminal di-substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a group with a CH3 attached to a vinyl group, but without any CH2. How?

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just ethylene, which can't be attached as a substituent to the benzene ring without being part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group. So, the two substituents are O-CO-CH3 and CH3. Then, the structure would be 1,4-dimethylbenzoate or something similar.

Wait, but let's calculate the formula.

Benzene: C6H6.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 → adds C3H3O2.

Substituent 2: CH3 → adds C1H3.

Total C: 6 +3 +1 =10.

H: 6 -2 (substituents replace two H) +3 (COOCH3) +3 (CH3) =6-2=4 +3+3=10.

But the formula options have higher C counts. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to a CH3, but without any CH2. For example, if it's a CH2=CH- group, but then how does the CH3 come in? Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, but that has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, but that would require O, which we don't have.

Another approach: the molecular formula must have either 11 or 12 C.

If the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and a group that adds 5 C, so benzene (6) +3 (ester) +5 =14 C, which is not an option. So maybe substituent 2 is a group that adds 5 C? Like a pentyl group or something. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another ester. But that would require more O.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but that would require more O.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is an ester, and substituent 2 is a group with a CH3 and a vinyl group, but without CH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which can't be.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3. But that has CH2 groups and more O, which isn't possible.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The molecule has 14 H. The options are A) C11H14O2 and B) C12H14O2.

The benzene ring has 6 C. The substituents add the remaining C. So substituents must add 5 or 6 C.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (3 C), substituent 2 must add 5 or 6 C, which seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is a larger ester. For example, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl propionate?), but that would have more C.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH3. So substituent 1 adds 3 C (COO) +3 C (R) =6 C. Substituent 2 is something else, perhaps.

But then, the total C would be 6 (benzene) +6 (ester) + substituent 2's C.

Wait, but substituent 2 would add more C, making the total higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which adds 3 C (COO) +2 C (ethyl) =5 C.

Wait, let me recount:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → adds 3 C (COO) and 2 C (ethyl) → total 5 C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a methyl group (CH3), adding 1 C.

So total C: 6 (benzene) +5 (ester) +1 (methyl) =12 C → which matches option B (C12H14O2).

But wait, let's calculate the H.

Benzene has 6 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's an ethyl ester. The substituent replaces one H on benzene, and the ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3: 2+3=5 H).

Wait, but the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is -O-CO-CH2CH3. The ester group has two O, and the substituent contributes 3 H (from the ethyl group: the CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H, but wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which has 2 +3 =5 H. So substituent 1 adds 5 H.

Substituent 2 is CH3, which adds 3 H.

So total H: 6 (benzene) -2 (replaced) +5 (ester) +3 (methyl) =6-2=4 +5+3=12 H.

Wait, but earlier I thought the molecule must have 14 H because the NMR signals sum to 14. But according to this calculation, it's 12 H. That contradicts.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me try to see:

The NMR shows:

- 2 aromatic signals: each 2 H → 4 H.

- 2 vinyl signals: each 2 H → 4 H.

- 2 CH3 signals: each 3 H →6 H.

Total:4+4+6=14 H.

So the molecule must have 14 H. So formula must have 14 H. Looking back, the options with 14 H are A and B: C11H14O2 and C12H14O2.

So let's calculate the formula with 14 H and 6 C (benzene) plus substituents.

Let's assume substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester). Substituent 1 adds 3 C and 3 H.

Substituent 2: let's say it's a group that adds 5 C and 11 H. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group that adds a certain number of C and H.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula.

Suppose the molecule is benzene with two substituents.

Each substituent contributes:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 → adds 3 C, 3 H, 2 O.

Substituent 2: some group with x C and y H.

The total formula would be:

C:6 +3 + x = total C.

H:6 -2 (replaced) +3 (ester) + y =14 → 6-2=4 +3=7 + y=14 → y=7.

So substituent 2 must contribute 7 H.

But substituent 2 can't have 7 H because that would require a CH3CH2CH3 group or something, but that would involve CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl group. But a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a group that has CH3 and another CH3, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CHCH2CH3. But that has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH2-O-R, but that requires O, which we don't have.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to a CH3 group. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. But that has CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH3 group. So let's calculate:

Substituent 2: CH3 → adds 1 C, 3 H.

So total C:6 +3 (ester) +1 (CH3) =10 C.

Total H:6-2=4 +3 (ester) +3 (CH3) =10 H. But NMR needs 14 H. So that's not matching.

This is getting really tricky. Maybe I should think about the degree of unsaturation.

The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (22+2-14)/2=10/2=5.

B) C12H14O2 → DoU= (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (24+2-14)/2=12/2=6.

C) C12H12O2 → DoU= (24 +2-12)/2=14/2=7.

D) C11H12O2 → DoU= (22+2-12)/2=12/2=6.

The benzene ring contributes 4 DoU (1 ring + 3 double bonds in the ring?), but wait, benzene is three double bonds (so 4 DoU: one ring and three double bonds? No, each double bond is one DoU, and each ring is one DoU. Benzene has three double bonds, so three DoU from that.

Wait, DoU is calculated as each ring and each double bond as one. So benzene has three double bonds → three DoU, plus one ring → total 4 DoU.

The ester group has a double bond (carbonyl), so that's another DoU.

So total DoU from benzene and ester:4 +1=5.

If the molecule has a vinyl group (another double bond), that would add one more DoU, making total 6.

So the total DoU should be 6.

Looking at the options:

Option B: DoU 6 → matches.

Option D: DoU 6 → matches.

So the correct formula must have DoU 6. So between options B and D.

Now, the H count: the molecule must have 14 H, as per the NMR. So options with 14 H are A and B.

Wait, earlier calculation said that the NMR sums to 14 H, so the formula must have 14 H.

So, the correct formula must be either A (C11H14O2, DoU 5) or B (C12H14O2, DoU 6).

But we have a benzene ring (4 DoU), ester (1 DoU), and vinyl group (1 DoU), totaling 6 DoU. So the formula must have 6 DoU, which means option B is the only one with DoU 6 and 14 H.

So the formula is C12H14O2, option B.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, integrating for a total of 4 H. This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, where the two substituents create two distinct sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, integrating for a total of 4 H. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group with two protons in different environments.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups, integrating for a total of 6 H. These are likely from two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
4. **No signals for –CH2 groups**: This rules out any methylene groups in the structure.

### Key Analysis:
- The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning the two substituents replace two hydrogens on the benzene ring. The remaining aromatic protons account for 4 H.
- The ester group contributes to the molecular formula and accounts for the IR absorption. The other substituent is likely a vinyl group with associated methyl groups.
- The total number of hydrogens in the molecule is 14, as calculated from the NMR signals (4 aromatic H + 4 vinyl H + 6 methyl H = 14 H).
- The molecular formula must also match the degree of unsaturation (DoU). The benzene ring contributes 4 DoU (3 from the ring and 1 from the three double bonds), and the ester group contributes an additional 1 DoU. If a vinyl group is present, it adds another DoU, making the total DoU = 6.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **C11H14O2 (Option A)**:
   - DoU = 5 (calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (22 + 2 - 14)/2 = 5$).
   - This does not match the required DoU of 6, so this option is incorrect.

2. **C12H14O2 (Option B)**:
   - DoU = 6 (calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (24 + 2 - 14)/2 = 6$).
   - This matches the required DoU of 6 and has 14 H, consistent with the NMR data. This option is correct.

3. **C12H12O2 (Option C)**:
   - DoU = 7 (calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (24 + 2 - 12)/2 = 7$).
   - This does not match the required DoU of 6, so this option is incorrect.

4. **C11H12O2 (Option D)**:
   - DoU = 6 (calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (22 + 2 - 12)/2 = 6$).
   - While the DoU matches, the molecule has only 12 H, which is inconsistent with the NMR data showing 14 H. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct molecular formula is **C12H14O2**, as it satisfies both the degree of unsaturation and the total number of hydrogens indicated by the spectroscopic data.

**Answer: B**
