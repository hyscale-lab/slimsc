Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The available techniques are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let me go through each piece of data one by one and see what I can deduce.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something like that. But wait, the two other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The peak at 1650 could be due to conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester with some conjugation. Or maybe it's an amide, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't have nitrogen.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. Also, the presence of multiple peaks in the NMR probably indicates a structure with different types of protons, maybe in a ring or with substituents.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for fragments like (CH3)2O, which would be the mass of a methoxy group. Wait, or maybe it's CH2O as a fragment. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a fragment like (CH2)2O or something else. Let me think. The molecular formula options might help here. Let's look at the options again.

The possible formulas are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas vary in the number of hydrogens and oxygen. Let's think about the IR first. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is likely an O-H stretch. So the compound probably has an -OH group. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggest two different carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, but 1700 is a standard carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe the structure has both an alcohol (from the broad peak) and an ester or ketone group.

Wait, but how does that fit with the IR? If it's an ester, there's usually an O-H stretch as well, but esters don't have O-H (they have O-R groups). Hmm, but the broad peak might be from an alcohol. So maybe the compound is a diol? Or an alcohol with another carbonyl group.

Wait, but the options with O2 are A and C. Let me think about them. For example, if the compound is an ester, it would have two oxygen atoms: O from the carbonyl and O from the ester group. So the formula would be C6H12O2. Alternatively, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would also be two oxygen atoms. So the formula would have O2.

Looking at the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene in the structure. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain the conjugated carbonyl. So, the IR peak at 1650 could be the C=C stretch, but wait, no, the 1650 is a carbonyl. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The IR shows 1700 and 1650. Let me think: a carbonyl (C=O) stretch is usually around 1700-1750. If there's another peak at 1650, that might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone (conjugated C=O and C=C). Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with some substitution, but the presence of vinyl protons suggests an alkene, not necessarily an aromatic ring.

So, putting it together: an alcohol (broad peak) and an ester (maybe). But wait, esters don't have O-H groups. Unless the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Or perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0. So for A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that's one double bond. So that would imply one ring, but that leaves no DoU for the carbonyl. Hmm, wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for each molecule:

A: C6H12O2. DoU = (12 +2 -12)/2 = (2)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond.

But if the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and maybe a carbonyl (another DoU), that would require DoU of 2. But A has DoU of 1. So that can't be. Hmm, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. The formula is C6H12O2. So the calculation is:

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So only one DoU. So it's either a ring or a double bond but not both. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. Then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if it's a double bond (DoU 1), and a carbonyl (another DoU 1), that would require DoU of 2. But the formula only allows 1. So perhaps the carbonyl is part of a ring? Or maybe there's a mistake in my thinking.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. That would have a ring and a carbonyl. So, in that case, the ring contributes one DoU, and the carbonyl comes from the ester group, which is part of the ring. So perhaps that way, the DoU is 1, but there are both a ring and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, but that would require more DoU. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the other options.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. So, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) would be too much. Alternatively, a six-membered ring with a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, no, that would be two DoU: ring (1) and a double bond (1). Hmm, wait, no: a ring is one DoU, a double bond is another, so two DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a dienone or something similar.

Looking back at the IR: the 1700 and 1650 peaks. Let me think about typical functional groups. A ketone is about 1700, maybe a bit lower if conjugated. An ester is around 1740, but if conjugated, it's lower. Wait, but the peak is at 1700, which is more in line with a ketone than an ester. However, the presence of an O-H (broad peak) complicates things, as esters don't have O-H.

So perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. Let's see: if the compound has both a ketone group and an alcohol, that would mean two oxygen atoms. So the formula would have O2, which points to options A and C.

But then, the IR would show a broad peak for O-H (alcohol) and a strong peak for the ketone (1700). The 1650 could be another group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, but that would imply an aromatic ring, which would bring in more DoU.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 could be due to conjugation between the carbonyl and a double bond. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, the structure would have a C=O and a C=C conjugated. So that would explain the peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (conjugated C=C).

So, in that case, the molecule would have both a double bond and a carbonyl group. Now, considering the DoU, let's take option C: C6H10O2. Its DoU is 2, which would be the double bond and the carbonyl. That fits. So the structure could be something like a cyclohexenone derivative with an alcohol group.

Wait, but if the compound is a cyclohexenone with an alcohol, that would have a ring (DoU 1), a double bond (DoU 1?), wait, no, a ring is one DoU, and the double bond is another. That would make two. Plus the carbonyl is part of the ketone, which is also a DoU. Wait, no, because the ketone is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, in that case, the ring (1), the double bond (1), and the carbonyl (another 1), making three DoU. But the formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2. So that doesn't add up.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU: (12+2-12)/2=1. So one degree: could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (12+2-10)/2= (4)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU= (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1.

So, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond (DoU 1), and the IR suggests a carbonyl (DoU 1). So that's two DoU needed. Which options have at least two DoU? Options B and C.

So, the compound must be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

But wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at ~3000, which we thought was O-H. So the compound must have an O-H group, which implies the formula has O. So, which options have O? A, B, C, D. All except possibly others, but all options have O.

Wait, the formula options: A is O2, B is O, C is O2, D is O.

So, going back, the IR has a broad peak for O-H, so the compound must have an -OH group. So the formula must include at least one O, which all options do.

Now, the presence of O-H (alcohol) and a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). But if the compound is an ester, it's O2, but esters don't have O-H. So if the FTIR shows O-H, it's probably an alcohol and a ketone, or an acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but the 1700 peak is likely a carbonyl, which is present in acids. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, the formula would be something like C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are in an alkene. So the structure would need an alkene and a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid. Let me think: acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. Its formula is C3H4O2. But our options are for C6, so perhaps a dimer or a larger structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec fragment. The fragment at m/z 45. 45 is a common mass for a methyl ester group or perhaps a CH2CH2O type fragment. Alternatively, it's the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 45. If the fragment is a methoxy group, then the compound might have an ester group.

But if the compound is an ester, then the formula would have O2. So options A and C.

So, if the fragment is from a methoxy group, that suggests an ester. So, if the compound is an ester, then perhaps the O-H in the IR is from an alcohol, but that would conflict because esters don't have O-H. Wait, but maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, getting stuck.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a different group. Let me think of other possible fragments. For example, if the molecular ion breaks into a smaller part, like a fragment with a ketone, maybe.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of the ester group's fragment. Let me think: the mass of (CH3COO-) is 60 (C=12, H=1, O=16. CH3COO: (12*3)+(1*5)+(16*2)=36+5+32=73? No, wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, CH3COO- is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2) = 24 +3 +32 = 59. Hmm, not 45.

Another possibility: The fragment m/z 45 could be (CH2CH2O) as a group. Wait, CH2CH2O doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's 30.

Wait, perhaps it's a fragment of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is (something) that breaks into a CH2CH2O group. Wait, maybe a methyl group attached to something. Another thought: 45 could be the mass of CH2CH2O, which is 45? Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So CH2CH2O would be 2*12 (C2) +5*1 (H5?) Wait, no. Wait, CH2CH2O would be C2H5O? Wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe it's (CH2)2O, which would be 2*(12+2) +16 = 2*14 +16= 44. Close to 45. Not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3CH2O, which is 45? Let's calculate: C2H5O. (2*12)+(5*1)+(16)=24+5+16=45. Yes! So, the fragment at m/z 45 could be the ethoxy group (CH2CH3O-), which has a mass of 45. So that suggests the presence of an ethoxy group in the compound.

If the compound has an ethoxy group, it's likely an ester. Because esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, if the ester is an ethoxy group, that would fit.

So, putting it together: the compound is likely an ester with an ethoxy group. So, the formula would have O2. So, options A and C.

But wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. Esters don't have O-H, so that's confusing. So maybe the compound isn't an ester. Maybe it's an alcohol with another O-containing group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else where O-H is present.

Wait, another thought: The two IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups, or one carbonyl and another functional group. But 1700 is a strong peak for a carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like stretching for C=C in an aromatic ring). But the NMR has vinyl H, which are typically non-aromatic. So probably a conjugated carbonyl.

So, if the compound has an alcohol group (from the broad peak), a conjugated carbonyl (from 1700 and 1650), and a double bond (from NMR), what would that imply?

The formula must have O2 if it's an alcohol and a carbonyl group. Because each O is in an -OH and a ketone or ester.

Wait, no. An alcohol has one O, a ketone has one O, so total O is 2. So the formula would be O2, like options A and C.

So, considering that, and the mass spec fragment of 45, which suggests an ethoxy group, perhaps the compound is an ethyl ester of some sort. But since the IR shows O-H, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 fragment isn't from the ester but from another part of the molecule. Let me think: for example, if the compound is something like methyl propionate, its molecular formula is C3H6O2. But our options are for C6.

Wait, but the options are for C6 compounds. So the compound is likely a cyclic ester (lactone) or a larger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic compound with an ester group, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, perhaps it's a diester. But that's getting complicated.

Let me go back to the options.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So, either two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

If the structure has a ring and a double bond, that explains the IR and NMR data. Let me imagine a structure like cyclohexene with a ketone group. So, cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone would have a formula of C6H10O. Wait, cyclohexenone is (cyclohexene with a ketone). So the formula would be C6H10O. Does that fit any of the options?

Wait, option B is C6H10O. So that's one possibility. But then, the IR would show a strong peak at 1700 (ketone), but where is the O-H? Because the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which would be O-H. So if the compound is an alcohol with a ketone, that would require O2. So the formula would have to be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C).

Wait, but cyclohexenone is C6H10O, which is option B. But in that case, where is the O-H? Unless cyclohexenone has a hydroxyl group somewhere else. Like, maybe it's cyclohexenol with a ketone? But that might not be possible due to ring strain or stability.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. Let's say, something like cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. That would necessitate O2. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So, if the structure is an alpha-hydroxy ketone, that would explain the O-H (broad peak), the ketone peak at 1700, and perhaps the conjugated double bond (maybe in the same ring, leading to a peak at 1650). The vinyl hydrogens would be from the double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass spec: fragment at 45. If the compound is a diol or has an ethoxy group, that would explain the 45. Let me think: if the compound is an ethyl ester, the fragment could be the ethoxy group (CH2CH3O, m/z 45). So the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A). But earlier, I thought that the DoU for A is 1, but the structure would need a double bond and a carbonyl, which are two DoU.

Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. Let me calculate its degrees of unsaturation again.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So only one DoU. So either a ring or a double bond. But the presence of a double bond and a carbonyl would require two DoU, so that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring. For example, a cyclic ketone. So, a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond. Wait, but that would require two DoU (ring and double bond). So, the DoU is 1, which is not enough. So that can't be.

So, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with substituents. Benzene has three DoU (three double bonds). But the formula for benzene is C6H6. Our options are C6H10O2, which is more saturated. So, with DoU 2.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible functional groups.

If the compound has an O-H (alcohol), a carbonyl (like a ketone), and a double bond (from vinyl H), then the formula must have O2 and have at least two DoU.

So, C6H10O2 (option C) has two DoU, which could be a ring plus double bond, or two double bonds, etc. So, a structure that has a ring (like cyclohexane) and a double bond, plus a ketone group.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a di-substituted cyclohexene with a ketone group. But that would require O2? No, the ketone is O, so the formula would be C6H10O. So that's option B. But then, where's the O-H?

Ah, but if the substituents are a hydroxyl group and a ketone, then the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). So that makes sense.

So, the structure would have a six-membered ring (cyclohexane), a double bond (making it cyclohexene), a ketone group (O), and a hydroxyl group (O). That adds up to two oxygen atoms.

In that case, the IR would show a broad O-H peak, a strong ketone peak at 1700, and maybe a conjugated double bond, which might explain the 1650 peak.

The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (from the double bond in the ring), and perhaps other protons depending on the substituents.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule breaking off, perhaps a small ester group or something else. But I'm not entirely sure, but given the other data, this seems plausible.

So, looking at the options:

- Option C is C6H10O2. That fits with two oxygen atoms (from OH and ketone), two degrees of unsaturation (ring and double bond), and the spectroscopic data.

So, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol). Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly indicating a conjugated system. The 1H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with a small ester or ether group, such as CH₂CH₃O.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): 1  
   - This formula allows for either a ring or a double bond but not both. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond) and a carbonyl group (another double bond) requires at least two DoU. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): 2  
   - This formula allows for one ring and one double bond. However, it only accounts for one oxygen atom, which contradicts the broad O-H peak in the FTIR spectrum. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): 2  
   - This formula allows for one ring and one double bond, which matches the presence of vinyl hydrogens and a carbonyl group. The two oxygen atoms account for the O-H group (alcohol) and the carbonyl group, consistent with the FTIR data. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 could correspond to a small ester or ether group, supporting this option.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): 1  
   - Similar to Option A, this formula allows for only one DoU, which is insufficient to account for the double bond and carbonyl group. Additionally, it only accounts for one oxygen atom, contradicting the FTIR data. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms (from an alcohol and a carbonyl group), two degrees of unsaturation (for a ring and a double bond), and a fragment peak at m/z = 45 consistent with a small ester or ether group. These criteria are best satisfied by **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**.
