Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, let me think. The question says we have two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, right, the concept here relates to the uncertainty principle. I remember that the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and τ is the lifetime. Oh wait, but wait, ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s, right?

But wait, how does this relate to distinguishing energy levels? Oh, right, if the energy difference between the two states is larger than the uncertainty, then they can be distinguished. Because if the uncertainty is smaller than the energy difference, you can tell them apart.

So the lifetime for each state determines the uncertainty in their energy measurements. If the two states have different lifetimes, their uncertainties are different. So the worst case is the larger uncertainty, perhaps. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each state has its own uncertainty. The uncertainty for E1 is ħ/τ1, and for E2 it's ħ/τ2. So which one is larger? Since τ1 is 1e-9 s and τ2 is 1e-8 s, which is 10 times longer. So τ2 is larger, so ħ/τ2 is smaller than ħ/τ1. So the uncertainty for E2 is smaller. So the maximum uncertainty we have to consider is the larger one, which is from the shorter lifetime. Because if the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, both can be resolved.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let's say the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is bigger than the uncertainty of either state, then they can be distinguished.

Wait, that sounds a bit off. Maybe the approach is to calculate the uncertainty for each and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps just larger than the maximum uncertainty? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in the measurement. But the measurement is about the energy levels, so maybe the relevant uncertainty is the average or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, the question is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference should be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. Uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 =1e-8 s. So ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.05e-25 J. To convert this to eV, since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 /1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV. Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, that's quite a large energy. But the options given are in the range of 1e-11 to 1e-4 eV. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate. So τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ħ/τ1 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J. Right, but 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so:

1.05e-25 J = (1.05e-25) / (1.6e-19) eV. Let me compute that. 1.05e-25 /1.6e-19 = 1.05/(1.6) * 1e-6 → 0.65625e-6 → 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ħ/τ2 is 1.05e-34 /1e-8 =1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈6.56e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are about 6.56e-7 eV and 6.56e-8 eV for the two states.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, or perhaps just larger than the larger one. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of each, then you can resolve them.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. But wait, that would be 6.56e-7 +6.56e-8 = ~7.2e-7 eV. But the options are much lower than that. So that can't be right.

Wait another approach: the energy resolution is determined by the time resolution. For a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty of the energy measurements.

In other words, ΔE > ħ/τ, where τ is the uncertainty in time. But perhaps in this case, the relevant time is the longer lifetime. Because the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty, so the easier it is to have a small ΔE. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy resolution is limited by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So a longer lifetime gives a smaller uncertainty, making it easier to distinguish small differences.

Wait, but in this problem, the states have different lifetimes. So for E1 with τ1, the uncertainty is ΔE1= ħ/τ1. For E2, ΔE2= ħ/τ2. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference E2-E1 must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but that would require ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Since ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2 (because τ1 is shorter than τ2), so the condition is that ΔE > ΔE1.

So the minimum ΔE should be just a bit larger than ΔE1, which is 6.56e-7 eV. But looking at the options, the only one above that is option C) 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. But 1e-4 is much larger than 6.56e-7. So that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but wait. The options are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

But according to the calculation, the minimum required ΔE is 6.56e-7 eV, which is about 6.6e-7 eV. None of the options match that exactly, but the closest higher option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the units.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, for τ1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert J to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-6 eV.

Calculating 1.0545718 / 1.602176634 ≈ 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV =6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J → 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-7 eV → 0.658e-7 eV=6.58e-8 eV.

So our earlier calculation was correct. The uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV, respectively.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then you can distinguish the two. Because if ΔE > ΔE1, then you can tell that E2 and E1 are different.

Wait, but wait, the formula I've read before is that the energy resolution is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the measurement time. So, for two states, I think the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. However, in this case, each state has its own uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in the transition between the two states. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but given that the lifetimes are different, perhaps the minimum detectable energy difference is determined by the larger uncertainty (shorter lifetime, larger uncertainty). So ΔE must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the only one that's larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 eV.

So option C would be the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the uncertainty principle, which states that the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. For two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

To convert these uncertainties into electron volts (eV), we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the larger uncertainty, \( \Delta E_1 \), to ensure the two states can be clearly distinguished. Thus, \( \Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Among the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as it is greater than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is less than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**, \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
