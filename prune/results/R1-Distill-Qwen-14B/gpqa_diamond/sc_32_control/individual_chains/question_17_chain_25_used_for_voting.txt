Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (Kf) is given. So, Kf is a measure of the stability of the complex, right? The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Stochiometric probably means it's the CaY²− complex, where Y is the EDTA^4−. So the formula would be CaY²−, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

I think the formation constant expression is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, the Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But in this case, we have the complex concentration, and we need to find [Ca²+]. So, the question is, if we have 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−, and the Kf is 5e10, what's the [Ca²+]?

Wait, but wait. EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. The problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess the pH is such that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4− form. That's important because EDTA's speciation depends on pH. At a certain pH (like the pKa conditions), the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4− form is high, so the formation constant is accurate as given.

So given the ideal pH, we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4− is approximately equal to the concentration of free EDTA, which I'll call [Y^4−].

But wait, in the solution, the total EDTA is coming from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Because the CaEDTA²− can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the initial concentration is all in the form of CaEDTA²−, which has a concentration of 0.02 M.

So, let's denote:

Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, because for every mole of Ca²+ released, one mole of EDTA^4− is released. The complex's concentration would then be (0.02 - x). But wait, if the Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation would be minimal. So x would be very small compared to 0.02.

So, approximately, [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] ≈ x, [Y^4−] ≈ x.

So plugging into the Kf equation: Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 0.02 / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²).

So, Kf = 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13. Then x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. Hmm, no, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5) squared?

Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

x² = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * approx 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, wait, actually, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 6.5 times 2 is 13. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times 3.16e-7 is approx 6.32e-7.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this. But wait, let me think again whether I made any mistakes.

Wait, why did I approximate [CaY²−] as 0.02 M? Because the dissociation is so small (since Kf is very large), the amount of complex that dissociates is negligible. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should be a valid assumption.

So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \), the concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \), and the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) are equal (\( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x \)).

Substituting these values into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root to find \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
