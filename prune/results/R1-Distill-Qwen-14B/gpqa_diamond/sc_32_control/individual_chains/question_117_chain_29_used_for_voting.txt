Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm. I remember that optical isomerism, or optical activity, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this property.

The question lists four moieties, and the options are combinations of them. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2', each as methyl esters. Wait, so the structure has two benzene rings connected. Now, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a plane of symmetry or lack it. If the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then maybe it can have stereoisomerism.

Wait, but biphenyls can have different configurations. So the substituents on each ring: 6 and 6' are nitro, and 2 and 2' are the ester groups. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at position 1 (each ring's position 1). So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. Are the groups on each ring such that the molecule has a center of chirality or a plane of symmetry?

Hmm, the two ester groups are on the same side? Or opposite? Wait, the way it's written, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. So if the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But if they are arranged asymmetrically, perhaps there's a possibility of optical isomerism.

Wait, but biphenyls can have what's called a "twist" in their structure, leading to different diastereomers. But for optical isomerism, I think the molecule needs to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the compound could be chiral. Let me think about the positions. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So if both rings are identical, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but the way the substituents are arranged: on each ring, the nitro is in the para position relative to the connecting point. Wait, no. Wait, in biphenyl, the two rings are connected at the 1 position. So the substituents on each ring's 6 position are both nitro. So each ring's 6 is nitro, and 2 is ester.

Wait, but if the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents are on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans), does that make a difference in symmetry? If the substituents are on the same face, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical because each ring has the same substituents. So each ring has a nitro and an ester group. So perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, which would prevent it from being chiral. So maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each ring's substituents are in a certain configuration that leads to chirality. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the next compounds and come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's think about its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-CO2H, and the ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO2Me. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-COOH with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is: 

CH3
|
O
|
C-O-Me
|
CH(OH)

Wait, no, the correct structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH(OH)CH2... wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me draw it.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- two CH2 groups (one from the adjacent carbon and the other from the ester group?), wait no. Let me think again. The structure is: 

CH3-CH2-COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the middle CH2. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH3-CH(OH)-

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- a hydroxyl (OH),
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me correct: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH) part.

So the four groups attached to that carbon are:

- CH3 (the adjacent carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2? No, wait. Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (on one side),
- OH (on another),
- COOCH3 (on another),
- and the fourth group is a single bond to the adjacent carbon, which is the next CH in the chain. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon, which is attached to:

- CH3 (the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (on the third carbon),
- and another CH2 group? No, wait. No, the third carbon is the COOCH3. So wait, the central carbon (number 2) is attached to:

1. CH3 (carbon 1),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (carbon 3),
4. and another group? Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 and 3, but each carbon can have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH) connected to Carbon 1 and 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So Carbon 2: CH(OH) with four substituents:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and another CH? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is CH2(OH), connected to two CH2 groups (C1 and C3). Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, if that's the case, then the central carbon (C2) has:

- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- an OH,
- and a COOCH3 group on the same carbon? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Ah, that makes sense. So it's propionic acid where the middle carbon (C2) has a hydroxyl group, and the end is the ester.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the C2 has four substituents:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a single bond to the neighboring carbon (C3, which is the COOCH3).

Wait, no, the C2 is connected to:

- C1 (CH3),
- C3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- and another CH? No, wait, perhaps the C2 is the middle carbon, so the substituents are:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and a single bond to the next carbon, which is the same as C3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as having a central carbon attached to four different groups. Let me see: for the hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (C3),
- and the fourth group would be a CH2? No, wait, the structure is:

C1: CH3

C2: CH(OH)

C3: COOCH3

So the C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (COOCH3), and has an OH. But wait, that's only three substituents. Oh, wait, no. The carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the C2 (middle carbon) is connected to:

- C1 (CH3),
- OH,
- C3 (COOCH3),
- and another H? No, because each carbon must have four bonds.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the C2 has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another H? No, wait, that would give it four bonds. So the C2 has:

- CH3 (C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (C3),
- and one more H attached.

Wait, no, wait. No, the CH(OH) would imply that the C2 has three substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the next carbon?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual substituents on the C2. If C2 is -CH(OH)-, then it's connected to:

- C1 (CH3),
- C3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, that would make four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So all four substituents are different? No, because H is the same as H. So if the C2 has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H, then the H is the same as itself but different from the others. Wait, but in that case, the four groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So all four are different. So that would make the C2 a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Yes, that makes sense. So this compound would exhibit optical isomerism because the central carbon has four different substituents.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, so it's two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So each phenyl group is attached to a carbonyl carbon. Now, does benzophenone have any chiral centers? The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it doesn't have four substituents. So the molecule is symmetric, right? The two phenyl groups are identical, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, it cannot be chiral. So benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), and fumaric acid is the trans version (the COOH groups on opposite sides).

Wait, no. Let me recall: maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H with the double bond in the cis configuration (the two COOH groups are on the same side), and fumaric acid is the trans isomer, same structure but opposite configuration.

So the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid would be MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When you esterify both COOH groups with methyl groups, you get MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Now, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. Each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to two methyl ester groups and a double bond. Wait, each of the double bond carbons has two substituents: COOCH3 and another COOCH3? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, that's not fumarate. Fumarate is actually a trans-diepoxy? No, wait. No, wait, fumarate is:

Phthalic acid is HOOC-C6H4-COOH (but in the cis and trans configurations). Wait, no, phthalic acid has benzene rings, while fumaric acid is a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H? No, that's not right. Wait, no, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration.

So the structure is:

      O
      ||
HOOC-C=C-COOH

But the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the two COOH groups are on opposite sides (trans).

So the dimethyl ester would be:

      O
      ||
MeOOC-C=C-COOCH3

But wait, actually, each COOH is esterified with methyl, so it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration (fumarate).

So the molecule has two ester groups on each end of a double bond. Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism? Well, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, but in the case of fumarate, the substituents on each side are the same: each side has a methyl ester and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no: each end of the double bond has COOCH3 groups, but the question is about the possibility of stereoisomerism.

Wait, but fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either side. The double bond is between the two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups and the two methyl groups? No, each carbonyl is connected to a methyl group via the ester, so each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, so the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. No, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, right? Because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the ester is the same but with methyl groups.

In this molecule, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups attached. So each has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups? Or one COOCH3 and another group?

Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 and another CH group. Wait, no, let me clarify:

In fumarate, the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid. The ester would be dimethyl (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, but I think I'm mixing this up. Let me think again: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups?

No, each of the middle carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the molecule. Each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? No, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C1)
|
CH2-CH2 (but wait, no, it's CH=CH)
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C4)

No, that's not right. Wait, for butenedioate, the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be the cis version (if the two ester groups are on the same side), but fumarate is the trans version.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be, because that would be a single bond.

Wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, not correct. Wait, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is on C1, then C2 is double bonded to C3, and C4 is O-C-OCH3.

So it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - C = C - O-C-OCH3
|
|

Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 and O=C-OCH3 on either end of the double bond. So each end of the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group, which is connected to an OCH3.

So the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, in that case, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) have substituents: C2 has a COOCH3 group, a double bond to C3, and two CH groups each connected to a methyl ester? No, perhaps each of C2 and C3 is connected to one COOCH3, one CH2 (or CH?), and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the possibility of stereoisomerism. For a molecule to have stereoisomerism, especially optical isomers, it must have a chiral center or a double bond with substituents arranged in a way that allows for E/Z isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents. Let's see, each of the double bond carbons has two substituents: one COOCH3 and another CH2 group? Or perhaps each has a COOCH3 and a CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not a double bond. So perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate is:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group.

In that case, each of the CH groups (C2 and C3) have two different substituents: COOCH3 and another CH.

But wait, each of these carbons is part of a double bond, so they can't have four substituents. Oh, wait, the carbons in a double bond have only three substituents each. So for stereoisomerism, the double bond must have at least two different substituents on each carbon.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups and a methyl group? No, wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH group. So each has two substituents besides the double bond. So, for example, C2 has COOCH3 and two Hs and a double bond. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the geometry. Fumarate is the trans-diesters of fumaric acid. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a trans configuration across the double bond.

But how does that relate to optical isomerism? Well, optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center. A double bond can lead to geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but not optical isomerism unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry when considering the double bond. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate would have E and Z isomers, but do they exhibit optical activity?

Wait, no. Optical isomerism is about the molecule being non-superimposable mirror images. For a molecule with a double bond, unless there's a chiral center, it won't exhibit optical isomerism. So in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetric. Because the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same (each has a COOCH3 and a CH group), maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, and hence not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (which is the E isomer) might not be chiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetric, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it needs to have a chiral center or a chiral axis. A double bond isn't a chiral center, but the molecule as a whole can be chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's consider the structure: each side of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 (or CH) group. Wait, maybe each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, making the substituents on each side the same. So the molecule would be symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think about it: if the substituents on each end of the double bond are identical, then the molecule is symmetrical. If they're not identical, then the molecule could be chiral. So in fumarate, each substituent is COOCH3 and a CH group. Are both substituents on each end the same? Let me imagine the structure:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, it's a double bond. So it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each of the CH groups in the double bond have a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and another group. For example, C2 is connected to COOCH3 and another group (like CH2), and C3 is connected to COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond has two different substituents. So, for C2: substituents are COOCH3 and CH2 (from the CH2 group). For C3: substituents are COOCH3 and CH2 as well. So each carbon has the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps each end of the double bond has a different arrangement. So if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it might be chiral. But in the case of fumarate, the substituents are arranged trans, making the molecule symmetrical. Or is it?

Wait, in fumarate, the substituents (the COOCH3 groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: if a molecule has a double bond with two identical substituents on each end, it's symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So perhaps each substituent is the same on both ends, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake. Let's think about the actual structure again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's butanedioate. No, wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl 2,3-dicarboxybut-2-enedioate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C1)
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on C4)

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's not a double bond. Oh, I'm getting stuck on the structure again. Let me try to think differently.

Let me look for whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. If it doesn't, then no optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In the molecule, each carbon in the ester groups (the ones attached to OCH3) is connected to:

- OCH3,
- O,
- and two other carbons (maybe).

Wait, the carbons in the ester group are the ones attached to the oxygen. So for each COOCH3 group, the carbon is attached to:

- OCH3,
- two oxygen atoms (one double bond, one single),
- and the adjacent carbon.

So the carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to O and can't be chiral centers because they have only three substituents. The other carbons in the chain would be the ones in the middle.

Wait, if the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, then the central carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to:

- COOCH3,
- another group (like CH),
- and two substituents from the double bond.

But since they're part of a double bond, they can't have four substituents. So they're not chiral centers.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, there are no chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, each side of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond axis. Hence, it's achiral, and no optical isomerism.

So, from the four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure yet. Let me think again. The structure has two biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't be chiral. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are on the same side of each ring, the molecule might be symmetrical. Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule might lack symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are mirrored, then it's symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, if the two nitro groups are on the same face of each ring, and the same with the ester groups, then the molecule could be symmetrical. So perhaps it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents are symmetrical. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but sometimes biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for instance, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, and the ester groups are on the same side, then the molecule would be symmetrical.

Alternatively, if the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides of each ring, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the first compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, reviewing the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Probably no optical isomerism because symmetrical.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3. Benzophenone: No, because it's symmetrical.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but I thought earlier that dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So among the options, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 3 compounds.

B) 3 and 4 → 2.

C) 2 and 3 → 2.

D) 1 and 2 → 2.

Wait, but I'm getting that only 2 is correct. So that would mean the answer is only option 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 3

B) 3,4 → 2

C) 2 and 3 → 2

D) 1 and 2 → 2

Wait, so I might have made a mistake. Because if 2 is correct, then which options include 2.

Option A includes 1,2,4. If 1 isn't correct, and 4 isn't correct, then option A is wrong.

Option D includes 1 and 2. If only 2 is correct, then D is wrong because 1 isn't.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the first compound does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2.

So, if each ring has the nitro and ester groups in a way that makes the molecule not symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the two rings are mirror images, the molecule would be symmetrical. But if they are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule would lack symmetry and thus be chiral.

But given that the substituents are on the same positions (2 and 6) on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if on each ring the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to a lack of symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 does.

But looking back at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Could it have a chiral center? No, because the carbons in the double bond are each attached to three substituents (double bond and two groups). So no chiral centers.

But wait, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Well, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then yes. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 and a CH group. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to the same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

So, back to the four compounds:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. Oh wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → three.

Option D: 1,2 → two.

So perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I missed that one of the other compounds also has optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Maybe the molecule is chiral due to the configuration around the double bond?

No, because double bonds themselves don't create chirality. Only chiral centers do.

So, perhaps only compound 2 does.

But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and3

D)1 and 2

Wait, if only 2 is correct, then none of the options fit. But that can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Let me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester at position 2. The two rings are connected in a 1,1' fashion.

So, the structure is such that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether the arrangement of these substituents leads to a lack of symmetry.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But if they're arranged symmetrically, then it's not.

Assuming that the substituents on each ring are in a para arrangement, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. But if they're not, perhaps it's not.

Wait, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. For a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (where the biphenyl connects), and position 6 is opposite to position 1.

So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 (adjacent to the connecting position) and 6 (opposite to the connecting position).

If the substituents are arranged so that each ring has a nitro and an ester, but their positions relative to each other are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the connecting axis, making it symmetrical.

If the substituents on each ring are mirrored across the connecting axis, then the molecule is symmetrical. But if they're not, then it's not.

For example, if on each ring, the nitro group is on the same side relative to the connecting axis, and the ester is on the same side, then the molecule is symmetrical. But if they're on opposite sides, it's not.

I think that without knowing the exact substituent arrangement, it's hard to say. But sometimes, such biphenyl derivatives can be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that mirror images are possible, leading to enantiomers.

Wait, but given that the substituents are in the same positions (2 and 6) on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options again, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). But if I'm correct, only 2 is correct. But the options don't include that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Does it have any stereocenters? No, if each substituent is the same on both ends.

Wait, but maybe the molecule is chiral in another way. Wait, could the double bond lead to axial chirality? That's a possibility. Axial chirality occurs when a molecule has a helix-like structure, such as in allenes or certain cyclopropane derivatives. But in the case of a simple trans double bond, I don't think there's axial chirality.

So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is achiral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the answer options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

If only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

No, because the double bond carbons are attached to only three substituents each. So no, they can't be chiral centers.

So, perhaps my initial analysis was correct. Only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But then, looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 3.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)₂CO. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygens (double bonds). So, the central carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two Ph groups. Wait, no. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and an O with a double bond.

No chiral center here. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: which of these compounds have chiral centers?

Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Any chiral centers here?

Well, the biphenyl rings themselves wouldn't have chiral centers unless the substituents create one. Each ring has two substituents: nitro and ester. So, perhaps the central carbons (those attached to the rings) could be chiral if their substituents are different.

Wait, no. The carbons connecting the two rings are part of the benzene rings and are sp² hybridized. So they can't be chiral centers.

So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes, as discussed earlier.

3. benzophenone: no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: no.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong about one of the other compounds.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each CH group is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH, and the double bond. So each has three substituents: COOCH3, CH, and the double bond. So no chiral centers.

But what about the arrangement of substituents leading to a lack of plane of symmetry?

If the substituents on each end of the double bond are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Wait, in the case of fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides (trans). So the molecule's structure is such that it's not symmetrical because each substituent is on opposite sides. But wait, each substituent is a COOCH3 and a CH group. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on this. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer includes compounds 1 and 2, as in option D.

But why would compound 1 have optical isomerism?

Well, perhaps the biphenyl rings are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

If the substituents on each ring are in a way that the two rings are mirror images, but the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, the molecule could be chiral.

So, perhaps the first compound does exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely certain, but given the available options, perhaps the correct answer includes 1 and 2, which would be option D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for examples online.

Wait, I remember that biphenyl derivatives with substituents in specific positions can exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are not symmetrical, the molecule can be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. If the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to the connecting axis are not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral.

So, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then the correct answer would include compounds 1 and 2, which is option D.

So, the answer would be D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or a lack of symmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. The molecule may lack a plane of symmetry if the substituents (nitro and ester groups) are arranged asymmetrically on the rings. This lack of symmetry could make the molecule chiral, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, this compound likely exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not have four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, as the two phenyl groups are identical. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with a trans configuration across the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each side of the double bond are identical (COOCH₃ and CH groups). Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 likely exhibits optical isomerism due to the lack of symmetry in the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl rings.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism because they are symmetrical and lack chiral centers.

### Final Answer:
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.  
Answer: D
