Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, like a mass on a spring, F equals negative kx. But this problem is relativistic, so I guess I can't ignore relativistic effects. 

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about both harmonic oscillators and relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², right? And when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, the problem is relativistic, so option C might be the non-relativistic case, which is probably not the correct answer here.

So, since it's relativistic, I need to consider relativistic mechanics. In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy which includes rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Also, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, the kinetic energy is (gamma m c²) - m c². So the total energy would be gamma m c², which equals the potential energy plus the kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + m c² (since at x=0, the KE is the highest, but wait, no, wait. Wait, when x is maximum, the potential is maximum, and the kinetic is zero. So at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic. So when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + m c².

Wait, that can't be right because for a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx². But when x is zero, the potential is zero, and the kinetic is maximum. So when x is maximum, potential is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)kA², but wait, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy, so E_total = (gamma) m c². Wait, but in the rest frame, the mass's rest energy is m c². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the KE is zero, so the total energy is just the rest energy plus the potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², so the total energy is gamma m c², which includes the rest mass energy.

So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is equal to the rest energy plus the potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². But wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy contribute to the total energy the same way? I think so because potential energy is part of the energy, whether classical or relativistic.

So when the oscillator is at x=0, moving at maximum speed v_max, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy plus the rest energy. So E = (gamma) m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, at x=0, the potential is zero, so E = gamma m c² = m c² + kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². But earlier, when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A² + m c² (since the kinetic is zero, so E is just rest energy plus potential). 

So, when x=A, E is (1/2)k A² + m c². When x=0, E is gamma m c². Since energy is conserved, these must be equal. So setting them equal:

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c²

Subtracting m c² from both sides:

gamma m c² - m c² = (1/2)k A²
m c² (gamma -1 ) = (1/2)k A²

So gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, because gamma -1 equals (k A²)/(2 m c²). So:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm, I need to solve for v, which is v_max.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as some term, let's say, alpha. So alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + alpha)

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Rearranging,

v²/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

Let me compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2:

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [1/(1 + alpha)]^2

So, v²= c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2:

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2

So,

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

Factor alpha in numerator:

= c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 

Which can be written as:

= c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute back:

alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

v_max² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Which is (k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor the denominator and numerator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression.

Wait, let's make this substitution: Let me set beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So, alpha = beta.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's helping. Let me see; perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: let's write the expression as:

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2

Which is,

= c^2 * alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

Let me compute the numerator:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 ) / (2 m c²) ) ] 

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too messy, but maybe I can factor terms to simplify.

Wait, another approach: since the denominator is (1 + alpha)^2, and the numerator is alpha (2 + alpha), perhaps I can write:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Let me factor the numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (1 + 1 + alpha) = alpha (1 + (1 + alpha)) 

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 2 + alpha as (1 + alpha) +1.

Hmm. Alternatively, let me expand the denominator:

(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha²

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / [1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2]

Hmm. Let me factor the numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha)

Wait, perhaps it's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (1 + alpha) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me see:

Numerator: 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (alpha + 2) = alpha ( (alpha +1) +1 )

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not so obvious. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (alpha +2) alpha = (alpha +2) alpha.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can let beta = alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

v_max^2 = c² [ beta (beta +2) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt[ beta (beta + 2) / (1 + beta)^2 ]

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( beta (beta + 2) ) / (1 + beta )

Simplify sqrt (beta (beta + 2)).

Wait, beta (beta +2) = beta^2 + 2 beta = (beta +1)^2 -1.

So sqrt( beta (beta+2) ) = sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the terms:

sqrt( beta (beta +2) ) = sqrt( beta^2 + 2 beta )

Which can be written as sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 )

Wait, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as sqrt( (beta + 1)^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( (beta +1 -1)(beta +1 +1) ) ) = sqrt( beta (beta +2) ), which brings me back. Hmm, maybe that's a dead end.

Another approach: let's express the expression under the square root:

beta (beta +2) / (1 + beta)^2 = [ beta (beta +2) ] / (beta +1)^2.

Wait, let me expand the numerator:

beta (beta +2) = beta^2 + 2 beta.

Denominator is (beta +1)^2 = beta^2 + 2 beta +1.

So,

[ beta^2 + 2 beta ] / [ beta^2 + 2 beta +1 ].

Hmm, I can write this as:

[ (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 ) -1 ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 )

Which is,

1 - [1/(beta^2 + 2 beta +1)].

But beta^2 + 2 beta +1 is (beta +1)^2.

So,

[ beta (beta +2) ] / (beta +1)^2 = 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 ]

Thus,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 )

But beta is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

beta +1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(beta +1) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ] 

Which can be written as:

1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Wait, so,

1/(beta +1)^2 = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which matches our expression. So that would be option D.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes, that matches.

Alternatively, let me check other options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 ), no, doesn't look right.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ), but the structure doesn't match.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we know isn't correct.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). This total energy is conserved and equals the total relativistic energy at \( x = 0 \), where the velocity is maximum.

1. **Total Energy at Maximum Displacement**:  
   At \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

2. **Total Energy at \( x = 0 \)**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is the relativistic total energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \).

3. **Equating Energies**:  
   Setting the two expressions for \( E \) equal gives:  
   \[
   \gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Subtracting \( m c^2 \) from both sides:  
   \[
   \gamma m c^2 - m c^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   \[
   m c^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma - 1 \):  
   \[
   \gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}}
   \]  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2 \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2} \right]
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:  
   \[
   \text{D) } v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]
