Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with cyanide ion, what usually happens? Oh, right! The cyanide ion can act as a nucleophile. In the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

So, the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The ketone has a carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. The CN- would attack it, adding to the carbonyl. But wait, then what happens after that? Oh, the oxygen would have a negative charge, so it would pick up a proton. Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group. So maybe the mechanism is that the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol after protonation and elimination of a leaving group. Wait, but in ketone cyanohydrin formation, the product is a secondary alcohol with the OH and CN attached to the same carbon. Oh, right, that's what's happening here.

So, the starting material is (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. How is that typically done? I think it's done under acidic conditions. Oh yes, because the acid helps to generate the cyanide ion from NaCN. Wait, no, NaCN is a strong base, but in the presence of an acid, maybe H3O+ is needed as a reagent to help with protonation steps.

So reagent A is probably H3O+. Because when you add NaCN to a ketone, you usually add an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or H3O+ to facilitate the reaction. So looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ for A. Options C and D have NaHSO3, which I'm not so sure about.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding acid. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The usual way is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat, or with strong base. Alternatively, maybe using H2O and some oxidizing agent, but I think more likely it's a hydrolysis reaction.

So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, what happens? The nitrile (RCN) can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). For that, you typically use strong oxidizing conditions. So for example, using HClO (chlorine water) or other strong oxidizing agents in acidic conditions. Or, in some cases, using H2O with H+ or other catalysts.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis. But wait, nitriles hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, H2O and H+ can protonate the nitrile, leading to its hydrolysis. Or, under basic conditions, like H2O with a base like KOH, which leads to the formation of a sodium salt, which can be acidified later.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis must have gone to completion, probably under strong acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile is being oxidized. But oxidation of nitriles usually requires strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O, but it's combined with something else as the reagent. Wait, no, the question says that in the second reaction, B is H2O. So perhaps the reagent is aqueous with some acid or base.

Wait, looking back at the question: the second reaction is with B (H2O). Hmm, maybe that's a typo or perhaps the reagent is H2O in the presence of another reagent. Oh wait, looking at the question again: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So I think B is the reagent, and it's H2O. But that doesn't make sense because just water alone might not be enough for the hydrolysis. So perhaps the reaction is done under specific conditions, such as acid or base catalysis.

Wait, but the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH, or perhaps other things. The options for B in the choices are A: H3O+, B: HCl; C: NaHSO3, B: HCl; D: NaHSO3, B: CH3COOH. Wait, no, the options are for A and B: each option gives A and B. So the options are structured as A and B in the pairs.

So in the second reaction, the reagent is B. Looking at the options: for option A, B is HCl. Option B has B as CH3COOH. Option C, B is HCl. Option D, B is CH3COOH. So the options give what B is.

So, in the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So we need to determine the reagent B.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid: typically, you need strong acid and heat, or strong base and heat, followed by acid workup. For example, in acidic conditions, using H2SO4 and water, and then heating. Alternatively, in basic conditions, like with NaOH and water, followed by acidification.

Wait, but the starting material is a secondary alcohol (the -OH is on the same carbon as the CN). So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, the alcohol would become a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carboxylic acid.

So, for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, which conditions are used? I think the typical reagent is H2O with an acid catalyst. For example, H2SO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, using HCl as a catalyst in aqueous conditions.

So perhaps in the presence of HCl (as a catalyst), the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. So reagent B would be HCl. Or could it be another acid? Or perhaps it's an oxidizing agent in acidic conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions. So perhaps B is HCl, which would provide the acidic environment. Alternatively, maybe HCl is the acid catalyst.

So looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl. So if B is HCl, then the correct option would be either A or C. Let's see what the other parts are.

Wait, but let's recap:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the acid catalyst. So options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Which is more likely?

Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. So in the first reaction, forming a cyanohydrin, the conditions are typically acidic. So for the formation of the cyanohydrin, NaCN and a strong acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ would be used. So A is probably H3O+.

So, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So for option A, B is HCl; option B has B as CH3COOH.

So now, for the second reaction, the reagent B is adding H2O, perhaps with an acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, as in option A, then the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid in acidic conditions. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, perhaps that's a milder acid, but would it be enough?

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of HCl, the nitrile is protonated, leading to the attack of water and forming the amide intermediate, which then further hydrolyzes to the acid.

So if B is HCl, that would make sense. So for the second reaction, B is HCl, which would be option A (since A is H3O+ and B is HCl).

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So that would make option A the correct pair.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done using a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. For example, KMnO4 under acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids. But the question says the reagent is H2O with B. So perhaps B is an oxidizing agent, but the options don't include any oxidizing agents. So maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction uses H2O with HCl as the acid. So HCl as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.

So putting it all together: first reaction (A) is H3O+, second reaction (B) is HCl. So option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me check the products again. The first reaction product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide added to the ketone, making a secondary alcohol and nitrile on the same carbon. So the conditions for that are acid-catalyzed.

The second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to an OH group. So the structure is (HO)(R)C-CN. Wait, but in the product, it's (HO)(R)C-COOH. So the CN becomes COOH.

So, in this case, the nitrile is being oxidized. Wait, but nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. So perhaps the reaction is an oxidation.

Wait, but if the nitrile is attached to a carbon that's already bearing an OH group, then the oxidation might be straightforward. So the reagent could be something like HCl (as a catalyst) with H2O, or perhaps another oxidizing agent.

But looking at the options again, the only options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, or perhaps something else. So in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So, if the second reaction is hydrolysis, then using HCl would be appropriate as the acid catalyst. So for that, option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) would be correct.

Wait, but wait: the first reaction uses A, which is H3O+, to help generate the cyanide from NaCN. Wait, no: NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in the presence of an acid, like H3O+, would that help? Because NaCN is a salt; in an acidic solution, it would stay as CN- and Na+.

Wait, but NaCN is a weak base because CN- is a weak base, so in an acidic solution, it can stay as CN- ions. So adding H3O+ (acid) would help in protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which facilitates the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So the first reaction requires an acidic aqueous solution, which is provided by H3O+ (option A's A is H3O+).

So if that's correct, then for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then the nitrile would hydrolyze in acidic conditions to the carboxylic acid.

Therefore, the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility: could the second reaction be using a different catalyst?

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis using an acid like CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weaker acid compared to HCl. Would it be enough to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid?

Hmm. The hydrolysis of nitriles is often done under more vigorous conditions, like with H2SO4 and heat. But if the reagent is H2O and the catalyst is HCl, perhaps that's sufficient.

So I'm leaning towards option A being correct.

Another angle: looking at the reagents for the second reaction. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the solution must be acidic after the reaction. So if B is HCl, that would create an acidic solution, which is necessary for the formation of the carboxylic acid. If B were CH3COOH, that's a weak acid, but perhaps it's enough.

Wait, but the presence of HCl would also act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is oxidized in the presence of HCl and water. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions for that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or some other mechanism, but I think hydrolysis is the way to go.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile.  
   - The reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin.  
   - Acidic conditions are typically required to facilitate this reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.  
   - Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent A for this reaction.  

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the conversion of the nitrile group (CN) into a carboxylic acid (COOH).  
   - Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions.  
   - Since the product is a carboxylic acid, an acidic environment is preferred. HCl is a strong acid that can act as a catalyst for this hydrolysis, making it the most suitable reagent B.  

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ provides the acidic conditions needed for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1.  
  - HCl provides the acidic environment for the nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  
  - This option is consistent with the requirements of both reactions.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is suitable for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) may not provide the strong acidic conditions needed for the nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺ and is less effective for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as they satisfy the requirements for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
