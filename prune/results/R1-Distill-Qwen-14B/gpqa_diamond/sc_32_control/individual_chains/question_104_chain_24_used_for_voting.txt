Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

Alright, so there are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. Their orbits are circular.

The main point seems to be about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of the stars. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves in response to the planet's gravity, and that causes the spectral lines to shift. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period or velocity.

Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? I think there's a formula involving the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but maybe I can think about it differently.

Wait, another approach. The RV method's signal (the velocity semi-amplitude K) depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But since the planets have the same mass and the stars are the same, the difference in K (the velocity shift) should relate to their orbital periods.

The relation comes from the equation for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π/P) ) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recall the formula correctly. Oh right, K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, but in this setup, both planets have the same mass, and both stars have the same mass. So the only variables left that affect K are P, the orbital period. So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). Because if you look at the equation, as P increases, K decreases.

Wait, so K is proportional to P^(-1/3). Because the equation is K ∝ (1/ P )^(1/3), so K ∝ P^(-1/3).

So if K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write that correctly.

Hmm, let me think again. Suppose K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So if K2 is larger than K1, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1, because K is inversely related to cube root of P.

Wait, but in this problem, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7. So K2 is larger than K1. So according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. Because a bigger K implies a smaller P.

Wait, but what's the question? The question is how many times longer is P2 than P1, i.e., P2 / P1 = ?

No, wait, no. The question says, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So it's P2/P1.

But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3).

Wait, let's get the variables right.

Let me denote:

K1: velocity semi-amplitude of planet 1.

K2: velocity semi-amplitude of planet 2.

We have K1 = 5, K2 =7. So K2 > K1.

We can write the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Because from K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, because K1 = (something) * P1^(-1/3), K2 = (something) * P2^(-1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )

We can rearrange that to find the ratio of P2 to P1.

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's compute that.

K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (P2/P1) = (0.714)^3 ≈ ?

Calculating 0.714 cubed: 0.714 * 0.714 = approx 0.51. Then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which is the same as P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait no, wait, wait.

Wait no, the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So it's P2 / P1.

But according to our calculation, P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So that means P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364, so P2 is about 36% of P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer at all. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should write it differently.

K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = C * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = C * (1/P2^(1/3)).

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So to find P2/P1, we cube (5/7).

(5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36.

Wait, so that means P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's orbital period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer. But the question is how many times longer. So if P2 is shorter, it's less than 1 times, but the options have 0.36 as option A.

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's P2/P1 = approx 0.36, which is 0.36 times. So P2 is about 36% of P1. So planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is: how many times longer is P2 than P1? So since it's shorter, it's 0.36 times as long, so the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up the ratio.

Wait, the ratio K1/K2 is (5/7), which is about 0.714. So (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7. So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the ratio of P2 to P1 is 0.36, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A, approximately 0.36.

The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which corresponds to the observed spectral line shift, is related to the orbital period \( P \) by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of \( P \). For two planets with the same mass orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 < P_1 \), the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:
