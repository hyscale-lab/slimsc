Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that this model combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic molecule would be the v=0 and J=0 state, I think. The next state would involve transitioning to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So what's the next state after the fundamental?

In the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. For rotation-vibration, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The next state after the fundamental would probably be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which one requires less energy? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy to switch states, so it's probably the one with the least energy increment.

Wait, no. The problem says the molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the molecule transitions to the next state that's higher in energy but the smallest possible increase. So the photon must provide the energy difference between the current state and the next one.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1) or the first rotational excited state (J=1). I think the vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than the rotational ones. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the vibrational energy spacing is given by (1/2)hω, right? Or wait, the energy levels for vibration are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) hω. So the spacing between v=0 and v=1 is hω. For rotation, the energy is EJ = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So for J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by B (2*1 +1 - 0) = 2B. Wait, no. Because EJ for J=0 is 0, and J=1 is B*2. So the spacing is 2B. Wait, no: EJ = (J)(J+1) B. So from J=0 to J=1, EJ increases by (1*2 - 0) B = 2B.

Which one is smaller, hω or 2B? That depends on the values of B and ω.

Given that in the problem, ω is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute hω. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So hω is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, I need to find B for the rotational part. B is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², and μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, let's compute that. The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me compute that. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3, so about 3e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27. Let's see: 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, and 0.018 *1.66 ≈ 0.03. So total about 3.018e-27 kg? Hmm, maybe I should calculate precisely.

Alternative approach: 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg. Wait no, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me compute the exact value.

Wait, 20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ 3.321078e-26 kg.

Similarly, 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.321078e-27 kg.

So Mx = 3.321e-26 kg, My = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.321e-26 * 1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = Let me compute 3.321 *3.321 = approx 11.02, and exponents: 1e-26 *1e-27 = 1e-53.

So numerator ≈ 11.02e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.102e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ (1.102 / 3.6531) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.3 * 1e-26 = 3e-27 kg.

Wait, more accurately: 1.102 /3.6531 is about 0.3. So μ is approximately 3e-27 kg.

Now, I is μ r². r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * (2e-10)^2 = (3e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) = 12e-47 kg·m².

Wait, 3e-27 *4e-20 = 12e-47 kg·m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is hbar, which is h/(2π). h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (J² s²).

Wait, 1.05457e-34 squared is approximately (1.05^2)=1.1025, so 1.1025e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = (1.1025e-68) / (2 * 12e-47) ) 

Wait, denominator is 2 * I = 2 * 12e-47 = 24e-47 = 2.4e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.1025e-68) / (2.4e-46) ) ≈ (1.1025 / 2.4) * 1e-22 = approx 0.459 *1e-22 ≈ 4.59e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute the division: 1.1025 /2.4 → approx 0.459.

So B ≈ 4.59e-23 J.

Wait, but let's see, what's hω? Earlier, I found hω is 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing B and hω: hω is about 2.65e-19 J, B is 4.59e-23 J. So hω is much larger than B. So the vibrational energy spacing is much bigger than the rotational.

So the next state after the fundamental would be a higher vibrational state. Because to get the next state with the lowest possible energy, you have to consider the smallest possible energy jump. Oh wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which state is the next in energy: either the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (v=0, J=1).

But since hω is much larger than B (by about 5 orders of magnitude), the rotational transition would require less energy. So the molecule would first transition to the next rotational state before considering a vibrational transition.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination, so the order is more complex. But the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state is either rotational or vibrational.

But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference. Let's calculate the energy difference for the J transition.

In rotational states, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1) for J = 0,1,2,...

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_1 - E_0 = B*(1*2) = 2B. So 2 * 4.59e-23 = 9.18e-23 J.

But wait, wait, the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between two states. So perhaps the transition is to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could be a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (v=0, J=1).

But since 2B is 9.18e-23 J and hν (photon energy) for vibrational transition is hω = 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger. So the molecule would preferentially make a rotational transition if possible.

Wait, but wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. So, from J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by 2B. So the photon's energy would need to be 2B.

But if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy is either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The energy of (v=0, J=1) is 2B, which is about 9e-23 J. The energy of (v=1, J=0) is hω/2 (since Ev = (v + 1/2) hω, so the difference between v=0 and v=1 is hω). So the photon's energy must match the lower of these two, which is 2B.

Wait, but wait, that's not exactly right. The energy of the state with v=1, J=0 is Ev = (1 + 1/2) hω = 3/2 hω. So the energy difference from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) is (3/2 hω) - (1/2 hω) )= hω.

The energy of the state (v=0, J=1) is EJ = 2B. So if 2B < hω, then the molecule would first transition to J=1. Otherwise, it would transition to v=1.

So let's compute 2B and hω. 2B is about 9.18e-23 J. hω is 2.65e-19 J. Since 9e-23 is much less than 2.65e-19, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the molecule would transition to the next rotational state before considering a vibrational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference, which is 2B. So the photon energy E_photon = 2B = 9.18e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/c.

So the photon's momentum p is (2B) / c.

Wait, let me calculate that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.18e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.18e-23) / (3e8) ) N·s.

Wait, because 1 J = 1 N·m, and 1 N·s is the same as 1 J·s (since N·s = (kg·m/s²) * s )= kg·m/s = momentum unit). So 1 J = 1 N·m. So E = p c → p = E/(c).

So 9.18e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.18e-23) / 3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, that's 3.06e-31 kg·m/s. But wait, that's 3.06e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute the exact number. 9.18e-23 / 3e8 = (9.18 /3 ) * 1e-31 = 3.06 * 1e-31 = 3.06e-31 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Hmm, looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Wait, 3.06e-31 is way smaller than these options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated B. Let me double-check the B calculation.

B = ħ²/(2I). I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r².

Wait, let me recompute μ more accurately.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu)(2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605) ) = approx 2.9889 + 0.0299 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Then, 2I = 2 * 1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ (1.112 /2.415) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B is 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Then photon energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

So p = E_photon / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.06666e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, so that's approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But looking at options:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's way bigger than my result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should consider the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the allowed transitions are when ΔJ = ±1 and Δv varies.

But in the context of the problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 or v=1. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the molecule is in its ground vibrational state, and the next state is the next vibrational state, which is v=1, J=0.

Wait, but earlier we saw that the energy required for J=1 is 2B, which is much less than hω. So the molecule would transition to J=1 instead.

But if the problem is specifically about the vibrational transition, perhaps it's assuming that the photon is absorbed to cause a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. Or perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the combination of both.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is only considering the rotational part, but the question says rotation-vibration model.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, but when a photon is absorbed, it can go to the next higher state, which would be a combination of higher J and higher v. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the one with the smallest energy increment.

So in that case, the photon's energy must match the smallest possible energy difference. Therefore, the molecule would transition to either J=1 (energy 2B) or v=1 (energy hω). Since 2B is smaller, the photon's energy would be 2B.

But then the momentum would be E/c = 2B/c = (2*(ħ²/(2I)) )/c = (ħ²/(I c)).

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Because sometimes, in certain models, the first transition is the vibrational one. Maybe I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B or I.

Let me re-calculate I. I = μ r².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Thus, I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) .

Compute ħ²: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So denominator is 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is ~9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 N·s.

But wait, this is 3.06e-31 N·s, which is not among the options. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which is v=1, J=0. So the energy difference is hω. Then the photon's energy is hω.

Wait, but we found hω is 2.65e-19 J. So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28, which are smaller than that.

Wait, 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

But that's not among the options either. The closest is option A at 1.9e-28, but it's about half of that.

Hmm, perhaps the selection rule for vibrational transition is that the change is Δv = ±1, and the rotational can change by ΔJ = ±1, ±2. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first overtone or something else. But I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the energy difference but about the photon providing the necessary angular momentum. No, the question is about momentum in terms of p = E/c.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in B.

Wait, let me recalculate B.

I = μ r² = ( (20 *2)/(22) ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should include more precise values.

Let me recompute μ:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.8181818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.8181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ Let me compute that.

1.8181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 = let me compute 1.818 *1.660539.

1.8 *1.660539 = 2.98897.

0.018 *1.660539 = ~0.02989.

So total is approx 2.98897 + 0.02989 ≈ 3.01886e-27 kg.

So I = 3.01886e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01886e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20754e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.20754e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2*1.20754e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.415 ) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Thus, 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E_photon / c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s → 3.066e-31 N·s.

But the options are much larger than this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. What if the fundamental state refers to the ground state of vibration, meaning v=0, but J can vary.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is J=1, v=0.

So the energy difference is 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But then, as before, p = 3e-31 N·s, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which requires an energy of hν = hω. So let me compute that.

hν = hω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this. So perhaps I miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy required for the molecule to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). The energy for (v=0, J=1) is 2B, and for (v=1, J=0) is hω.

Since 2B is much smaller than hω, the molecule would prefer to transition to J=1.

But the problem states that the photon's momentum should switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the answer would correspond to 2B.

But according to my calculations, this is leading to a p of ~3e-31, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question models the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the rotational energy is to be considered. But the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy. The next state in energy would be the first excited state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The one with lower energy is (v=0, J=1), so the photon's energy should match the energy difference between these two states.

So E_photon = 2B.

But then the momentum is 3e-31 N·s, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the model is considering only the vibrational part, so the photon's energy is hω.

Wait, that would give p = 8.8e-28 N·s, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, and I made a mistake in calculating the energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy in terms of the quantum harmonic oscillator. So the energy levels are Ev = (v + 1/2)hω. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is hω.

So the photon's energy must be hω, giving p = hω /c.

hω is 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.8e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, which is about a quarter of that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational-vibrational coupling and the next state is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate hω/c.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

ω = 4e14 rad/s.

hω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Still, none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the rotational energy and find the momentum.

But wait, another approach: the photon's energy must correspond to the rotational transition. So E_photon = 2B.

So p = 2B / c.

But 2B is 9.2e-23 J, so p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 N·s.

Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational state's energy, but I'm getting that the photon momentum is 8.8e-28 N·s, but the closest option is A)1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of hω.

Wait, no, h is 6.626e-34, times 4e14 is 2.65e-19.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the photon's linear momentum, which is p = E/c, but perhaps the energy is not just the rotational or vibrational but the combination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state, which includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 1.1e-27 N·s.

Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is 20*2/(20+2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 1.81818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So 1.81818 amu = 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = let me compute 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, 0.01818 *1.6605≈0.03015. So total ≈ 3.01905e-27 kg.

r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.01905e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.20762e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

2I = 2 *1.20762e-46 = 2.41524e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41524e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s =3.066e-31 N·s.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which ignores bond length changes, but the given bond length is fixed. So perhaps the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require hω. So the photon's momentum is hω/c, which is 8.83e-28 N·s.

But that's not an option. The only option close is option A, 1.9e-28, which is about 0.214 *8.83e-28. That would imply that we're considering only a quarter of hω. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the zero-point energy.

Wait, the ground state (v=0) has energy (1/2) hω. So the first excited state (v=1) has (3/2) hω. So the difference is hω.

So the photon's energy is hω, which is 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, no option matches. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which includes both a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first excited state as the first rotation state, and the photon's energy is 2B, but I can't find the matching option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C: 1.1e-27 N·s.

Let me compute what that would correspond to.

p =1.1e-27 N·s.

E_photon = p * c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-20 J.

Which is 3.3e-20 J.

Hmm, 3.3e-20 J is about 3.3e-20 / (1.6e-19) ) =approx 0.206 eV.

But 3.3e-20 J is less than hω (which was 2.65e-19 J). Wait, no, 3.3e-20 is about a tenth of hω.

Wait, perhaps it's the energy for the first rotational state, but I thought 2B was 9.2e-23 J, which is much lower than this.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong model. Maybe the question is using the rigid rotor model, where the moment of inertia is fixed, and B is calculated as above.

But it's unclear why the calculated p doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=2. But that's a bigger energy jump. 2B would be the transition from J=0 to J=1, which is the lowest possible.

Wait, perhaps I should check all the options.

Option B is 2.3e-27 N·s.

E_photon =2.3e-27 *3e8 =6.9e-20 J.

Which would correspond to hν=6.9e-20 J.

hν =6.9e-20 =6.626e-34 * ν → ν=6.9e-20 /6.626e-34 ≈ 1.04e14 Hz.

But the given ω is 4e14 rad/s, which is 4e14/(2π) ≈6.37e13 Hz.

Hmm, that's lower than 1.04e14 Hz.

Alternatively, maybe the photon's energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

E_photon =6.9e-20 J =2B.

But earlier, 2B was 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller than 6.9e-20. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think of the energy of the photon as the vibrational energy hω.

p = hω /c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. That's about one-fifth of that. So perhaps the problem is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, but only accounting for the zero-point energy, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state of vibration (v=0) but in a higher rotational state. Suppose the molecule is in the J=0 state. The next state would be J=1, which requires 2B.

But again, that gives a p of 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, and the photon's energy must account for the change in both rotational and vibrational energy. But that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the selection rules for the quantum rotation-vibration model. The allowed transitions are typically Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. So the molecule can transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can transition to (v=1, J=1), which would require both a vibrational and rotational change.

But that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure about the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition and the photon's energy is hω.

But I can't find the corresponding option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but the linear momentum in the molecule's motion. No, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for the option that matches hω/c.

hω/c= 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

The closest option is option A, which is 1.9e-28. That's about 0.214 times my calculated value. 0.214 is approximately 1/4.67, but I'm not sure why that factor would come into play.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bond length or the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

Bond length r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) amu = (40/22) amu ≈1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2*1.207e-46) = 1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 = 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition, but the energy is not 2B but B( J=1 - J=0 ), which is (2 -0) * B =2B.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same point.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angular momentum. The photon's angular momentum is ħ, so p = ħ/(2 r) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which ignores the bond length's variation, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is related to the rotational energy's angular momentum.

Wait, the rotational energy EJ = (J(J+1) ) B.

Angular momentum L = J ħ.

The photon's momentum p must be such that it imparts angular momentum J ħ - 0 = J ħ.

But I'm not sure how that connects.

Wait, the photon's angular momentum is ħ. So to change J from 0 to 1, the photon must have angular momentum ħ. So p_photon must carry angular momentum ħ.

But the angular momentum of a photon is p × r, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the angular momentum of a photon is L = r × p. So if the photon is absorbed along the bond, then r is the bond length, and p is the photon's momentum, so L = r p.

But the required angular momentum is ħ. So r p = ħ → p = ħ/(r).

r is 2e-10 m.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So p =1.05457e-34 / 2e-10 =5.27e-25 kg·m/s =5.27e-25 N·s.

Looking at the options, this is close to option B:2.3e-27, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy in terms of p.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state and the photon's energy is hν = hω, which gives p = 8.83e-28 → which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next rotational state. So the photon's energy is 2B =9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 → which is much smaller than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reevaluate.

The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the ground state. After absorbing a photon, it should transition to the next lowest energy state, which, as per quantum mechanics, would be the first excited state.

The first excited state would have the lowest possible energy above the ground state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

As calculated earlier, 2B ≈9e-23 J, which is much less than hω ≈2.65e-19 J. So the molecule would transition to the next rotational state.

Thus, the photon's energy is 2B, and momentum is (2B)/c.

But according to my calculations, this leads to p=3.066e-31 N·s, which is not an option. So perhaps I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done in different units.

Wait, let me try calculating B again in a different way.

Bond length r = 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m.

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.8181818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.8181818 *1.660539e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ r²=3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ħ^2 = (1.0545718e-34)^2 =1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So, B =1.112e-68 / (2 *1.207e-46) =1.112e-68 /2.414e-46 ≈4.6e-23 J.

2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=2B/c=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.066e-31 kg·m/s=3.066e-31 N·s.

Not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 1.1e-27, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of hω.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s, ω=4e14 rad/s.

hω=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=hω/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options are:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

So option A is close to 8.8e-28 but about a factor of 4.6 smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c=3e8 m/s but I used a different value. No, c is about 3e8.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the photon's energy as (1/2)hω, which is the zero-point energy. But that doesn't make sense for a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should instead compute the photon's momentum as p = sqrt(2mE), but I'm not sure. That formula is for particles in a box, perhaps.

Wait, no, that's not applicable here.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 N·s, but I can't figure out why my calculations don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps I should try to calculate the photon's energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences. But that would be hω + 2B, which is way larger than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next possible state, which could be a combination of both, but that's getting too speculative.

Given that, I think I'm stuck. Based on calculations, the correct momentum should be 8.83e-28 N·s for a vibrational transition, but that's not an option. For a rotational transition, it's 3.06e-31 N·s, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is referring to the transition to the next vibrational state (v=1) but only the first rotational level (J=0), thus requiring an energy of hω.

But then the momentum is 8.83e-28 N·s, which isn't an option. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, such as the rigid rotor only, which ignores the vibrational part. In that case, the photon's energy is 2B, leading to p=3e-31 N·s. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the next state as the first vibrational state (v=1) with J=0, requiring energy hω.

But again, it doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the units. Let me check again.

Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20 amu is 3.321e-26 kg, and 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg. Then μ = (20*2)/(22) amu =40/22 amu=1.818 amu.

Thus, μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 =3.018e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=μ r² =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

B= (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.207e-46) =1.112e-68 /2.415e-46=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=2B/c=3.066e-31 N·s.

No matching option.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is A:1.9e-28 N·s, assuming the calculation was done with hν = hω, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the rotational transition, but the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. The vibrational period is T=2π/ω ≈1.57e-14 seconds.

The vibrational energy difference is hω=2.65e-19 J.

Photon's momentum p = hω/c.

But perhaps the question used a different value for h or c.

Let me recalculate using c=3e8 m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

hω=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N·s.

If the option A is 1.9e-28, perhaps it's a miscalculation by a factor of 4 or something.

Wait, perhaps the problem considered the rotational transition, but I think my earlier calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=2, which would require 6B.

Then p=6B/c= (6 *4.6e-23)/3e8=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 N·s.

But that's even smaller than before.

Hmm.

Given that, I think I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculations, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next state, which is the first vibrational state. So the photon's energy is hω.

Then p = hω/c =8.83e-28 N·s.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ω. Let me check.

In the problem, w =4e14 rad/s. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as a vibrational transition, but the question is about the photon's linear momentum, which is E/c.

Thus, p= hω/c=8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match this, so perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the answer in terms of kg·m/s.

Wait, no, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia as (Mx My)/(Mx + My) * r².

Wait, yeah, that's what I did.

Another possibility is that the bond length is given as R =2 angstroms, which I used correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy required to transition to the next vibrational state, which is v=1, and the photon's energy is hω.

Thus, p = hω/c =8.83e-28 N·s.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27.

Wait, 1.1e-27 N·s would correspond to E=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-20 J.

So perhaps I should check what that would imply.

3.3e-20 J is the photon's energy.

So, if E_photon =3.3e-20 J, then p=3.3e-20 /3e8=1.1e-27 N·s.

Which is option C.

But where would that energy come from? It's much larger than 2B (9e-23 J) but smaller than hω (2.65e-19 J).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition to a higher vibrational state, but not the first one. Or perhaps it's a different model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

But given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to the step-by-step explanation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to find the photon's momentum that corresponds to the smallest energy difference to the next state.

### Key Calculations and Analysis:

1. **Energy Levels in the Quantum Model**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).
   - The rotational energy levels are quantized as \( E_J = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Reduced Mass (\( \mu \))**:
   - The reduced mass is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
   - Converting to kilograms: \( \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

3. **Moment of Inertia (\( I \))**:
   - The bond length is \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).
   - The moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]

4. **Rotational Constant (\( B \))**:
   - Using \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), the rotational constant is:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

5. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:
   - The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = B \cdot (1 \cdot 2) = 2B \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

6. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]

7. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:
   - The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the molecule will preferentially transition to the next rotational state.

8. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   - The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \):
     \[
     p = \frac{2B}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a mismatch between the calculations and the given choices.

9. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   - For \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \):
     \[
     p = \frac{h \omega}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - This value is also not directly listed among the options, but it is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **A**, as it is the closest to the calculated photon momentum for the vibrational transition. The discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

**Answer: A**
