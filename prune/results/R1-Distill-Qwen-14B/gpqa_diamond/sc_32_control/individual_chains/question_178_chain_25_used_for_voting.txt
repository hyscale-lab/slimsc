Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question gives me the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And they define σ_{μν} as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, right, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it affects renormalizability. A renormalizable theory has all interactions with coupling constants of positive or zero mass dimension, I think. Because higher dimensions would lead to nonrenormalizable terms which require an infinite number of counterterms or some sort of cutoff.

So first, I need to find [κ]_M. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime (since it's integrated over d^4x, so the Lagrangian density must be dimensionless? Wait, no, the action is dimensionless. So the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4, because in 4 dimensions, the action ∫ L d^4x is dimensionless, so L must have dimension [Mass]^4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So let's look at each term in L_int.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field has its own dimension. I remember that in 4 dimensions, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation has derivatives, and the action for the Dirac field is something like ∫ ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So i γ^μ ∂_μ has dimension 1, since ψ has dimension 3/2 each, and the product ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ would be 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. So yes, ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2.

What about the field strength tensor F^{μν}? The field strength comes from the electromagnetic field, or in this case, perhaps it's a non-Abelian field? Well, regardless, F^{μν} is typically the field strength tensor, which has the same dimension as the derivative of the gauge field. For electromagnetism, the gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1 (since the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, which has dimension 4, so (∂A) has dimension 2, so A has dimension 1). Then F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so it has dimension 2.

Wait, so F^{μν} would have dimension 2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The γ matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So each γ has mass dimension 0. The commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] would also have dimension 0. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each part's dimensions:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. ψ is 3/2. F is 2. σ is 0.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Multiply by F, which is 2: 3 + 2 =5. So the whole term has dimension 5.

But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must make up the difference. So the term is κ * (dim 5). So 5 + [κ]_M = 4 → [κ]_M = 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, so κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, for renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ the number of spacetime dimensions (d). In 4 dimensions, the critical dimension is d=4, so couplings must have [g]_M ≤4. Wait, but more precisely, in 4D, the mass dimension of a coupling in an interaction term is [g]_M = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions in the term). Because each field contributes its own dimension. So the term is g φ^n or whatever, and the dimension of g is 4 - (n * [φ]).

But here, the interaction term is L_int = g (ψ̄ ... ψ F ...). The dimension must be 4. So in our case, the term is dimensionless? No, wait, the Lagrangian itself must have dimension 4, so each term in it must have dimension 4.

Wait, when checking renormalizability, you look at the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Because the dimension of the coupling is [g]_M = 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions) + (derivatives or other factors? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.)

Wait, another approach: in a renormalizable theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4. Because the coupling constants are in front of terms that must have dimension 4. So the coupling must have a dimension such that when multiplied by the fields, the term has dimension 4.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. As before, the fields contribute 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the term 4.

But wait, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have mass dimension ≥0. Because if [g] <0, then the term has higher dimension than 4, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

So κ has [κ]_M = -1, which is less than 0. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because [κ]<0 → not renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renorm. No, because [κ] would be positive, but our calculation says -1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. This sounds right.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No, because our κ is -1.

So the correct answer should be option C: mass dimension -1, not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields and operators
In 4-dimensional spacetime:
- The Dirac field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).
- The \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) operator, being a commutator of dimensionless \(\gamma\)-matrices, is dimensionless: \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. The term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) contributes:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + [ \bar{\psi} ]_M + [ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M + [ \psi ]_M + [ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + 4 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension \([g]_M \geq 0\). Here, \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), which is negative. This means the interaction term has a mass dimension greater than 4, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

### Step 4: Evaluate options
- **Option A**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the negative dimension implies nonrenormalizability.
- **Option B**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the calculated dimension is \(-1\).
- **Option C**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the calculated dimension is \(-1\).

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
