Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄³⁻) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that orthophosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The salts provided here are KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄. The first is the diprotic form (H₂PO₄⁻), and the second is the hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻). But wait, when these salts dissolve in water, they dissociate. So, KH₂PO₄ would dissociate into K⁺, H₂PO₄⁻. And Na₂HPO₄ would give Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻.

Wait a second, but HPO₄²⁻ can actually come from H₂PO₄⁻, right? Because H₂PO₄⁻ can lose a proton to become HPO₄²⁻. So, in this solution, we have both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to the HPO₄²⁻ ions. Or wait, sometimes orthophosphate is HPO₄³-? No, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's deprotonated. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the different phosphate species: H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (phosphate). So, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's usually in the form of H2PO4⁻, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-, depending on the pH.

But in this problem, the solution contains H2PO4⁻ from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, when these two are mixed, they form a buffer solution because they are a conjugate acid-base pair. So, the H2PO4⁻ (acid) and HPO4^2- (base) can react to maintain the pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is usually H3PO4, but in solution, it's not present in large amounts because it's a weak acid and dissociates. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the terminology here.

Alternatively, sometimes orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^3- ion, but no, that's phosphate. Hmm, perhaps I should recheck that. Oh, wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. It can lose three protons to form H2PO4⁻, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- ions. So, the terms can get a bit confusing.

But in any case, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I think the intended answer is the HPO4^2- concentration because that's the species present from the Na2HPO4.

Wait, but the salts are providing both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- ions. So, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, and the concentration of each ion can be determined, but since the question is about orthophosphate (which I'm interpreting as HPO4^2-), we can calculate it from the moles contributed by Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, but wait a second. When both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are dissolved in water, the solution will contain both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- ions. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to the HPO4^2- ion.

So, perhaps the orthophosphate ion concentration comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, so let's calculate that.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the contributions of each salt and then see the total concentration.

Wait, no. The solution is made by dissolving 1.00 g of each salt into 200 cm³ of solution. So, each salt contributes their own ions.

So, first, let me compute the moles of each.

For KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

When each salt dissolves, they dissociate as follows:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
So, moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O (so, HPO4^2- is produced).
So, moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005617 mol.

Wait, but wait. The solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

But the problem is that these two ions can interconvert via the second dissociation of H3PO4. So, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. The Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So, the solution is a buffer solution of H2PO4^-/HPO4^2- with Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm assuming is HPO4^2-.

But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, "the concentration of orthophosphate ions," but orthophosphate is H3PO4. But since H3PO4 is a weak acid, it's not present in significant amounts in solution. Instead, it's mainly in the form of its conjugate bases.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: Orthophosphate (HPO4^3-) is another form, but that's when it's lost three protons. Wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. When it loses one proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), second loss gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), third loss gives PO4^3- (phosphate).

So, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^3-? Wait, no, that's phosphate. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe "orthophosphate" refers to the HPO4^2- ion, as that's the form that's considered in the salts given.

Wait, the salts are KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

So, if I just calculate the moles from Na2HPO4, then divide by the volume, that would give the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, when you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, they can interconvert, so the actual concentration of HPO4^2- might not just be from the Na2HPO4 because some H2PO4^- can deprotonate into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that's the buffer situation. The buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) can help find the pH, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just straightforward, and because both salts are present, the concentrations of the ions are additive. So, the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4. So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005617 mol in 0.2 L, which is 0.028085 M.

But the question is about the orthophosphate ion. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are all in the 1e-7 range, which is much lower than 0.028 M. So, that suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Ah, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is about the total concentration of orthophosphate ions, considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- and the presence of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion (HPO4^2-) is present in solution, but some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is more than just from Na2HPO4 because some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in a buffer solution, the concentrations are in equilibrium. So, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, let me calculate the pH first.

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

The concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when you dissolve the salts, the solution will have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.028085)/(0.036675) ≈ 0.766.

Taking the log: log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So, pH = 7.208 + (-0.114) = 7.094.

But wait, the pH is around 7.1. Now, to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The HPO4^2- comes from two sources: the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait no, no, because the H2PO4^- is in solution, and some of it will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-.

So, the total concentration of HPO4^2- is from both the Na2HPO4 and the H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, but actually, the total phosphate species is H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is at the second dissociation (Ka2) pH.

So, the buffer equation applies: pH = pKa2 + log([A2-]/[HA-]), where HA- is H2PO4^- and A2- is HPO4^2-.

So, plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.208 + log(0.028085 / 0.036675) ≈ 7.208 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution. Wait, but perhaps the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which in the presence of H2PO4^- will adjust according to the pH.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then we need to find [HPO4^2-], considering both the initial contribution from Na2HPO4 and the additional from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to calculate the concentration as per the moles from each salt, without considering further dissociation. But that would give [HPO4^2-] as ~0.028 M, but the options are much lower.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the buffer equation.

Wait, but the HPO4^2- comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-. So, the total [HPO4^2-] is the sum of the initial contribution and that from dissociation.

Let me model it as:

Let’s denote the initial concentration of H2PO4^- as [H2PO4^−]₀ = 0.036675 M.

The initial [HPO4^2−]₀ = 0.028085 M.

In solution, some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2−:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2− + H+

The equilibrium expression is Ka2 = [HPO4^2−][H+]/[H2PO4^-].

But since the solution is buffered, the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations, so [H+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-7.094} ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So, let's plug into the Ka2 equation:

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2−] * [H+] ) / [H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2−] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+]

But wait, [HPO4^2−] is not just the initial amount from Na2HPO4, because some H2PO4^- dissociates. So, perhaps the total [HPO4^2−] is the sum of the initial contribution and the amount produced from H2PO4^-.

Let me denote x as the additional HPO4^2− formed from H2PO4^−. So:

[HPO4^2−] = [HPO4^2−]₀ + x.

[H2PO4^-] = [H2PO4^-]₀ - x.

But at the same time, the pH is determined by the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log( ([HPO4^2−]₀ + x ) / ([H2PO4^-]₀ - x) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the Henderson equation, since the buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−, the ratio of their concentrations determines the pH.

Wait, but if the solution has [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2−] = 0.028085 M, then the pH as calculated earlier is ~7.094.

But the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2−, which, according to the Henderson equation, should be higher than 0.028085 M because H2PO4^- is donating some to form more HPO4^2−.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A2−]/[HA−]).

So, [A2−] is HPO4^2−, and [HA−] is H2PO4^−.

The initial [A2−] is 0.028085 M, and [HA−] is 0.036675 M.

So, according to the equation, [A2−] = [HA−] * 10^{pH - pKa2}.

So, [A2−] = 0.036675 * 10^{7.094 - 7.208} = 0.036675 * 10^{-0.114} ≈ 0.036675 * 0.766 ≈ 0.02808 M.

Wait, that brings us back to the initial value. So, perhaps the [HPO4^2−] is indeed 0.028085 M. But this doesn't account for the H2PO4^- dissociating into more HPO4^2−, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of charge balance. The solution must be electrically neutral, so the sum of cations equals the sum of anions.

The solution contains K+ and Na+ from the salts. Let me calculate the total cations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So, moles of K+ = 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2− + 2 H2O.

So, moles of Na+ = 0.005617 * 2 ≈ 0.011234 mol.

Total cations: K+ (0.007335) + Na+ (0.011234) = 0.018569 mol.

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.007335 mol) and HPO4^2− (0.005617 mol), plus any other anions from water, but water's contribution is negligible.

But the charge from anions is: [H2PO4^-] * 1 + [HPO4^2−] * 2.

Because each H2PO4^- contributes -1, and each HPO4^2− contributes -2.

So, total negative charge is 0.007335 * 1 + 0.005617 * 2 = 0.007335 + 0.011234 = 0.018569 mol.

Which equals the total positive charge (0.018569 mol). So, charge balance is satisfied.

But how does this help? Well, perhaps I can model the situation using the equilibrium expressions.

So, the total phosphate species in solution is:

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2−] + [PO4^3−] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2−] (since PO4^3− is negligible due to very low Ka3).

So, the total phosphate concentration is 0.036675 + 0.028085 = 0.06476 M.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.

Another approach: since the solution is a buffer, the concentration of HPO4^2− can be found using the Henderson equation. Wait, but the Henderson equation already relates the pH to the ratio of the two concentrations. So, perhaps the concentrations are as follows.

Wait, considering that the ratio is [HPO4^2−]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^{pH - pKa2}.

So, [HPO4^2−] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^{pH - pKa2}.

We have [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.

But pH is 7.094, pKa2 is 7.208.

So, 10^{7.094 -7.208} = 10^{-0.114} ≈ 0.766.

So, [HPO4^2−] = 0.036675 * 0.766 ≈ 0.02808 M.

Which matches our initial calculation. So, perhaps the [HPO4^2−] is 0.02808 M.

But wait, the options are in the 1e-7 range. So, this approach suggests that the concentration is about 0.028 M, but the options are all around 1e-7 M.

This suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about HPO4^2− but about PO4^3−, but that's even less likely because PO4^3− is much less in concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of H3PO4 (orthophosphoric acid), which is the undissociated form. But in solution, H3PO4 dissociates, so its concentration is very low.

But how would I calculate that?

Wait, if the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−, then the concentration of H3PO4 would be determined by the first dissociation, but the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2− complicates this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2−, but under the assumption that it's in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and H+.

Wait, perhaps I can use the second dissociation equation, H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2− + H+, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So, the equilibrium expression is:

Ka2 = [HPO4^2−][H+] / [H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [HPO4^2−] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+].

But [H+] is 1e-7 (approximate pH 7?), but earlier calculation said pH is about 7.09, so [H+] is about 8.2e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute [H+] accurately.

pH = 7.094 → [H+] = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.17e-8 M.

So, plugging the values:

[HPO4^2−] = (6.2e-8) * (0.036675) / (8.17e-8) 

Let me compute that.

Numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.036675 ≈ 2.270e-9.

Denominator: 8.17e-8.

So, 2.270e-9 / 8.17e-8 ≈ 0.02775 M.

Which is approximately 0.02775 M, but this is close to our previous value, which suggests that perhaps this approach isn't giving a different result.

Wait, but this is confusing because the options suggest a much lower concentration. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2− considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, [HPO4^2−] is determined by the Henderson equation, not by the initial concentrations. So, the initial concentrations get adjusted based on the pH.

Wait, but earlier, using the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2−] is 0.028 M, which is about 2.8e-2 M. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So, I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total concentration of phosphate species. But that's not directly applicable to the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where both salts are present, but considering that some H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2−, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate ions.

Wait, the total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2−, and PO4^3−. But in solution, H3PO4 is negligible, PO4^3− is negligible, so total phosphate is approximately [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2−].

But the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm not exactly clear on. If orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2− ion, then perhaps the answer is the concentration we've calculated, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where the pH is determined by the buffer, and after considering all the dissociation steps, but I'm not seeing how that would lead to an answer in the 1e-7 range.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3−, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2−.

But that's even less likely, as PO4^3− is much less in concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2−, but considering that some of it comes from H2PO4^-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model this properly.

Let’s denote:

Initial moles of H2PO4^-: n_H2PO4 = 0.007335 mol.

Initial moles of HPO4^2−: n_HPO4 = 0.005617 mol.

But in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate to HPO4^2−. Let’s let x be the moles of H2PO4^- that dissociate into HPO4^2−.

So, at equilibrium:

n_H2PO4 = 0.007335 - x.

n_HPO4 = 0.005617 + x.

But also, the solution is buffered, so using the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log( (n_HPO4) / (n_H2PO4) )

Which is the same as:

pH = pKa2 + log( (0.005617 + x) / (0.007335 - x) )

But we can calculate the pH using the initial concentrations before any dissociation happens.

Wait, but that approach might not be accurate because the dissociation affects both.

Alternatively, perhaps using the initial concentrations to find the pH, then using that pH to find the actual [HPO4^2−].

Let me compute the pH as before:

pH = 7.208 + log(0.028085 / 0.036675) = 7.208 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Now, using this pH, we can compute the actual [HPO4^2−].

But earlier calculation gave [HPO4^2−] ≈ 0.028 M, which is much higher than any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

For KH2PO4:

Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer solution but a solution where the two salts are present, leading to the formation of HPO4^2− from H2PO4^-.

But even so, unless some HPO4^2− is converted back, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution that is not buffered, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is considering the hydrolysis of both salts. For example, KH2PO4 is a weak acid, and Na2HPO4 is a weak base. So, when dissolved in water, they might undergo hydrolysis.

But that's a more complicated approach, and I'm not sure if that's what's expected here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2− in the solution after considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the charge balance equation.

The charge balance equation is:

[K+] + [Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2−] + [OH^-]

But since the solution is neutral, and pH is around 7, [OH^-] is about 1e-7, which is negligible.

So, [K+] + [Na+] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2−].

Calculating the concentrations:

[K+] = 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

[Na+] = (0.005617 mol * 2) / 0.2 L = 0.05617 M.

So, [K+] + [Na+] = 0.036675 + 0.05617 = 0.092845 M.

On the anion side:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.028085 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2−] = 0.036675 + 2*(0.028085) = 0.036675 + 0.05617 = 0.092845 M.

Which matches [K+] + [Na+], so the charge balance holds. So, that suggests that the concentrations are correct.

But the problem is that none of the options are near 0.028 M. So, I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is HPO4^3−, but that's very unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem states that the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL, or 0.2 L.

So, for KH2PO4:

Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Concentration = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

Concentration = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the concentration in the solution, but about the solubility or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles of HPO4^2−.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is not in a buffer, but instead, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2− react to form H3PO4, but that's not the case under normal circumstances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the given salts are not providing the same stoichiometry as I thought.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the moles of HPO4^2− are not just 0.005617 mol, because when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves, it releases HPO4^2− along with water.

Wait, no, the formula Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2− + 2 H2O. So, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2−. So, that part is correct.

Hmm, I’m stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration of HPO4^2−, but about the concentration of H3PO4 (orthophosphoric acid), which is in equilibrium with H2PO4^-.

But that would require considering the first dissociation, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2− are present, and the solution is buffered.

But with all that, I still can't get the concentration down to 1e-7 M.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is undergoing hydrolysis, and the actual concentration of HPO4^2− is lower because some of it is protonated or deprotonated.

But in that case, the buffer solution would adjust to the pH where the concentrations are as they are.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the concentration of HPO4^2− as being determined by the second dissociation.

Wait, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2− + H+, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2− would be determined by this equilibrium.

But in the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−, the solution is buffered, and the [HPO4^2−] is determined by the initial concentrations and the pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the concentration of HPO4^2− in solution, which is the sum of the initial HPO4^2− and the amount formed from H2PO4^-.

But how do I find that?

Maybe using the expression:

Ka2 = [HPO4^2−][H+] / [H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [HPO4^2−] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

But [H+] is determined by the pH, which we can calculate using the Henderson equation.

Wait, but to use the Henderson equation, we need the ratio [HPO4^2−]/[H2PO4^-], which we can find using the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write:

[HPO4^2−] = (Ka2 / [H+]) * [H2PO4^-]

So, substituting the values.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

[H+] = 1e-7 (approx, since pH ~7).

So, [HPO4^2−] = (6.2e-8 / 1e-7) * [H2PO4^-] = (0.62) * [H2PO4^-]

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036675 M.

So, [HPO4^2−] ≈ 0.62 * 0.036675 ≈ 0.0227 M.

But this is still about 2.27e-2 M, which isn't matching the options.

Wait, but more accurately, [H+] is 8.17e-8, as calculated earlier.

So, [HPO4^2−] = (6.2e-8) * (0.036675) / (8.17e-8)

Calculating numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.036675 ≈ 2.27e-9.

Denominator: 8.17e-8.

So, 2.27e-9 / 8.17e-8 ≈ 0.02777 M.

Which is about 0.0278 M, which is close to the initial estimate.

But again, none of the options are anywhere near this, so I must be misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where only one of the salts is present, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is 200 cm³, but when the salts are dissolved, the volume changes. But that’s a minor effect, and the problem states the volume as 200 cm³, so I can ignore that.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, let me recheck:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.09.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 is approximately 178.

1 / 178 ≈ 0.0056179 mol. Correct.

So, the moles contributed are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3−, but that's even less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the options are for HPO4^2− in a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of HPO4^2− using the total phosphate concentration.

Wait, the total phosphate comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−.

Total phosphate (P) = (0.007335 + 0.005617) = 0.012952 mol.

In 0.2 L, this is 0.06476 M.

But the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2−, considering that some of it comes from H2PO4^- and some is present initially.

But I can't see a way that leads to the given options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the contribution of each salt to the HPO4^2− concentration.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let me think about the possible options. The options are in the 1e-7 range. So, perhaps the answer is option D: 3.97e-7 M.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the solution is not considering the buffer but the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in solution, considering their hydrolysis.

But HPO4^2− is a base, and in solution, it can hydrolyze:

HPO4^2− + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka3.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration using the hydrolysis of HPO4^2−.

But perhaps I should calculate the hydrolysis of HPO4^2− to form H2PO4^- and OH^-.

But since the solution is neutral, [OH^-] is about 1e-7.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the solution as a buffer and using the given Ka values to find the concentration of HPO4^2−.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a step I missed.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not at 25°C, but that's given as 25°C, so no effect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molarity of each ion and then find the concentration of HPO4^2− based on the buffer equation.

But I've tried that and it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where the two salts are mixed, but considering that the HPO4^2− can react with H2PO4^- to form H3PO4.

But that's not likely because the pH is around 7, and H3PO4 is a weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in the solution when the pH is determined by the buffer, but I still can't see how to get to 1e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration using the Ka2 and the initial concentrations.

Wait, let's set up the equilibrium.

The initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.028085 M.

But in reality, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2− and H+.

Let x be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociate.

So, at equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 - x.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.028085 + x.

[H+] = 1e-7 (approximate).

Ka2 = [HPO4^2−][H+] / [H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.

So,

6.2e-8 = (0.028085 + x) * 1e-7 / (0.036675 - x)

Multiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):

6.2e-8 (0.036675 - x) = (0.028085 + x) * 1e-7

Divide both sides by 1e-8:

0.62 (0.036675 - x) = (0.028085 + x) * 10

0.62 * 0.036675 = 0.0227055.

0.62 * (-x) = -0.62x.

On the right side: 0.028085 *10 = 0.28085, x *10 = 10x.

So,

0.0227055 - 0.62x = 0.28085 + 10x

Bring all terms to left:

0.0227055 - 0.62x -0.28085 -10x =0

Combine like terms:

(0.0227055 - 0.28085) + (-0.62x -10x)=0

-0.2581445 -10.62x =0

-10.62x = 0.2581445

x = -0.2581445 / 10.62 ≈ -0.0243 M.

Negative x doesn't make sense in this context, which suggests that my assumption that [H+] is 1e-7 is incorrect. Perhaps the [H+] is higher than that, which makes the equation work.

Alternatively, maybe I should not have approximated [H+] as 1e-7 but used the exact value from the buffer calculation.

Earlier, I calculated [H+] as 8.17e-8 M.

So, let me use that.

Ka2 = (0.028085 + x) * 8.17e-8 / (0.036675 - x) = 6.2e-8.

Multiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):

6.2e-8 (0.036675 - x) = (0.028085 + x) *8.17e-8.

Divide both sides by 1e-8:

6.2 (0.036675 - x) = (0.028085 + x) *8.17

Compute 6.2 *0.036675 ≈ 0.227055.

6.2*(-x) = -6.2x.

Right side: 0.028085 *8.17 ≈ 0.229208, x *8.17=8.17x.

So,

0.227055 -6.2x = 0.229208 +8.17x.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

-6.2x -8.17x = 0.229208 -0.227055.

-14.37x = 0.002153.

x ≈ 0.002153 / (-14.37) ≈ -0.00015 M.

Again, x is negative, which is not possible. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that [H+] is 8.17e-8 is incorrect, and I should instead solve the equation without assuming x is small.

But this is getting too complicated, and time is limited. I think I need to make a decision based on the given options.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where only one salt is present. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2− in a solution where both salts contribute, but considering that some HPO4^2− is converted back to H2PO4^-.

But I can't see a way to get such a low concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about HPO4^2− but about HPO4^3−, but that's even less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration using the formula for weak bases.

HPO4^2− is a weak base and can hydrolyze in water to form OH^-.

The Kb for HPO4^2− can be found using Kw / Ka3.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-12 ≈ 5.56e-3.

So, Kb = 5.56e-3.

The hydrolysis reaction is: HPO4^2− + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^-.

The concentration of HPO4^2− is 0.028085 M.

The Kb is 5.56e-3.

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration:

Kb = x² / [HPO4^2−]

x² = Kb * [HPO4^2−] =5.56e-3 * 0.028085 ≈ 1.561e-4.

x ≈ sqrt(1.561e-4) ≈ 0.0125 M.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 0.0125 M → pH ≈ 11.098.

But this would make the solution basic, which is not the case as the buffer pH was around 7.09.

So, perhaps this approach isn't correct either.

I'm stuck and can't figure out how to get the concentration down to 1e-7 M. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I can't see the steps to reach it.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in a solution containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) of water at 25 °C. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Key Analysis:
1. **Moles of Salts**:
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

2. **Initial Concentrations**:
   - KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, so:  
     \[
     [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of KH₂PO₄}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007335}{0.2} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}.
     \]
   - Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻, so:  
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Buffer Solution**:
   - The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} \right).
     \]
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208,
     \]
     \[
     \text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.028085}{0.036675} \right) \approx 7.208 - 0.114 \approx 7.094.
     \]

4. **Revisiting [HPO₄²⁻]**:
   - Using the equilibrium expression for the second dissociation:  
     \[
     K_a = \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}.
     \]
   - Rearranging for \([\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]\):  
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
     \]
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \approx 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.17 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M},
     \]
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (0.036675)}{8.17 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.02775 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated \([\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]\) is approximately \(0.02775 \, \text{M}\), which is much larger than the options provided (\(10^{-7} \, \text{M}\) range). This suggests a misunderstanding of the problem or an error in interpreting the question.

6. **Final Consideration**:
   - Given the options, the most plausible answer based on the provided data and reasoning is **D) 3.97×10⁻⁷ M**, though the steps to reach this value are unclear.

Answer: D
