Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving, so I think that complicates things.

So, the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction. Oh, right, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, but toward the observer. Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is also moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. Wait, but the glass is moving toward the observer, so the beam's direction from the source to the observer is the same as the glass's velocity.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of reference frames. The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is affected by the movement of the medium.

I remember that in special relativity, combining velocities isn't straightforward. Oh wait, but this is about light in a medium, not a vacuum. Hmm. So for a medium moving relative to the observer, how does that affect the speed of light within it?

Wait, when a medium is moving, the light's speed in that medium is still v = c/n, but from the lab frame, the speed might be different. Or does the medium's motion affect the light's speed as observed?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. In the rest frame of the glass, the light has speed c/n. But when the glass is moving, what's the observed speed in the lab frame?

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a problem where the medium is moving, and we're looking for the light's speed in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe the approach is to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, that's when the velocities are in the same direction. Oh, but the medium's velocity is v, and the light's speed in the medium's frame is v_light = c/n.

So the lab frame would see the light's speed as v' = (v_light + v) / (1 + (v_light * v)/c² )

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Because in this case, the medium's velocity is v, and the light's velocity in the medium is c/n. So we'd add the velocities relativistically.

Wait, let's think about it. Let me denote u' as the velocity of the light in the medium's frame. So u' = c/n. The medium is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So the lab frame would measure the light's speed as u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait a second. The medium is moving towards the observer, so the direction matters. If the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be higher than c/n, but perhaps that's not the case when considering relativity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to plug in the numbers. So u' is c/n, which is less than c because n>1.

So u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, wait that's a bit messy. Let me compute the denominator:

The denominator is 1 + (u' v ) / c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c).

So to compute u, it's (u' + v ) / denominator.

Wait, so the whole expression is [ (c/n + v ) ] / [ 1 + (v/(n c)) ]

Let me compute this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: c + n v

Denominator: n [ 1 + v/(n c) ] = n + v/c.

Wait, so u = (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

But that's not looking like any of the options. The options are in terms of n and v, not divided by c. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, perhaps the way I'm applying the velocity addition is incorrect. Because in this case, the medium is moving, but the light is in the medium. Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium when it's moving is different.

Wait, another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light propagates through the medium at speed c/n in the medium's frame. But because the medium is moving, perhaps the lab frame's observed speed is different.

Wait, but when the medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium is still c/n relative to the medium. So from the lab frame, it's the medium's velocity plus the light's velocity in the medium, but considering relativistic addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium is still c/n, regardless of the medium's movement. Wait, but that can't be right because that would violate relativity when the medium is moving at a significant fraction of c.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about another approach. The observer in the lab measures the speed of light. But according to special relativity, all observers measure the speed of light as c in their own frame, regardless of the source's motion. So if the light is emitted from a moving source, the observer would still measure c, not something else.

Wait, but that's for light in a vacuum. Wait, but here the light is in a medium. So in the medium's frame, the speed is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to realize that the speed of light in the medium is always c/n relative to the medium, and the medium's velocity is v relative to the lab. So the lab would measure the speed as (c/n) + v, but that can't be correct because that would exceed c if v is large enough.

But wait, in reality, velocities don't just add linearly when approaching the speed of light. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So let's say in the medium's frame, the light's velocity is u' = c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab measures u as (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but the problem is about the light beam propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the medium's velocity.

So substituting u' = c/n and v is the medium's velocity. Wait, but in which direction is v relative to the lab? The medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So in the lab frame, the light's direction is the same as the medium's motion.

So applying the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²))

Plugging u' = c/n:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c )

So the denominator is (n c + v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ) ]

The n's cancel:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v ) 

Hmm, wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Let's see if any of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

But wait, in my expression, I have [ (c +n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

But if c is taken as 1 (as per the problem statement, c=1), then the expression simplifies.

So with c=1, numerator becomes (1 + n v) * 1 = 1 +n v.

Denominator becomes n *1 + v = n + v.

So the expression becomes (1 +n v) / (n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. The velocity addition formula gives the speed as (1 + n v)/(n + v), but that's not the same as the speed of light in the medium. Because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed could be higher or lower.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but according to the velocity addition, the observer would measure the speed as (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but let me check the units. Both numerator and denominator have units of (length/time), since v is in m/s (assuming SI units). So if n is unitless and v is in terms of c=1, this should be correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, another approach: think of it as the glass moving towards the observer. So for light moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity (towards the observer), the observed speed would be higher than c/n, because the medium is approaching the observer.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, that's what we get. So the option A would be correct.

So looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches our derivation.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). The speed of light in a medium is given by \( c/n \) relative to the medium, where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since the problem specifies \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the glass relative to the medium is \( 1/n \).

To find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' = 1/n \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the medium.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab frame.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Now, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions. For example:
- Option **B** (\( 1 \)) incorrectly assumes the speed of light is always \( c \), ignoring the medium's motion.
- Options **C** and **D** involve incorrect signs or denominators, which do not match the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
