Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread that. Oh, wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else? Or is it (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i? Hmm, the wording says "can be described as: ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where i is the square root of -1." So the wave function is complex, with a real part and an imaginary part.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually written as ψ(x) = something. Oh, but in this case, the wave function has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5i). But wait, the imaginary unit is i, so the expression would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i, but that doesn't look like a standard form. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but that's not what's written here. Hmm, perhaps the wave function is written as a complex number where real and imaginary parts are given.

But wait, the key point is that when measuring the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, meaning that the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because that's a complex constant, not a function that depends on x. Oh wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but as written, it's a specific function.

Wait a second, maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) times e^{-i (something)}, but the problem states it as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) -0.5i. That would be a complex number where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, but that would mean that the wave function is a constant in the x direction because the real part depends on x but the imaginary part doesn't. That doesn't make much sense because usually the wave function has both real and imaginary parts varying with x, especially if it's a traveling or standing wave.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the expression. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but that's not what the question says. Alternatively, perhaps it's a summation or a different form. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i, but that would mean the real part is a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But this would make the wave function's imaginary part a constant, which is a bit odd. I'm not sure, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) multiplied by some exponential term. Alternatively, maybe the given wave function is a real function because when you square it, the imaginary parts might cancel or something.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the problem is asking. The question says that when the position is measured, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the probability of finding the particle outside this range is zero. That means the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would imply that the wave function is non-zero for all x where 1+x is positive, which is x > -1. But according to the problem, the only possible x values are between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region, which suggests that it's a piecewise function. But the given expression doesn't look like a piecewise function.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and the given expression is valid only in that interval. But in that case, the wave function must be normalized so that the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1. Because the total probability must be 1.

Wait, but if the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1. So let's compute that.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute |ψ(x)|^2. The modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is (a^2 + b^2). So |ψ(x)|^2 would be (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), so a²/(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|^2 = [a²/(1 + x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but that's not correct because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 +x)) - i*(0.5). So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i).

Then, |ψ(x)|² is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a + ib)^2 is a² + b² when multiplied by the conjugate. So yes, |ψ(x)|^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the modulus squared is a sum of two terms, each dependent on x. But that would complicate the integral.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, then the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

But wait, that would suggest that the wave function is non-zero only in that interval, which is what the problem states. So the normalization condition is ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let me set up the equation:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²/(1 + x)) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

So, let's compute each part separately.

First, the integral of a²/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So that part becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), and ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2). Wait, no. Let me compute:

At x=3: 1+x =4, so ln(4).
At x=1:1+x=2, so ln(2).
So difference is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) )= ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) )= 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Thus, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.721.

So a²≈0.721 → a≈sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - i*(0.5).

2. The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

3. The integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

4. Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² ln(2), as calculated.

5. Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.5.

6. So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849 → ~0.85.

So yes, option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

This is a complex wave function with a real part \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\) and an imaginary part \(-0.5\). The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The problem states that particles are only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), meaning the wave function is zero outside this range. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \([1, 3]\) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

We split this into two integrals:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1 + x}\) is \(\ln(1 + x)\). Evaluating from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over \([1, 3]\) is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to **option B**.
