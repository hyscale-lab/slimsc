Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. I remember that for a state vector, the normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components equals 1.

So, let's write down the state. Let me denote |up> as the first basis vector, say |0>, and |down> as the second, |1>. Then, the state |alpha> can be written as:

|alpha> = (1+i)|0> + (2 - i)|1>

But it's proportional to this, so we'll need to find the normalization factor. The normalization factor N is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2).

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So for 1 + i, that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Correct.

For 2 - i, the absolute value squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So adding these together: 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor N is 1/sqrt(7).

Therefore, the normalized state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |0> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |1>

Now, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, so the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write this out. Since it's for spin-½ particles, the space is two-dimensional. The matrix elements A_ij are:

A_{11} = 0 (since i=j=1, same for A_{22}).
A_{12} = A_{21} = hbar/2.
So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So this operator is actually (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, perhaps? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, if you multiply by hbar/2, you get A.

So, what are the eigenstates of A? Well, since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenstates are the same as those of X, but scaled by the factor.

The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1. So for operator A, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), i.e., ±hbar/2.

The eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The standard eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me confirm. The Pauli X matrix, when applied to |+x>, gives +|+x>, right.

So, to find the probability of measuring the system in each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these states and find the coefficients.

Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for |−x>.

So, I'll express |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me denote |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

Then, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So, first, I'll write |+x> and |−x> in terms of |0> and |1>:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me write |alpha> from the normalized state:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |0> + (2 - i)|1> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, substituting |0> and |1> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the components of |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis. So, the inner product < +x | alpha > would give c_+, and similarly < −x | alpha > gives c_-.

So, compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is ( <0| + <1| ) / sqrt(2)

So, c_+ = [ ( <0| + <1| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|0> + (2 - i)|1> ] / sqrt(7)

Multiply this out:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Because <0|0> is 1, <0|1> is 0, <1|0> is 0, and <1|1> is 1. So when you expand, you get (1+i) + (2 -i), all multiplied by 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Simplify numerator: (1+i +2 -i) = 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -x | alpha >.

< -x | is ( <0| − <1| ) / sqrt(2)

So,

c_- = [ ( <0| − <1| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|0> + (2 - i)|1> ] / sqrt(7)

Expanding:

c_- = [ (1+i) − (2 - i) ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Simplify numerator: (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i).

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286, which is approximately 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

Compute |c_-|²: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] * [ (-1 -2i)/sqrt(14) ) ] = [ (1 + 2i)(-1 -2i) ] / 14.

Wait, no, more accurately, the product is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4 )/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, wait, hold on: |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So for (-1 +2i), the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1+4=5. So |c_-|² =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357, but 9+5=14, so 14/14=1, which is correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 (≈0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36). Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → Average value is hbar/7. Let's see.

Wait, but I also need to compute the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, and |alpha> is a state, perhaps we can compute <sigma_x> and multiply by hbar/2.

Alternatively, compute it directly.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2, and the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2, the average would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * hbar/2 ].

Which is (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * hbar/2 = (1/7) hbar.

So <A> = hbar /7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the first two probabilities would be 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7

Which matches. So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the normalization factor \( N \), where:
\[
N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}}.
\]
The absolute squares are:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]
Thus, \( N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2+5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( X \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis
To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), compute the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) via:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle, \quad c_- = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using \( \langle +x| = \frac{\langle\uparrow| + \langle\downarrow|}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( \langle -x| = \frac{\langle\uparrow| - \langle\downarrow|}{\sqrt{2}} \), we calculate:
\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle\alpha|A|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Since \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) with probabilities \( P(+x) \) and \( P(-x) \), the average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9-5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
