Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but I'll think it through.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, both stars are similar to the Sun in mass, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of their host stars. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. The formula I think is related to the velocity of the star, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital distance. 

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )^(something). Hmm, maybe I should think of a simpler version. Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(something). But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's (Neptune is much less than the Sun), that term can be approximated. So K is approximately proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(a * sqrt(1-e²)) )) but wait, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Wait, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. So K simplifies a bit.

Moreover, for circular orbits, e=0, so the (1 - e²)^0.5 term becomes 1. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) ) * [4π²]^(1/3) ) ) * [1/( (a)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P and the mass of the planet. Another approach is to use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/(a))^(1/ something) ?

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1 + M_p/M_*)^(-2/3) ) / ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) ]

But perhaps a better approach is to relate K, the semi-amplitude, to the orbital period and other parameters.

Wait, another formula I recall is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * c) )

Where c is the speed of light. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think about the relationship between the semi-amplitude shifts and the orbital periods.

The problem gives two shifts: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 a 7 milliangstrom. Since both stars are similar (same mass as the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the main variables would be their orbital distances or periods.

Wait, but the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (sin i, but if both are similar, maybe we can ignore that for this problem), and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the key is that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² G(M_* + M_p)) / (a³), but again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it's approximately P² = (4π² G M_*) / a³.

So a³ = (4π² G M_*) / P².

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(c)) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the following formula for K:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) )) )

But given that e is zero (since the orbits are circular), and M_p << M_*, so 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so K ≈ ( G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) * 2^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think about the proportionality. Since K is the velocity of the star, which is linked to the planet's orbital period.

From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), given that for a circular orbit, it's simplified.

Wait, another approach: because both stars have the same mass, and both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), the ratio of their K velocities depends on their orbital periods.

So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Let me think. From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) ), because other factors (sin i) are the same (assuming both have the same inclination, which isn't stated, but perhaps we can assume that since the shifts are given). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), that ratio is (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, because K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me define it properly. Let me say K ∝ v, which is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Let me write this as:

K1 / K2 = [ (P2 / P1 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We can rearrange for P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

( K1/K2 )^3 = (P2/P1 )

So, P2 = ( K1 / K2 )^3 * P1

Wait, no. Wait, if K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ), then cubing both sides gives (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

But what are K1 and K2? K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet #1, which is 5 milliangstrom, and K2 is 7.

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (K1/K2) =5/7.

So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1.

Wait, that would mean that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is compared to P1. So that would be P2 / P1 = approximately 0.364, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second, does the semi-amplitude K depend on the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the orbital period? Because the star's velocity (K) is related to the planet's orbital speed.

Alternatively, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/(a)) ), but from Kepler's law, a^3 is proportional to P^2, so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So K is proportional to 1/(a) = 1/( P^(2/3) ). So K is inversely proportional to P^(2/3), not P^(1/3).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive.

The RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (c * (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

But let's think about it in terms of Kepler's third law.

From Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_* )

So a³ = G M_* P²/(4 π² )

So a = [ G M_* P²/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

The orbital velocity of the planet is v = 2π a / P.

But the star's velocity is the same as the planet's, because the center of mass is stationary. So K is the star's velocity, which is (M_p / M_*) * v_planet.

Wait, actually, the star's velocity is v_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) ) * v_planet.

But since M_p << M_*, v_* ≈ (M_p / M_*) ) * v_planet.

And v_planet = 2π a / P.

So v_* = (M_p / M_*) ) * (2π a / P )

Substituting a from Kepler's law:

a = [ G M_* P²/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

v_* = (M_p / M_*) ) * (2 π / P ) * [ G M_* P²/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute [ G M_* P²/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

That's equal to [ G M_* ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So,

v_* = (M_p / M_*) ) * (2 π / P ) * [ G M_* ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify this expression.

Let me group the terms:

= (M_p / M_*) ) * [ 2 π / P ] * [ (G M_*)^(1/3) ) ] * [ P^(2/3) ] / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Let me factor out the terms:

The term involving P is [1/P] * P^(2/3) ) = P^(-1 + 2/3) ) = P^(-1/3)

The term involving M_* is [ (G M_*)^(1/3) ) ].

The constants:

2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Let me compute the constants:

Let me compute (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3) ) * (π² )^(1/3 )

So,

2 π / [4^(1/3) * π^(2/3) ) ]

= 2 * π^(1) / [ 4^(1/3) * π^(2/3) ) ]

= 2 / 4^(1/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3 )

= 2 / 4^(1/3) ) * π^(1/3 )

But 4^(1/3) is (2^2)^(1/3) ) = 2^(2/3).

So,

= 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) * π^(1/3 )

= 2^(1 - 2/3) ) * π^(1/3 )

= 2^(1/3) ) * π^(1/3 )

= (2 π )^(1/3 )

So putting it all together, the expression for v_* (which is K) becomes:

v_* = (M_p / M_*) ) * (G M_* )^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3) ) * (2 π )^(1/3 )

= (M_p / M_* ) * ( G M_* )^(1/3 ) * (2 π )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Factor out M_*, 

= M_p / M_* * [ G M_* ]^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 ) * (2 π )^(1/3 )

We can write [ G M_* ]^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3 )

So,

= M_p * G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3 ) / ( M_* ) ) * (2 π )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Simplify M_* terms: M_*^(1/3 ) / M_* = 1/ M_*^(2/3 )

So,

= M_p G^(1/3) / M_*^(2/3) ) * (2 π )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

K = [ (G M_p ) / ( c ) ) ]^(1/3 ) * (2 π )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 ) ) * [ 1 / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, but this seems a bit involved. Let me instead consider the proportionality.

Assuming that M_p and M_* are the same for both cases (as per the question), then K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So, K ∝ 1/ P^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Let me think: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = k * (1/P1)^(1/3 ), K2 = k * (1/P2)^(1/3 ), where k is the proportionality constant.

So K1/K2 = ( (1/P1) / (1/P2) )^(1/3 ) ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2 )^3.

Wait, no. Wait, K1 = k / P1^(1/3 ), K2 = k / P2^(1/3 ).

So, K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

→ (K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1 → P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

Wait, no: Let me write it again.

K1 = k * P1^(-1/3 )

K2 = k * P2^(-1/3 )

Dividing K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = [ P2 / P1 ]^(1/3 )

→ (K1/K2 )^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2 )^3.

Wait, no, (K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1 → P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So, (5/7 )^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1.

Which means that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1?

That is, P2 is 0.364 * P1 → so (P2 / P1 ) = 0.364.

Thus, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, the question is how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, that would be less than 1. So the ratio is 0.36 times, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2 is shorter.

So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A. So the correct option would be A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both stars have the same mass (similar to the Sun), and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, with circular orbits.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises from the fact that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the orbital period. For circular orbits, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Cubing this ratio gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Since \( \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), it follows that:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of approximately 0.36.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.36 \), planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
