Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So, I think this is about electric potential energy between charges. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, it's a Coulomb's law problem. But wait, how do I calculate the potential energy of a system of charges?

I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's formula: U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, in this case, we have multiple charges. So, how do I compute the total potential energy for all the pairs?

Oh, right! The total potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, for n charges, each pair is considered once. So for N charges, the number of pairs is N choose 2, which is N*(N-1)/2.

Wait, but in this problem, there are two different groups: 12 charges at 2 meters from P, and one fixed at P. Let me visualize this. Point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Hmm, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. I'm assuming that their positions form a sphere around P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. But wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P and perhaps arranged in a way that their mutual distances are same? Or maybe the mutual distances are negligible, but that can't be right. No, the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to make an assumption here.

Wait, no, thinking again. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are all 2 meters away from P. But how are they arranged? If it's a sphere, each charge is at a point on the surface. But the mutual distances between the 12 charges would vary. However, considering that all 12 charges are at the same distance from P, but their exact arrangement isn't given, maybe the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges can be calculated based on their average distance or perhaps that the system is such that these mutual distances don't contribute because they're not moving or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem. The 12 charges are each at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at 2m from the 13th, but their mutual distances aren't given. But the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when the 12 charges are arranged in a configuration where their mutual repulsion is minimized. But wait, since they're all positive charges (each is 2e), they repel each other. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the system's potential energy? Or wait, no, because potential energy between like charges is positive, and to minimize the total energy, you need to make the potential energy as low as possible. But since each pair contributes a positive amount, the minimum would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th one, and not considering their mutual interactions. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, the problem says "isolated system," so the potential energy would be the sum of all pairwise potentials. But if the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, perhaps their mutual distances are all 2m as well. No, that's not possible because if all 12 are 2m from P, they can't all be 2m from each other unless they're all at the same point, which would make the potential energy higher, not lower. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the charges are arranged in a regular fashion on a sphere, such that the distance between any two is larger than 2m, but the problem doesn't give that information. So maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not their mutual interactions. Let me think about that.

If that's the case, then the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Since each of the 12 is at 2m from P, each pair contributes U_i = k*(q1*q2)/r. Here, q1 is the charge at P (2e) and q2 is each of the 12 charges (2e). So each U_i would be k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, but let me make sure. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the 13th is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2m. So the total would be 12 times that.

Wait a second, but each pair is counted once. So the 12 charges each contribute a pair with the 13th, so total 12 pairs. So that would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking only for the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between the 12 themselves. But without knowing the mutual distances of the 12, how can we calculate that part? Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't consider the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Let me think. The problem says "the minimum energy of this system," so perhaps it's the potential energy due to all the interactions, but without knowing the mutual distances, maybe it's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would make the potential energy higher, not lower. No, that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, but without any specific arrangement given, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the other 12, and not their mutual interactions. Because if that's the case, then the mutual interactions would contribute a positive amount, and the total potential energy would be higher. But the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, but without considering the mutual repulsion, perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible because then the system would have higher potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are such that their potential energies sum to a certain amount, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore them and only consider the 13th charge and the 12 others.

Wait, let me read the question again: "What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" So the system's energy is the sum of all the potential energies.

So to get the total potential energy, we have to account for all pairs of charges. So the 13th charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 others. And each of the 12 others interacts with each other as well.

So, the total U would be the sum of U between the 13th and each of the 12, plus the sum of U between each pair of the 12.

But without knowing the distances between the 12, perhaps we can't calculate that part. Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual distance between any two is 2m as well. But that's not correct because if you have multiple points on a sphere, their mutual distances are longer than the radius. Alternatively, if all 12 are at 2m from P and the mutual distance between any two is 2m, that would require all of them to be at the same point, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that all are at 2m from each other as well. But that's not possible unless all 12 are on the same point, which would make the potential energy higher. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not their mutual interactions. Because without that information, the problem can't be solved. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

Let me proceed under that assumption.

So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th is U_i = k*(q1*q2)/r.

q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2m.

So U_i = k*(2e * 2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = k*(2e²)/m.

Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * U_i = 12 * (k*(2e²)/2m) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So for each of the 12, U_i = 2k e²/m.

So total for 12: 12 * (2k e²/m) )= 24 k e²/m.

Wait, wait, that's not right. Because the formula is U = k q1 q2 /r. So for each pair, it's (k)*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k *4e²/(2m) = 2 k e²/m.

So each of the 12 pairs (each 12 charges with the 13th) contributes 2k e²/m. So 12 * 2 = 24 k e²/m.

But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since the problem doesn't give their mutual distances, perhaps the assumption is that this part is zero, which doesn't make sense because they are all the same charge and would repel each other, so their mutual potential energy would be positive, contributing to the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all fixed at the same point, but then their mutual distance is zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't the case. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions and only consider the interaction between the 13th and each of the 12.

I think that's the only way to proceed here because otherwise, without knowing the arrangement, we can't calculate the mutual potential energies.

So, moving forward with that, the total potential energy U is 12 * (k * (2e)^2 )/(2m) = 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) = 12 * 2k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Each U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2m) = 2 k e²/m.

So 12 * U_i = 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

So that's 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but m is the distance, which is 2 meters. So r = 2 m. So substituting r=2, that becomes:

U = 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Wait, that's a big simplification. So U = 12 k e².

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. So each of the 12 pairs (charge at P and each of the 12) contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = k*4e²/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

But 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so substituting m=2:

24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Wait, so U = 12 k e².

Wait, but that's the calculation if we ignore the mutual potential energies of the 12 charges. But since all of them are 2e, their mutual contributions would be positive, making the total U higher. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would presumably be when the potential energy is as low as possible. But since all charges are positive, the only way to minimize the potential energy is to have the charges as far apart as possible. So if the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible from each other, their mutual potential energies would be as small as possible (since U is positive, making the total as small as possible). But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is expecting that these mutual contributions are zero, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are negligible, but that's unlikely given the problem statement. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that all the 12 charges are at the same point, so their mutual distances are zero, leading to infinite potential energy. But that can't be right because the minimum energy would be when the system is in the most stable configuration.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation as if the mutual interactions are zero, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point as the 13th, but that would make the potential energy between them zero, which also doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the potential energy contributions. Let's think again. The total potential energy is the sum of all pairs.

Total U = U_13th_with_each_12 + U_between_12_charges.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't calculate the U_between_12_charges. So perhaps the problem is only considering the first part, U_13th_with_each_12.

But that's strange because the mutual potential energies would definitely contribute. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that the potential energy between them is zero. But that's only possible if some are positive and some negative, but in this case, all are same sign (2e). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point as P, but then their mutual distance is zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't the case.

Hmm, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others. So let's proceed under that assumption.

Thus, U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 )/(2m) ) = 12 * k *4e²/(2m) = 12 * 2 k e²/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so substituting:

U = 12 * 2 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Wait, that's 12 k e².

Now, let's compute this numerically.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602×10^-19 C.

So substituting:

U =12 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, compute e²:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

Now, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiplying: 8.988 *2.566 ≈ let's compute that:

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.536.

So total approx 20.528 + 2.536 = 23.064.

So 23.064 x 10^(9-38) )= 23.064e-29 = 2.3064e-28.

Now, multiply by 12:

12 * 2.3064e-28 = ?

12 * 2.3064 = 27.6768.

So 27.6768e-28 = 2.76768e-27.

Wait, but wait, wait. Earlier I thought U was 12 k e², but wait: let me recheck.

Wait, U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 )/(2m).

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². Then, the denominator is 2m. So:

U =12 * (k *4 e²) / (2m) ) =12 * (2 k e²)/(m).

Ah, right. So substituting m=2 meters:

U=12 * (2 k e²) / 2 )= 12 k e².

Wait, so (2 k e²)/(2) is k e², so 12 * (k e²).

Wait, no. Wait, in the denominator it's 2m, so when m=2, denominator is 4.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, no, wait the denominator is 2m, which is 2 * 2m =4 meters? No, m is 2, so 2m is 2*2=4 meters. So:

U = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 * 2) ) ]

Which becomes 12 * [ (4 k e²) / 4 ] = 12 * (k e²).

So 12 k e².

Ah, okay, so that's the correct expression.

So now, compute 12 * k * e².

k is 8.988e9.

e² is (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 1e-38.

Multiplying the two:

8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23.064.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 =1e-29.

So 23.064e-29 = 2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 12:

12 * 2.3064e-28 = 27.6768e-28 = 2.76768e-27 J.

Wait, that gives 2.76768e-27 J. Looking at the options:

Option B is 2.822e-26. Hmm, that's about 10 times higher. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the 13th charge. So each U_i is k * (2e)*(2e)/(2). So each U_i is (4 k e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 12 U_i would be 24 k e².

But wait, no. Because the denominator is 2 (m=2), so each U_i is (4 k e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Ah! That's where I went wrong earlier. So earlier I thought U was 12 k e², but it should be 24 k e².

So let's recalculate:

U = 24 * k * e².

Compute that:

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So k*e²=8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute this.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23.064.

Exponent: 1e9 * 1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.064e-29 =2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 24:

24 * 2.3064e-28 = (24 *2.3064) e-28.

24 *2.3064: Let's compute 20*2.3064=46.128; 4*2.3064=9.2256. Sum: 46.128 +9.2256=55.3536.

So 55.3536e-28 = 5.53536e-27 J.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher than this. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair is counted once. Wait, no, in this case, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, and each interaction is a unique pair. So 12 pairs, each contributing 2 k e².

Wait, but 24 k e² is 24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2).

Wait, perhaps I should recompute that more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

Calculating e²:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C (exact value).

e squared: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x 1e-38.

1.602176634 squared is approximately (1.602)^2 = 2.566, but more accurately:

1.602176634 * 1.602176634:

Let me compute 1.602176634 * 1.602176634:

We can compute 1.602 *1.602 = 2.566 approximately. But let's do it more accurately.

1.602176634 *1.602176634:

= (1.6 + 0.002176634)^2

= 1.6^2 + 2*1.6 *0.002176634 + (0.002176634)^2

= 2.56 + 0.0069652288 + approx 0.000004736.

So approximately 2.56 + 0.006965 = 2.566965, plus 0.000004736 is about 2.56697.

So e² ≈2.56697e-38 C².

Now, compute k * e²:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

k * e²=8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Multiply 8.988 *2.56697:

Let me compute:

8 *2.56697 = 20.53576.

0.988 *2.56697 ≈ approx 2.533 (since 1 *2.56697=2.56697, so 0.988 is approx 2.56697 *0.988 ≈ 2.533).

Adding to 20.53576: 20.53576 +2.533 ≈ 23.06876.

So 23.06876e(9-38) = 23.06876e-29 = 2.306876e-28.

Now, multiply by 24:

24 *2.306876e-28 = (24 *2.306876) e-28.

24 *2 =48. 24 *0.306876=approx 7.365.

So 48+7.365=55.365.

So 55.365e-28 =5.5365e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is B) 2.822e-26, which is about 0.2822e-25. Hmm, but 5.5365e-27 is about 5.5365e-27, which is 0.55365e-26. Not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Perhaps the potential energy is calculated as a sum of all pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves.

But I thought the mutual distances were unknown, but perhaps I can model them as being at the same distance from each other as from P. But that doesn't make sense because if all 12 are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, their mutual distance would be larger than 2m.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but without knowing the exact distance, I can't compute their mutual potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, but that's impossible because you can't have more than a few points all 2m apart on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual potential energy cancels out, but I don't see how that's possible with all positive charges.

Hmm. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. So the total U is 24 k e², which we calculated as approximately 5.5365e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times higher than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the problem.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

In this case, there are 12 charges, each of 2e, at r=2m from the 13th charge (2e). So each pair contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) )= 2 k e²/m.

So for 12 charges, U_total = 12 * (2 k e²/m) )= 24 k e²/m.

But m is 2 meters, so U_total=24 k e²/(2) =12 k e².

Wait, now I'm getting a different result. Because m=2, so 24 k e² / 2 =12 k e².

Wait, no, wait, if m=2, then:

U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(4) )= k e².

So each U_i is k e².

So for 12 charges, U_total=12 k e².

Wait, that's a lower value than before. Let me compute this.

12 * k * e² =12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculating e² again: 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12: 12 *2.306e-28=2.767e-27 J.

Which is about 2.767e-27 J, which is option C is 7.056e-27. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recompute.

Each U_i is (k * q1 q2 ) / r.

q1 =2e, q2=2e, r=2m.

So U_i = k * (2e)(2e)/(2m) )= (4 k e² )/(2m) )= 2 k e²/m.

But m=2, so 2/(2) =1, so U_i= k e².

So for 12 such interactions, U_total=12 *k e².

Which is 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) x 1e(11-38) )= 2.767 x 1e-27 =2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.767e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the distances are in meters, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check: 2 meters is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem considers each of the 12 charges to interact with the 13th, and also each pair of the 12 charges interacts with each other. But then, without knowing their mutual distances, we can't calculate it. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 charges and the 13th, but not their mutual interactions. But given that, the correct calculation is 2.767e-27 J.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times lower than our result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, so 2e * 2e =4 e², and that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the potential energy formula. Wait, the formula for the potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum over all pairs. So for N charges, each interacting with the 13th, the number of pairs is N, which is 12. But wait, no, in this scenario, the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 interacts with it. So 12 pairs. But the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges would be C(12,2) pairs, each at some distance r. But without knowing r, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore them.

So I think the correct approach is to sum only the 12 pairs between the 13th and each of the 12.

So the calculation is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) ) = 12*(4 k e²)/(4) )= 12 k e².

Wait, that's 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute 12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 107.856e9 *2.566e-38 = (107.856 *2.566) x 1e(9-38) )= 276.7 x 1e-29 =2.767e-27 J.

So the total U is approximately 2.767e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 again.

Breaking it down:

k =8.988e9 =8.988 x1e9.

e=1.602e-19.

e squared: 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) x1e(9-38) )= 23.064 x1e-29 =2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3064e-28 *12=27.6768e-28 =2.76768e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So the total U is approximately 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Our calculation is 2.768e-27 J, which is closest to option C (7.056e-27), but it's roughly 2.56 times lower than option C. Hmm, that's a problem. Perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value.

Wait, wait, the charges are 2e each. So the product is (2e)(2e) =4e². So in the calculation, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So for 12 charges, U=12 * 2 k e²/m.

m is 2 meters, so U=12 *2 k e² /2 =12 k e².

Which is 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

As before, that's 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 12 *2.306e-28 =2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 in the exponent. Let me recheck the exponents.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 8.988e9 is 8.988 x1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 x1e-38.

Multiplying gives 8.988*2.566=23.064, and 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.064e-29 =2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 12: 27.6768e-28=2.76768e-27.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing a key factor.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is roughly 2.55 times our result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Maybe the formula is (k q^2 )/(r), but for each pair, it's indeed that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as fixed, so the potential energy is only due to the 13th charge moving into that configuration. Or perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all the charges, including the 13th, so total 13 charges, and the potential energy is calculated as (number of pairs) × (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, number of pairs where the 13th is involved is 12, as before. But the number of pairs among the 12 charges is C(12,2)=66 pairs.

If each of those 66 pairs contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(d), where d is the average distance between the 12 charges. But without knowing d, perhaps the problem is assuming that d is the same as 2m, which isn't correct, but let's try.

Assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that the distance between any two is 2m (which isn't possible, but for calculation's sake), then each of the 66 pairs would contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = same as each pair with the 13th charge.

So U_total = U_13th + U_12pairs.

U_13th = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (4 k e²)/(2m) )=24 k e²/(2m) =12 k e².

U_12pairs =66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=66*(4 k e²)/(2m) )=66*(2 k e²/m).

With m=2m, 2/m=1/m.

Wait, but m=2, so 2/(2)=1.

So U_12pairs=66 *2 k e² /2 =66 *k e².

So total U =12 k e² +66 k e²=78 k e².

Compute that:78 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

78 *8.988e9=702.744e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 702.744e9 *2.566e-38 = (702.744 *2.566) x 1e(9-38) )= 1804.9 x1e-29=1.8049e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.8e-26 J, which is closest to option B (2.822e-26). But it's about 0.6 times that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are smaller, making the potential energy higher.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't proceed accurately. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges and only consider their interaction with the 13th. So the correct calculation is 2.767e-27 J, which isn't among the options. Wait, looking again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher than our result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of Coulomb's constant. Let me confirm: Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². But sometimes, it's approximated as 9e9 for simplicity. Let me try using k=9e9 N·m²/C².

So recalculating:

U =12 * (9e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 9e9 *2.566e-38= 23.094e-29=2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 12: 27.7128e-28=2.77128e-27 J.

Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy is negative? No, because all charges are positive, so the potential energy is positive.

Wait, perhaps I misread the charge value. The problem says each charge is 2e. So q=2e.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (k q1 q2 )/(r), but considering that each pair is counted once, but I think I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the 13th charge. So for 13 charges, the number of pairs is C(13,2)=78. But the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are at 2m from it. So the potential energy would be sum of all pairs:

- 12 pairs between the 13th and each of the 12.

- 66 pairs between the 12 themselves.

Assuming that the 12 are all at 2m from each other, which is impossible, but let's proceed.

So each of the 78 pairs contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So U_total=78 * (4 k e²)/(2m) )=78 * 2 k e²/(2) )=78 k e².

Because 2m=4, so denominator is 4? Wait, no, each pair is at 2m.

Wait, no, the 12 charges are at 2m from the 13th, but their mutual distance is 2m as well. So for each of the 66 mutual pairs, r=2m.

Thus, each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )= (4 k e²)/(2m)=2 k e²/m.

So total U=78 * 2 k e²/(2) =78 k e².

Because 2/(2m) is 1/m.

Wait, no: 2e*2e=4e², r=2m.

So each pair contributes (4 k e²)/(2m) =2 k e²/m.

Total U=78 * (2 k e²/m )= 156 k e²/m.

But m=2, so 156 k e²/(2) =78 k e².

Again, 78 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

78 *8.988e9 =702.744e9.

702.744e9 *2.566e-38 = 702.744 *2.566 = approx 1805. So 1805e-29 =1.805e-26 J.

Hmm, this is approximately 1.805e-26 J. The closest option is B)2.822e-26.

But it's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are larger than 2m, so their potential energy is smaller, but without knowing the exact distance, I can't compute it.

Given the confusion, and since the problem asks for the minimum energy, perhaps the intended approach is to only consider the 13th charge and the 12 others, thus arriving at U=12 * k e² = 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =2.767e-27 J, which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck:

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

k=8.988e9.

So k * e² =8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.306e-28 *12=2.767e-27 J.

Yes, correct.

So the correct answer isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (k * sum(q_i q_j )) / r for each pair.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the 13th charge in the field of the 12 others. But since the 12 others are fixed, the potential energy would be the work done to bring the 13th charge from infinity to P, which would be the sum of each individual contribution.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential at P due to that charge is V =k*(2e)/(2m). So the potential energy of the 13th charge (2e) is U= q * V = 2e * V.

Wait, no, the potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V_i =k*(2e)/(2m) =k e/m.

So the total potential at P is V_total=12 * (k e/m).

Then, the potential energy of the 13th charge (2e) is U= q * V_total =2e *12 * (k e/m) )=24 k e²/m.

Which is 24 k e²/(2) =12 k e².

Which is same as before: 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =2.767e-27 J.

So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is approximately 2.55 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute e²:

e=1.602176634e-19.

e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56696985e-38 C².

k=8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So 8.9875517879e9 *2.56696985e-38 = ?

Compute 8.9875517879e9 =8.9875517879 x1e9.

Multiply by 2.56696985e-38:

8.9875517879 *2.56696985 ≈ let me compute:

8 *2.56696985=20.5357588.

0.9875517879 *2.56696985 ≈ approx 2.533.

Total ≈23.0687588.

So 23.0687588e-29 =2.30687588e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.30687588e-28 *12=2.768251056e-27 J.

Approximately 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

None of these match 2.768e-27 exactly. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, wait, let me compute 8.9875517879e9 *2.56696985e-38.

8.9875517879e9 =8.9875517879 x1e9.

2.56696985e-38=2.56696985 x1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.98755 *2.56697 ≈23.0687.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 23.0687e-29 =2.30687e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.30687e-28 *12=2.76824e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2 )/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) )= 2 k e²/m.

So for 12 charges, U=12 *2 k e²/m =24 k e²/m.

m=2, so U=24 k e²/(2) =12 k e².

Which is same as earlier.

Hmm, but according to the options, this isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but my calculation doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the charges at 0.2 meters instead of 2 meters. LetOkay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't think I need to worry about kinetic energy contributions from movement. 

Wait, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges can be calculated by considering each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since all the particles are identical and have charge 2e, each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge here is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup is that 12 charges are at a fixed distance (2m) from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, surrounded by 12 others. Wait, but how are these 12 arranged? Are they in a symmetrical arrangement, like on a sphere around point P? I think for the purpose of calculating potential energy, the arrangement might not matter because each charge's contribution to the potential can be considered individually.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th is. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P.

But wait, the potential energy of the system includes the energy due to all the interactions between each pair of charges. So I have to consider the potential energy between each of the 12 moving charges and the 13th fixed charge, as well as the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the 12 charges free to move? The problem says they are "constrained" to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they can't move closer or farther. But since they're identical and each is at 2 m, maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but maybe for the calculation, the arrangement doesn't matter because each pair among the 12 is equidistant from each other? Or maybe not, because in a symmetrical arrangement, the distance between any two charges would be the same. However, perhaps the question is simplifying the scenario by assuming that the 12 charges are so arranged that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not given. If that's the case, then the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves is not considered because the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So I think I'm supposed to only consider the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 surrounding it, since the other interactions (between the 12) would be fixed as well, but perhaps the problem wants only the energy between the 13th and the others.

Wait, but wait, no, because the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would vary. For example, if you have 12 charges arranged on a sphere around P, each at 2 meters, then the distance between any two adjacent charges would be less than 4 meters (since the sphere's circumference is 2π*2 = 4π meters, so each charge is spaced along the circumference). But perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual interactions between the 12 are negligible or that the question is only considering the energy due to the central charge and the others. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem states: 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P; the 13th is fixed at P. So these 12 are at 2 meters from the 13th. But their mutual distances are not specified, so perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, but not between the 12 themselves. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are considered point charges fixed in space, so their potential energy with each other is a part of the total energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy, which suggests that all possible interactions are contributing. So I probably need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges in the system. So that's:

- The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 others.
- The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait, how many pairs are there in the 12 charges? For n charges, the number of unique pairs is n*(n-1)/2. So for 12 charges, that's (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

So I need to compute the potential energy for each of these pairs.

But wait, I don't know the distance between any two of the 12 charges. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing how they're arranged, I can't compute their mutual distances. So perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual distances are all the same, but that would only be the case if they're arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other, which is impossible for 12 charges on a sphere. So maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that the mutual potential energy between the 12 can be neglected, or that the system's potential energy is dominated by the central charge interactions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the 13th and the others.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's an isolated system. So the potential energy would include all interactions. So I need to find a way to include all the possible pairs.

Hmm. Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me try to think of it another way. The total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So each pair contributes U = k * q1 q2 / r, where r is the distance between them.

In this system, we have the 13th charge (let's call it q0) at point P, and 12 charges (q1 to q12) each at a distance of 2 m from P. So for each of the 12 charges, the distance from q0 is 2 m.

So the potential energy between q0 and each qi is U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m). Since there are 12 such charges, the total energy from q0 and the others is 12 * U_i.

Now, what about the energy between the 12 charges themselves? Each pair among the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy. But without knowing the distance between any two charges, I can't compute their individual contributions. Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are so arranged that the distance between any two is much larger than 2 meters, making their mutual potential energy negligible. But that's a big assumption and not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12. I think that's a possibility, especially since the question is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps implying the minimal contribution, which would be just the central charge interactions.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in that case, the mutual potential energy between the 12 would be a large positive value, increasing the system's energy. But if the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the system's configuration is such that the mutual potential energies are as low as possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, but that's not possible unless they're arranged in a regular polygon around point P. Let me think: perhaps the 12 are equally spaced on a circle with radius 2 m. Then the distance between adjacent charges would be 2 * 2 * sin(π/12), since for a regular dodecagon, the chord length is 2r sin(π/n), where n is the number of sides. So for n=12, each side is 2 * 2 * sin(π/12) ≈ 2 * 2 * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 meters. Hmm, but that's a small distance compared to 2 meters, so the potential energy between adjacent charges would be significant. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute the exact energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is trying to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, perhaps assuming that it's negligible compared to the central charge's contribution. Or perhaps the problem is simply considering only the potential between each of the 12 and the central charge, and that's all. I think that might be the case, especially since the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances aren't mentioned. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is being neglected.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy, so maybe the system's potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged in a certain way. But without knowing more about their arrangement, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the interactions between the 12 and the central charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the potential energy stored in the system when the 12 charges are placed at 2 meters from P. So the energy is the work done to bring each of the 12 charges from infinity to their positions, considering the field created by the other charges. But that would require considering all the interactions, which again brings me back to the problem of needing their mutual distances.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge. Let's proceed under that assumption for now, and see if the answer matches one of the options.

So, let me compute the energy between the central charge and each of the 12.

Each charge has a value of 2e, so q = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

The distance between each of the 12 and the central charge is 2 meters.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (3.2e-19 C) * (3.2e-19 C) / 2 m.

But wait, wait. Wait, the central charge is fixed, so when each of the 12 charges is placed at 2 m, the potential energy is the work done against the electric field of the central charge. But when placing multiple charges, each new charge will also experience the field of the previously placed charges. Hmm, but wait, but the problem says the system is isolated. Hmm, perhaps the way to compute the total potential energy is to compute the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs. So for the central charge (q0) and each of the 12 (q1 to q12), each contributes U0i = k * q0 q1 / r, which is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2. Then, the total for all 12 would be 12 * U0i.

Additionally, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges would be Uij = k * q_i q_j / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But since the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two charges is determined by the angle between them as seen from point P. For example, if they are equally spaced on a circle (like on a ring), the distance between adjacent charges would be less than 4 m.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, considering that it's either negligible or that the problem is only focusing on the contribution from the central charge.

But let me think about the order of magnitude. Each charge is 3.2e-19 C. The distance from the central charge is 2 m. Let me compute the potential energy between each pair involving the central charge.

Compute U0i for one charge:

U0i = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9 N·m²/C²: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = Let's compute that.

8.988e9 * 1e-38 is 8.988e-29, but wait, 10.24e-38 is 1.024e-37.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = (8.988 * 1.024) * 1e(9-37) → 9.219... * 1e-28 ≈ 9.219e-28.

Then divide by 2 meters: 9.219e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.6095e-28 J.

So each U0i is approximately 4.6095e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.6095e-28 = 5.5314e-27 J.

So that's the contribution from the central charge and the 12 others.

Now, what about the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges? Without knowing their mutual distance, it's hard to compute. But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore this term. Let me see the options given.

The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

The value I calculated from the central charge and 12 others is about 5.53e-27 J, which is close to option C's 7.056e-27, but not exactly. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute the calculation more accurately.

Compute (3.2e-19)^2: 3.2^2 is 10.24, so 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by k (8.988e9): 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 * 10.24 = let's compute that.

8 * 10 is 80, 8 * 0.24 is 1.92, 0.988 *10 is 9.88, 0.988 *0.24 is ~0.237. So adding up:

8*10.24 = 82. 8 *10.24 is 81.92? Wait, no, 10.24 *8 is 81.92, yes.

But 8.988 *10.24 = ?

Let me compute this accurately:

10.24 * 8 = 81.92

10.24 * 0.988 = ?

Compute 10 * 0.988 = 9.88, 0.24 *0.988= 0.23712. So 9.88 + 0.23712=10.11712.

So total 81.92 + 10.11712 = 92.03712.

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = 92.03712e(9-38) = 92.03712e-29 = 9.203712e-28.

Then divide by 2 meters: 9.203712e-28 /2 = 4.601856e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.601856e-28 = 55.22227e-28 = 5.522227e-27 J.

Hmm, so about 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times higher. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about ten times higher.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential energy between the 12 charges. Let me think again.

Wait a minute, the problem states that the system is isolated. So, the potential energy is calculated with all pairs. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs.

Each pair is either a pair involving the central charge, or a pair among the 12.

So, for the central charge: each of the 12 charges contributes a U0i, so 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Wait, but I think I may have made a mistake here. Let me re-express the charge correctly.

Each charge is 2e, so q = 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

So the potential energy between q0 and qi is U0i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) = k*(4e^2)/(2m) = (k * 4e^2)/(2 m) = (2k e^2)/m.

Wait, but wait, no, no, because the distance is 2 m, so 2 meters. So, the formula is U0i = k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (k *4 e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

Wait, no, wait: r is 2 m, so U0i = k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Wait, no, wait, 2e times 2e is 4 e², and 4e² divided by 2 (distance) is 2 e².

So U0i for each charge is 2 e² k.

Since there are 12 of them, the total is 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but that's just the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12. But that doesn't account for the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering this part. Let me compute this value.

So, e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 * e² * k = 24 * 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9.

Compute 24 * 2.56e-38: 24 * 2.56 = 61.44 → 6.144e1 → 6.144e1 *1e-38 = 6.144e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 6.144e-37 *8.988e9 = (6.144 *8.988) * 1e(9-37) → 6.144 * 8.988 is approximately 55.2.

Wait, 6 * 8.988 is about 53.928, and 0.144 *8.988 ≈1.295 → total ≈55.223.

So 55.223e-28 → 5.5223e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as before. But then, where does the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges come in?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual energies. Because otherwise, without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute their contributions.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. If the system's energy depends on the mutual distances of the 12 charges, perhaps the minimum occurs when these mutual distances are as large as possible, making their potential energy as small as possible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy between two charges can be positive or negative, depending on their signs. Since all charges are positive (each is 2e), the mutual potential energy between any two of them is positive. So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of all U0i (which is positive) plus the sum of all Uij (which are positive).

So, if the mutual potential energies are positive, their contribution increases the total energy, making it higher. So, the minimum energy would be achieved when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would happen when the mutual distances are as large as possible. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the U0i terms and not the Uij terms.

But why? Because the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which suggests that their positions relative to P are fixed, but their positions relative to each other are not. Therefore, perhaps their mutual potential energies are part of the system's energy.

Wait, but without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute their mutual potential energies. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered, but the problem is simplifying by assuming that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from each other as well. But that's impossible unless they're in a straight line, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that each is 2 meters from the central charge, and the mutual distances are 2 meters as well. But that's not possible because if you have 12 charges equally spaced on a sphere, their mutual distances are not the same as the radius. For example, in a regular tetrahedron, each charge is at the same distance from each other, but with 12, it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed on a circle of radius 2 m, so each is at 2 m from P, and the distance between two adjacent charges is 2 * 2 * sin(π/12) ≈ 1.035 m, as I thought earlier.

But then, the potential energy between two adjacent charges would be U = k*(2e)^2 / (1.035 m), which would be much larger than the U0i terms.

Wait, but let's compute that. Let me see:

q = 2e = 3.2e-19 C.

r_ij = 1.035 m.

U_ij = k * (3.2e-19)^2 / 1.035.

Compute that:

(3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U_ij = (8.988e9 * 10.24e-38) / 1.035.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 92.037e-29 = 9.2037e-28 J.

Divide by 1.035: 9.2037e-28 / 1.035 ≈ 8.886e-28 J per adjacent pair.

But there are 12 charges arranged in a circle, so the number of adjacent pairs is 12. But wait, in a circle, each adjacent pair is counted once, so 12 pairs.

Wait, no, in a circle, each charge has two neighbors, but each pair is counted once, so for 12 charges, there are 12 adjacent pairs.

So the total mutual potential energy contribution from adjacent pairs would be 12 * 8.886e-28 ≈ 1.066e-26 J.

But wait, that's just the adjacent pairs. There are more distant pairs as well. For example, in a dodecagon, the next nearest neighbors are two steps away, and so on. But their distances are longer, so their potential energies would be smaller than the adjacent ones.

But this is getting complicated, and without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute the exact potential energy. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution, and not the mutual ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be calculated based on an average distance. But I don't see a way to proceed without more information.

Wait, but looking back at the options I have, the value I calculated from the central charge and the 12 others is about 5.52e-27 J, which is close to option C: 7.056e-27, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges is 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/(2 m).

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e², so:

U0 = 12 * (k *4 e²) / (2 m) = 12 * 2 k e² / m.

Wait, no: because the denominator is 2 m, so 4 e² / 2 m = 2 e² / m.

So, U0 = 12 * (k * 2 e²) / m.

Wait, wait, let's compute that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recast the problem.

Each charge is 2e, so the potential energy between each qi and q0 is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r, where r is 2 m.

So U = (k *4 e²) / (2) = (2 k e²).

So for each of the 12, it's 2 k e².

So for 12 charges, the total is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, compute 24 k e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute this step by step.

First, 24 *8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 = 215.712 → 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then multiply by 2.56e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.56) * 1e(11-38) → 5.522e-27 J.

So that's 5.522e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. So none of the options exactly match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, are the charges 2e each? Yes.

Wait, but in the potential energy formula, it's q1 * q2, so for each pair, it's (2e)*(2e) =4e². So that's correct.

So the U0i is (k *4e²)/2 = 2 k e². So 12 * 2 k e² is 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy between each pair is counted once. So for the 13th charge and each of the 12, each pair is counted once. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

So the total energy from the central charge is 5.52e-27 J.

But then, the mutual potential energies between the 12 would add to this.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual potential energies, perhaps because the question is only considering the energy due to the central charge. But in that case, the answer would be 5.52e-27 J, but looking at the options, none matches exactly.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 → 5.645e-26
B) 2.822 x 10^-26 → 2.822e-26
C) 7.056 x 10^-27 → 7.056e-27
D) 122.330 → 122.330 J.

Wait, but 5.52e-27 is much closer to option C (7.056e-27) than to option B or A. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C → e²= 2.56e-38 C².

So 24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9 → 2.15712e11.

Multiply by e² (2.56e-38):

2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.56) * 1e(11-38) → 5.522e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But none of the options exactly match this value. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher than my calculation.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think: the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is 12 pairs, each contributing 2 k e².

Wait, wait, no, U0i = k*(2e)^2/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (1/2) * 12 * 2 k e². Because when you consider each pair once, the central charge is counted once for each of the 12, but perhaps the formula is written differently.

Wait, no, because the central charge is fixed, and the 12 are placed around it. So each of the 12 has a potential energy of 2 k e². So the sum is 24 k e².

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the potential energy. Let me think again. The formula for the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs:

U = (1/2) * sum_{i < j} (k q_i q_j / r_ij )

Wait, but that's because each pair is counted once. So for the central charge and the 12, each is a pair, but in this approach, I have 12 pairs, each contributing U0i.

Wait, but in the approach where you sum for all i < j, the central charge is q0, and the others are q1 to q12. So the pairs are (q0, q1), (q0, q2), ..., (q0, q12). That's 12 pairs, each contributing U0i. Then, the other pairs are (q1, q2), (q1, q3), etc., which are 66 pairs.

So if the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the mutual ones, then the mutual energy must be calculated. But without their distances, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contributions, and the mutual ones are negligible or zero. But why would the mutual ones be zero? They can't be, unless the charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are at infinity, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters from each other as well. But that's impossible unless they are all at the same point, which is not allowed because they are constrained to 2 m from P.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual energies. In that case, the energy would be 5.52e-27 J, which doesn't match any option exactly.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 24 * k * e² more accurately.

Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 = 24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = ?

2.15712 * 2.56 = let's compute:

2 * 2.56 = 5.12.

0.15712 *2.56 = approx 0.403.

So total ≈5.523.

So 5.523e-27 J.

Hmm, no, that's what I had before.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that each of the 12 charges contributes energy. Because the potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the field from the other charges. So when bringing the first charge, it's only affected by the central charge. When bringing the second, it's affected by the central charge and the first charge, and so on.

But in that case, the calculation would be more involved. Let me think about that.

The total potential energy would be the sum of the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position.

But wait, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so perhaps they are brought there one by one, each time accounting for the field created by the previous charges.

Wait, but the central charge is fixed, so when placing the first of the 12, the potential at 2 m is due only to the central charge. The potential energy of the first charge is U1 = q * V, where V is the potential at 2 m due to the central charge.

V = k q0 / r = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So U1 = (2e) * (k e / 2) )= e² k.

Wait no: wait, the potential energy when bringing charge q from infinity to a point where the potential is V is U = q V.

So for the first charge, V is due to the central charge: V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So U1 = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

Wait, no, because q is 2e, and V is k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So U1 = q * V = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

But wait, no. The potential V at point P (where the 12 are placed) due to the central charge is V = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

So the work done to bring the first charge (2e) to that point is U1 = q * V = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

But wait, that's not correct. Because the potential is in volts (J/C), so when you move a charge q through a potential difference V, the work done is W = q V.

So yes, U1 = 2e * (k e) = 2 k e².

Now, when bringing the second charge, the potential at the location is not just due to the central charge, but also due to the first charge that's already there.

So V2 = V_central + V_first.

V_central is (k * 2e)/2 = k e.

V_first is (k * 2e)/r, where r is the distance between the first and second charge.

But wait, without knowing the exact positions of the 12 charges, I can't know r. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energies are negligible, which would be the case if the charges are very far apart, but in this case, they're all at 2 m from the center, so their mutual distances are less than 4 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, which would make the calculation easier. In that case, each charge is only interacting with the central charge. So the potential energy for each is 2 k e², and there are 12, so total is 24 k e².

Which gives 5.52e-27 J as before.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (7.056e-27), which is about 28% higher than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12. Let me compute each step again.

Compute U0i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

So:

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

2e = 3.2e-19 C.

So U0i = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = 92.037e-29 = 9.2037e-28 J.

Divide by 2 m: 4.60185e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 55.2222e-28 = 5.5222e-27 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also (12 choose 2) * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Wait, 12 choose 2 is 66 pairs. So each Uij would be (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij). But without knowing r_ij, I can't proceed, unless the problem is assuming that r_ij is 2 m, which would be incorrect because the charges are on a sphere of radius 2 m, so their mutual distances are less than 4 m.

But if I proceed under the assumption that r_ij is 2 m, then each mutual pair would contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = 2 k e².

So for 66 pairs, the mutual energy would be 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

Wait, but that would be 132 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, 132 * 8.988e9 = let's compute that.

100 *8.988e9 =8.988e11; 30 *8.988e9 = 2.6964e11; 2 *8.988e9=1.7976e10. Total: 8.988e11 + 2.6964e11 = 1.16844e12 + 1.7976e10 = 1.186416e12.

Multiply by e² = (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

So 1.186416e12 * 2.56e-38 = (1.186416 *2.56) * 1e(12-38) → 3.025e-26 J.

So the mutual energy would be approximately 3.025e-26 J.

Adding this to the central charge's contribution of 5.522e-27 J, the total would be approximately 3.577e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26 and option B is 2.822e-26, which are higher than this.

Wait, but this is under the assumption that r_ij is 2 m, which is incorrect because the mutual distances are less than 2 m. So the actual mutual potential energy would be higher than this, as r_ij is smaller, which would make Uij larger (since U is inversely proportional to r).

But without knowing the exact distances, I can't proceed. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution.

But then, the calculated value is 5.522e-27 J, which isn't an option. The closest option is C:7.056e-27, which is roughly 28% higher.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the central charge's potential energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. Some textbooks use k = 9e9 for simplicity. Let me compute with k=9e9.

Compute U0i = 9e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

(3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

9e9 *10.24e-38 =92.16e-29 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.296e-28 =5.5296e-27 J.

Still, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering that each of the 12 charges contributes 2 k e².

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the potential at the location of each charge due to the central charge, and then compute the work done to bring each charge there. But again, the mutual interactions complicate this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, but using a different value for the distance.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, where the 13th is fixed. So the distance r is 2 m.

Each charge is 2e.

So the potential energy for each is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) = [4 k e²]/2 = 2 k e².

So for 12 charges, it's 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute that again.

24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

So 2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 =5.522e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option C:7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (k * (2e)^2)/(2 m) multiplied by 12, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise values.

Let me compute k =8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

Compute e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.566969934e-38 C².

So 24 *k * e² =24 *8.9875517879e9 *2.566969934e-38.

Compute 8.9875517879e9 *2.566969934e-38:

8.9875517879e9 =8.9875517879 *1e9.

2.566969934e-38 =2.566969934 *1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.9875517879 *2.566969934 = approx 23.03 (exact calculation needed).

Wait, let me compute 8.98755 *2.56697.

Compute 8 *2.56697=20.53576.

0.98755*2.56697 ≈ approx 0.98755 *2.5 =2.468875, and 0.98755*0.06697≈0.0663 → total≈2.535175.

Total: 20.53576 +2.535175=23.070935.

So 8.98755e9 *2.56697e-38 =23.070935e(9-38) =23.070935e-29 =2.3070935e-28.

Now multiply by 24:24 *2.3070935e-28 =55.370244e-28 =5.5370244e-27 J.

Still, same as before.

But none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the central charge's contribution, which would make the answer 5.537e-27 J, but the closest option is option C:7.056e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the mutual ones, assuming that each pair of the 12 is at 2 m apart. But that's not possible because 12 charges on a sphere can't all be 2 m apart. So maybe the problem is making a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the potential energy per unit charge, but I can't see that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion. Let me re-check the calculation.

Wait, 24 *k *e².

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.6e-19 C.

So 24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

Multiply by e squared: e²=2.56e-38 C².

So 215.712e9 *2.56e-38 = (215.712 *2.56) *1e(9-38) → 552.222 *1e-29 =5.52222e-27 J.

Hmm. Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to ask about the potential energy per charge, but it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the answer in eV, but the options are in joules.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as the sum of all pairs, considering that each pair is counted once, and the mutual distances are all 2 m. If I proceed under that assumption, even though it's incorrect, let's see what happens.

So each mutual pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2) = 2 k e².

There are (12 choose 2) =66 pairs.

So mutual energy is 66 *2 k e² =132 k e².

Compute 132 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

132 *8.988e9 =1.186416e12.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 1.186416e12 *2.56e-38 =3.025e-26 J.

Adding this to the central charge's contribution of 5.52e-27 J, total energy is 3.577e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.58e-26 J. The options are A:5.645e-26, B:2.822e-26.

Hmm, 3.58e-26 is between options A and B, closer to B.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the mutual energy accurately. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual potential energies and consider only the central charge's contribution, which would be 5.52e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, but using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the sum of all the potential energies of each charge in the potential created by all the others.

For the central charge, it's fixed, so it doesn't contribute to the potential. Each of the 12 charges is placed in the potential created by the central charge and the other 11 charges.

But again, without knowing the mutual distances, I can't proceed.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem expects me to consider only the central charge's contribution.

In that case, the energy would be 5.52e-27 J, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the system's potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential energy in the field of the others. So each charge's potential energy is the sum of the potentials from all other charges.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are at a very large distance from each other, making their mutual potential energies negligible. But in that case, their mutual distances would be much larger than 2 m, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the calculations I have done.

The calculated value from the central charge is approximately 5.52e-27 J. The options given are:

A)5.645e-26 → 56.45e-27

B)2.822e-26 →28.22e-27

C)7.056e-27 →7.056e-27

D)122.330 → much larger.

So option C is 7.056e-27, which is roughly 28% higher than my calculated 5.52e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me think: 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge. So 12 pairs. Each contributing U0i = 2 k e².

So total is 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Wait, but perhaps the potential energy between each pair is (k q1 q2)/r, so for 12 pairs, it's 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2 m) ).

Wait, but wait, (2e)^2=4e², so:

U0 = 12 * (k *4e²)/(2 m) ) =12 * 2 k e² / m? No, wait: 4e²/(2m) = 2e²/m.

Wait no, the denominator is 2 m, so 4e² / (2 m) )= 2 e²/m.

So U0 = 12 * (2 e²/m) *k.

Wait, no, the formula is U0i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4 e² k)/2 = 2 e² k.

So for 12 charges, U0 =12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Which is what I computed earlier.

So I think my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, the closest is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of electron volts (eV) to see if that helps.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.52e-27 J is (5.52e-27) / (1.602e-19) )= approx 3.446e-8 eV.

But that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again for any possible error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 *k *e². Let me compute it again.

k=8.988e9.

e²= (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9=215.712e9.

215.712e9 *2.56e-38=?

215.712e9 =2.15712e11.

2.15712e11 *2.56e-38= (2.15712 *2.56) *1e(11-38) =5.522e-27 J.

Yes, same result.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are placed around it, but the potential energy is computed as the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges in the field of the others.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute this, so perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution.

Therefore, I'll conclude that the correct answer is approximately 5.52e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (1/2) * 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m), which would be 6 * (k*(4e²))/(2) )=6 * 2 k e²=12 k e².

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38=12 *2.297e-28=2.756e-27 J, which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly.

But wait, if I compute 12 k e²:

12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9.

Multiply by 2.56e-38:107.856e9 *2.56e-38=2.757e-27 J.

Which is 2.757e-27 J, close to option C's 7.056e-27, but not matching.

Hmm. I'm really confused now. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation and select the closest option, which is option C, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \(2e\), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \(P\). The total potential energy of the system is determined by summing the contributions from all pairs of charges. However, the mutual distances between the 12 charges are not explicitly provided, making it challenging to compute their mutual potential energy contributions. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - Each charge has a magnitude of \(q = 2e = 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\).
   - The distance between the central charge and each of the 12 charges is \(r = 2 \, \text{m}\).
   - The potential energy between the central charge (\(q_0\)) and one of the 12 charges (\(q_i\)) is:
     \[
     U_{0i} = k \frac{q_0 q_i}{r} = \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
   - For 12 charges, the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{0} = 12 \cdot U_{0i} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
     \]
   - Substituting \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\) and \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\):
     \[
     e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
     \]
     \[
     U_{0} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.56 \times 10^{-38}) = 5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The mutual potential energy depends on the distances between the 12 charges. Without explicit information about their arrangement, the distances cannot be determined. Assuming the 12 charges are symmetrically placed on a sphere of radius \(2 \, \text{m}\), the mutual distances would vary, and their contributions would depend on the specific arrangement. However, the problem does not provide sufficient details to compute these terms accurately.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - The calculated energy from the central charge and the 12 charges is approximately \(5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\).
   - Among the given options:
     - **Option A (\(5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\))**: This is significantly larger than the calculated value.
     - **Option B (\(2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\))**: Also much larger than the calculated value.
     - **Option C (\(7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\))**: This is the closest to the calculated value of \(5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\), though it is about 28% higher.
     - **Option D (\(122.330 \, \text{J}\))**: This is orders of magnitude larger and clearly incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The problem likely assumes that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is negligible or not required for the calculation, focusing only on the energy due to the central charge. Based on the given options, the closest match to the calculated value is **Option C**.
