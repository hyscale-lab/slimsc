Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, right?

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down their concentrations and volumes. So, 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2.

Wait, I think the first step is to find out how many moles of H+ ions and OH- ions are present. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the H+ and OH- combining.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. That's 0.1 moles H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives two H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So the H+ from this would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. OH- ions would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4, and OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Now, which one is the limiting reactant? Because the neutralization will stop when one of them runs out. So comparing H+ and OH-:

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the equivalents. Oh, right, because H+ and OH- combine 1:1.

So the equivalents of H+ are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting, so all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of H+ remaining is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But for the neutralization, the moles that actually react are 0.2 moles. So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of water.

Wait, but wait. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ reacting. So the enthalpy change depends on how many moles of H+ are neutralized.

I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. So if I calculate the moles of H+ that reacted, multiply by that value, I should get the total enthalpy change.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction is between H+ from the acids and OH- from the base. So each mole of H+ reacting with a mole of OH- releases heat, typically around 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ (since OH- is 0.2) would react, releasing 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, some sources say it's 57 kJ per mole of H+ reacting. So 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the numbers.

Wait, the options are A: -2.72 kcal, B: -11.42 kcal, C: -3.80 kcal, D: -16.0 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ would be about 2.72 kcal. Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which would be -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total H+ and OH- available. H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So when they react, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- combine, producing 0.2 moles of water. The excess H+ is 0.08 moles. So the heat released is for 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, that's -11.4 kJ, but wait, the options have -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ in kcal. Since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. Wait, no, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is the same as -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the molar calculations.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So yes, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ will react.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. Each mole releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57= 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Or in kcal, as I did earlier.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ converted into kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total H+ and OH-.

Oh wait, another thing: when H2SO4 is a strong acid, does it release two H+ ions immediately?

Yes, because H2SO4 is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so each mole gives two H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH-.

So the calculations are correct.

Wait, but wait—could there be an issue with the stoichiometry?

Alternatively, perhaps the limiting reagent is the H+ available. Wait, no, because the OH- is 0.2, which is less than the H+ available (0.28). So OH- is limiting.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, which produces 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ released, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72).

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but the question is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total heat released when all the H+ and OH- that can react do so.

So, the total amount of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O. The heat released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. So among the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal. Let me clarify.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, we can convert that to kcal by dividing by 4.184.

11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72. So the enthalpy is approximately -2.72 kcal, which would match option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl:

0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4:

0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2:

0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles that can react are 0.2, as OH- is the limiting.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 = 2.72).

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

So the correct answer would be either A or D, depending on the units.

Wait, the options aren't in the same units. Options A, B, and C are in kcal, D is in kJ.

So the correct answer would be either D (-11.4 kJ) or A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So -2.72 kcal is option A, which is approximately the same as -11.4 kJ.

But wait, wait. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization enthalpy is usually given per mole of H+.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, and each mole releases 57 kJ, the total is 11.4 kJ.

So the answer in kJ would be -11.4 kJ, which isn't exactly an option. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second is weak? No, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, and the second is also strong. So each mole gives two H+.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, in some contexts, the neutralization enthalpy is taken as 57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but that's the same as per mole of H+.

Wait, but let me think again. Each mole of H+ reacts with OH- to form 1 mole of H2O, releasing 57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H2SO4.

Wait, 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L=0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So 0.2 moles H+ and OH- react. So 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. So correct.

So, the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which would be about -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So the answer is A.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation.

Wait, another thought: the neutralization reaction may also involve the formation of BaSO4. Wait, wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and H2SO4 is a strong acid. When they react, the products would be BaSO4 (a precipitate) and water.

Wait a minute! I think I missed this part. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4 and water.

So, the neutralization might not just be about H+ and OH- combining, but also about the acid and base reacting to form a salt.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the neutralization of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would not just produce water but also a salt.

So let's think again.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would proceed as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but actually, each mole of H2SO4 would react with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the neutralization enthalpy includes the heat from the formation of BaSO4.

Hmm, this could change the calculation. Because if the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which usually refers to the reaction of an acid with a base to form water and a salt.

Wait, so the overall reaction would be the sum of the neutralization of HCl with Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles of H+ from each acid and moles of OH- from the base, then find out which is the limiting reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall reaction is better approached by considering all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the problem in a different way.

The problem states that HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So all three are reacting together.

HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base with two OH- per formula unit.

So, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the moles of H+ remaining would be 0.08.

Wait, but the rest of the H+ (0.08 moles) would remain in solution, along with any unreacted Ba(OH)2? Or wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all of it would dissociate, but the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So, the moles of H+ that react are 0.2.

Each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the neutralization of H2SO4 with a base is considered as a two-step process because it's diprotic. But in this case, since the OH- is limiting, all the H+ from H2SO4 and HCl that can react with OH- will do so, regardless of the source.

So, the approach I took earlier is correct.

So, among the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ.

But looking again, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a larger value.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I missed any reactions that release additional heat.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces not just water but also BaSO4, which might have its own enthalpy change. But wait, the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically only the H+ and OH- reacting. The formation of the salt is considered part of the neutralization process, but the enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the H+ and OH- → H2O part. So, maybe I don't need to consider the formation of BaSO4 in this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately, and then summing the enthalpies.

Wait, let's try that approach.

First, the neutralization of HCl with Ba(OH)2.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But HCl is monoprotic, so each mole of HCl reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of H2O.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH-.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, two moles of H+ are neutralized.

So, the reaction would be: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

In this case, moles of HCl: 0.1, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So, the reaction would require 0.1 *2 = 0.2 moles of HCl to react with 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2.

But HCl is 0.1 moles, so that's exactly enough. So all the Ba(OH)2 (0.1 moles) would react with 0.2 moles of HCl, but we only have 0.1 moles of HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent here.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, maybe the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 consumes both H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Reaction 2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O.

But considering the moles available for each reaction.

But this approach might not be correct because all three solutions are mixed together, so the reaction would proceed until all possible H+ and OH- are neutralized.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just stick with the initial approach, considering total H+ and OH-.

So, my initial calculation was that 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the neutralization enthalpy is given as 57 kcal/mol. Because sometimes the value is presented in kcal.

Wait, no, I think the standard value is 57 kJ per mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the answer is A.

Alternatively, option D is -16.0 kJ. Let me see why that might be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes two H+. So in my initial calculation, I considered that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for the heat released when Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4 to form BaSO4, which has a higher enthalpy change.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is specific to the H+ and OH- reacting. The formation of the salt (like BaSO4) would have its own enthalpy of formation, but the problem is specifically about the neutralization reaction, which is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So I think the initial approach is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

   - **Total H⁺ available:**  
     \( 0.1 \, \text{(from HCl)} + 0.18 \, \text{(from H₂SO₄)} = 0.28 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

   - **Total OH⁻ available:**  
     \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which proceeds 1:1.  
   - H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  

   Since OH⁻ is present in smaller quantity, it is the limiting reactant. All \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, consuming \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)).  
   - Moles of H⁺ neutralized = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  

   Converting to kcal:  
   \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Compare with the options:**  
   - **Option A:** \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) (matches the calculated value).  
   - **Option B:** \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) (does not match).  
   - **Option C:** \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) (does not match).  
   - **Option D:** \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) (does not match, as \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) is closer to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Answer: A
