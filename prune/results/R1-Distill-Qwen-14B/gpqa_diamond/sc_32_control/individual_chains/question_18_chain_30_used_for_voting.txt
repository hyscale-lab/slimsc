Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, the question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass: 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here. Or perhaps they set the context about the stars' types, but I'm not sure. I'll keep that in mind.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a technique used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere. The values are in dex, which is log base 10. So [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: So Star_1 has silicon relative to iron higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: Star_2 has magnesium relative to silicon higher than the Sun by 10^0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: Star_1's iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: Star_2's magnesium relative to hydrogen is same as the Sun.

The sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. The formula is 12 + log(n_X / n_H) = value. Oh wait, I remember that the solar abundance is often expressed as 12 + log10(n_X / n_H) = something, where X is the element. So for Fe, it's 7.5. Similarly for Mg, it's 7.

So, let's write that down. For the Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait wait, no. Wait, the formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So solving for log10(nX/nH) is value minus 12.

So for Fe: log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

For Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Now, we need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So ratio n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Wait, but how do I get n_Si for each star?

Well, let me think. The problem gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, and [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are zero.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance is same as the Sun. So nFe,1 / nH,1 = same as Sun, which is 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi,1 / nFe,1 ) = 0.3 → nSi,1 / nFe,1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi,1 = 2 * nFe,1. And since nFe,1 is 3.16e-5, nSi,1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 6.32e-5.

Then, what about nH,1? Since [Fe/H] is zero, nFe,1 = (3.16e-5) * nH,1 / (nH,sun) * (nH,sun) ? Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of solar values.

Wait, perhaps I should express all the abundances in terms of the Sun's. Let me denote:

For Star_1:
nFe,1 = (Fe/H)_1 * nH,1 / (Fe/H)_sun * nH_sun? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the [Fe/H] is log10(nFe / nH) - log10(nFe,sun / nH,sun) = 0.

So log10(nFe,1 / nH,1) = log10(nFe,sun / nH,sun) → nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe,sun / nH,sun.

Which implies that nFe,1 = (nFe,sun / nH,sun) * nH,1.

Similarly, for Star_1, nFe,1 = (3.16e-5) * nH,1 / (nH,sun) * nH,sun? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of the ratio nX/nH in the star as being the same as in the Sun for Fe, because [Fe/H] is 0.

So, for Star_1, nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe,sun / nH,sun → nFe,1 = (nFe,sun / nH,sun) * nH,1.

But since the exact value of nH is not given, perhaps I can work with ratios.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio nSi,1 / nSi,2. So perhaps I can express each nSi in terms of nH for each star, and then take the ratio.

Let me proceed.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi,1 / nFe,1 ) = 0.3 → nSi,1 = 10^0.3 * nFe,1.

But nFe,1 = (nFe,sun / nH,sun) * nH,1.

So nSi,1 = 10^0.3 * (nFe,sun / nH,sun) * nH,1.

Similarly, nH,1 is the hydrogen in Star_1's photosphere.

But without knowing the total hydrogen, perhaps I can find the ratio in terms of nH,1 and nH,2.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the silicon abundance to hydrogen via other elements.

Wait, let's also look at Star_2.

For Star_2:
[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log10(nMg,2 / nH,2) = log10(nMg,sun / nH,sun) → nMg,2 = nMg,sun * (nH,2 / nH,sun).

[ Mg/Si ]_2 = 0.3 → log10( nMg,2 / nSi,2 ) = 0.3 → nMg,2 = 10^0.3 * nSi,2.

So substituting nMg,2 from above: 10^0.3 * nSi,2 = nMg,sun * (nH,2 / nH,sun).

Thus, nSi,2 = (nMg,sun / 10^0.3 ) * (nH,2 / nH,sun).

But wait, nMg,sun is known as 1e-5 (since log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg = 1e-5 * nH ).

So nMg,sun = 1e-5 * nH,sun.

So substituting:

nSi,2 = ( (1e-5 * nH,sun ) / 10^0.3 ) * (nH,2 / nH,sun) )

Simplify that, nH,sun cancels out:

nSi,2 = (1e-5 / 10^0.3 ) * nH,2.

Wait, nH,2 is the hydrogen in Star_2. Similarly, nH,1 is the hydrogen in Star_1.

But how do I relate nH,1 and nH,2?

Hmm. Since the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms, maybe I can find nSi,1 / nSi,2 in terms of nH,1 and nH,2. Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH,1 to nH,2.

Wait a minute, perhaps the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere is the same as the Sun's? No, that doesn't make sense. Because stars can have different compositions, and the hydrogen abundance could vary.

Wait, but the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 =0. Which means that for Star_1, [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is same as the Sun. But what about other elements like H? I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe / nH) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe,sun/nH,sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg,2/nH,2= nMg,sun/nH,sun.

But without knowing more, perhaps I can express nSi,1 and nSi,2 in terms of nH,1 and nH,2, respectively.

Wait, let me go back.

For Star_1:

nSi,1 = 10^0.3 * nFe,1.

But nFe,1 = (nFe,sun /nH,sun) * nH,1. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe,sun/nH,sun.

So nFe,1 = (nFe,sun / nH,sun ) * nH,1.

Substituting into nSi,1:

nSi,1 = 10^0.3 * (nFe,sun / nH,sun ) * nH,1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg,2 = 10^0.3 * nSi,2.

But nMg,2 = (nMg,sun /nH,sun ) * nH,2.

So,

10^0.3 * nSi,2 = (nMg,sun / nH,sun ) * nH,2.

Solving for nSi,2:

nSi,2 = (nMg,sun / (10^0.3 * nH,sun )) ) * nH,2.

Wait, so nSi,1 is proportional to nH,1 and nSi,2 is proportional to nH,2.

But I need to find the ratio nSi,1 / nSi,2. So let's compute that ratio.

nSi,1 / nSi,2 = [10^0.3 * (nFe,sun / nH,sun ) * nH,1 ] / [ (nMg,sun / (10^0.3 * nH,sun )) * nH,2 ].

Simplifying:

= [10^0.3 * (nFe,sun / nH,sun ) * nH,1 ] * [10^0.3 * nH,sun / (nMg,sun ) ) ] / nH,2.

Wait, let me write this again:

nSi,1 / nSi,2 = [ (10^0.3 * nFe,sun / nH,sun * nH,1) ) ] / [ (nMg,sun / (10^0.3 nH,sun) ) * nH,2 ) ]

= (10^0.3 * nFe,sun * nH,1 / (nH,sun) ) ) / (nMg,sun * nH,2 / (10^0.3 nH,sun) ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ (10^0.3 * nFe,sun * nH,1) / nH,sun ] * [ 10^0.3 nH,sun / (nMg,sun * nH,2) ) ]

= (10^(0.3 +0.3) * nFe,sun * nH,1 * nH,sun ) ) / (nH,sun * nMg,sun * nH,2 )

Simplify:

nH,sun cancels in numerator and denominator.

= 10^0.6 * (nFe,sun / nMg,sun) ) * (nH,1 / nH,2 )

Wait, but I don't know nH,1 and nH,2. How can I proceed?

Hmm, perhaps I need to find another relation between nH,1 and nH,2.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't provide any other information. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says "assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances". But LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) probably doesn't directly affect the abundances in this context, as it's about the method.

So perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun? But that can't be right, because that would mean [H] is same, but the problem doesn't give [H] for the stars.

Wait, but looking back, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe,sun/nH,sun → same as Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg,2/nH,2 = nMg,sun/nH,sun.

But what about [H] in the stars? I don't have their [H] values. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the overall H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that's an assumption, and I don't know if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the ratio of nH,1 and nH,2.

Wait, but without knowing that ratio, I can't proceed numerically. So I must have missed something.

Wait, maybe I can relate the H abundance by considering the mass of the stars. The problem gives their masses as 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's. But how does that relate to the abundance?

Wait, actually, the mass of the star might affect the surface gravity, which could influence the line broadening, but in this case, it's about the elemental abundances, not the line profiles.

Hmm, perhaps the mass isn't directly relevant here. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore the H variation and assume that nH is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that would be a big assumption, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be derived from the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, nFe,1 = (nFe,sun /nH,sun ) * nH,1.

But I don't know nH,1.

Similarly, for Star_2, nMg,2 = (nMg,sun /nH,sun ) *nH,2.

So without knowing either nH,1 or nH,2, I can't find the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars cancels out. Let me go back to the ratio expression.

Earlier, I had:

nSi,1/nSi,2 = (10^0.6 * (nFe,sun / nMg,sun )) ) * (nH,1 / nH,2 )

So I need to find (nH,1 / nH,2).

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can relate the H abundance in each star to another element. For Star_1, I have [Fe/H] =0 → Fe abundance is same as the Sun. For Star_2, [Mg/H] =0, same as Sun.

But what about the other elements?

Wait, perhaps the total number of atoms in the photosphere is the same for both stars as in the Sun? Or perhaps not. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so nH,1 =nH,sun and nH,2= nH,sun, which would make the ratio (nH,1/nH,2) =1, and the ratio of silicon would be 10^0.6 * (nFe,sun / nMg,sun).

But wait, nFe,sun is 3.16e-5, nMg,sun is 1e-5.

So (nFe,sun /nMg,sun) = (3.16e-5)/(1e-5) )=3.16.

So 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98 (since 10^0.6= e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(1.381) ≈ 3.98).

So (nFe/nMg) * 10^0.6 ≈ 3.16 *3.98 ≈ 12.56.

Wait, but that would be the case only if nH,1/nH,2 =1. But I'm not certain if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in the two stars is the same as in the Sun, so nH,1 =nH,2 =nH,sun.

But I'm not sure if that's a correct assumption. The problem doesn't specify that the H abundance is the same; it only gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is same as in the Sun. Let's proceed with that assumption to see where it leads.

If nH,1 = nH,2 =nH,sun → then the ratio (nH,1 /nH,2 )=1.

So the ratio becomes:

nSi,1/nSi,2 = 10^0.6 * (nFe,sun / nMg,sun )

Which is 3.98 * (3.16e-5 /1e-5) ) = 3.98 *3.16 ≈ 12.57.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the steps.

nFe,sun is 3.16e-5, nMg,sun is 1e-5. So their ratio is 3.16.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98.

3.98 *3.16 ≈ 12.56.

So the ratio is about 12.6, which is option B.

But wait, why did I assume nH,1 =nH,2? Because the problem doesn't give [H] for the stars, I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH,1 and nH,2 can be found through another element's abundance.

Wait, let's think again. For Star_1:

nFe,1 = (nFe,sun /nH,sun ) *nH,1.

For Star_2:

nMg,2 = (nMg,sun /nH,sun ) *nH,2.

But we don't have any other information about other elements to relate nH,1 and nH,2.

Wait, unless there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the ratio of silicon to something else, but no, it's the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars.

Wait, another way: perhaps I can express the ratio of silicon in terms of the ratio of hydrogen in each star. So, the ratio nSi,1/nSi,2 = (10^0.6 * (nFe/nMg)) ) * (nH,1/nH,2 )

But without knowing anything else, I can't compute (nH,1/nH,2 ). So perhaps the problem assumes that nH is same in each star, which would give the ratio as 12.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the H abundance is same as the Sun, but that's an assumption.

Wait, the problem statement says "using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars". So perhaps the H abundance isn't needed because it's considered as a reference.

Wait, the given data includes [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe relative to H is same as the Sun. So in Star_1, Fe is same as Sun relative to H. Similarly, in Star_2, Mg is same as Sun relative to H.

But I'm not sure if that implies that nH is same as Sun's.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is same in both stars as in the Sun. So nH,1 = nH,2 =nH,sun.

If that's the case, then the ratio (nH,1/nH,2)=1, and the silicon ratio is approximately 12.6, which is option B.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the abundance ratios can be used to find the ratio of silicon without needing H.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si/Fe)=0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈2. So Si = 2 Fe.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg/Si=10^0.3 → Mg=2 Si.

So:

Star_1: Si =2 Fe.

Star_2: Mg=2 Si → Si = Mg /2.

But we know that in the Sun, Mg is 1e-5 nH, Fe is 3.16e-5 nH.

So in Star_2, since [Mg/H]=0, Mg = 1e-5 nH,2.

So in Star_2, Mg=1e-5 nH,2. Then Si = Mg/2 = (1e-5 nH,2 ) /2 =5e-6 nH,2.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → Fe=3.16e-5 nH,1.

So Si=2 Fe =2*(3.16e-5 nH,1 )=6.32e-5 nH,1.

So the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is (6.32e-5 nH,1 ) / (5e-6 nH,2 ) )= (6.32e-5 /5e-6 ) * (nH,1 /nH,2 ) ) → (12.64) * (nH,1 /nH,2 ).

Hmm, so it's 12.64 times (nH,1/nH,2 ), but I still don't know that ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is 1, so the ratio is 12.64, which aligns with option B.

But why would the ratio of H be 1? Because neither [Fe/H] nor [Mg/H] gives info about other elements. So perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, and thus nH,1 =nH,2 =nH,sun.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found by considering that the sum of all element abundances must match, but without knowing all elements, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is same in both stars, and thus the ratio is simply 12.6.

So I'm going to go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si},1} / n_{\text{Fe},1}) = 0.3 \) → \( n_{\text{Si},1} / n_{\text{Fe},1} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Fe},1} / n_{\text{H},1} = n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg},2} / n_{\text{Si},2}) = 0.3 \) → \( n_{\text{Mg},2} / n_{\text{Si},2} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg},2} / n_{\text{H},2} = n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} \).

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) = -4.5 \) → \( n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) = -5 \) → \( n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe},1} / n_{\text{H},1} = n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} \), so \( n_{\text{Fe},1} = (n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot n_{\text{H},1} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si},1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Fe},1} \). Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe},1} \), \( n_{\text{Si},1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot n_{\text{H},1} \).

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg},2} / n_{\text{H},2} = n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot} \), so \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = (n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot n_{\text{H},2} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si},2} \). Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg},2} \), \( n_{\text{Si},2} = (n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / (10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H},\odot})) \cdot n_{\text{H},2} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{H},\odot}) \cdot n_{\text{H},1}}{(n_{\text{Mg},\odot} / (10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H},\odot})) \cdot n_{\text{H},2}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{10^{0.6} \cdot n_{\text{Fe},\odot}}{n_{\text{Mg},\odot}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{H},2}}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the relative hydrogen abundances (\( n_{\text{H},1} / n_{\text{H},2} \)). To proceed, we assume \( n_{\text{H},1} / n_{\text{H},2} = 1 \), meaning the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun.

#### Final Calculation:
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \),
- \( n_{\text{Fe},\odot} / n_{\text{Mg},\odot} = (3.16 \times 10^{-5}) / (10^{-5}) = 3.16 \).

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 3.98 \cdot 3.16 \approx 12.6.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

Answer: B
