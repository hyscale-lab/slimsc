Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, effective temperature is linked to the star's luminosity, right? Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity L is proportional to Teff^4 multiplied by the surface area. But when spots are present, the total luminosity must decrease. But the question here isn't about luminosity; it's about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels.

So the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. Oh wait, right, this probably involves the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_has_spots.

But why does this ratio change? Because when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. Wait, but the star's overall Teff is lower, but the spots themselves are cooler regions. Wait, but the question says that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think the effective temperature refers to the average temperature of the entire photosphere.

Wait, but dark spots on a star are cooler regions. So when spots are present, the average temperature of the entire star's photosphere is lower. So the effective temperature of the star (as seen from afar) is lower when spots are present, but the individual regions (like the spots and the non-spots) have their own temperatures. But wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots, but perhaps the actual spot temperature is even lower than that. Oh, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the star as a whole is being modeled as having an average Teff of 5500 K when 40% of the area is spots.

But for the purpose of this problem, maybe I can treat the photosphere as having a uniform temperature when the spots are present, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but that might not be correct because the spots are cooler and the rest are hotter. Wait, but the problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, then the overall Teff drops. So maybe the star's effective temperature is a weighted average of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature than the surrounding. Let's say the star's normal (unspotted) surface is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, each spot is presumably at a lower temperature, say T_spot. So the effective temperature of the star (which is a measure of the total emitted flux) would be lower. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps it's the average T_eff of the entire photosphere, meaning that the star as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that can't be exactly correct because spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which isn't physically accurate, but for the sake of solving the problem, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Wait, but maybe the problem is not about the star's overall temperature but the temperature of the regions from which we're observing the Ti lines. Hmm, the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the regions contributing to that ratio are at a lower temperature when spots are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present. So the assumption is that the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is the average over the entire surface. So the 6000 K regions cover 60% of the surface, and the spots are T_spot. Let me think about that.

Wait, the effective temperature depends on the fourth root of the total emitted flux. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions. Let me model this. Let the unspotted regions have area A1 and temperature T1, and the spotted regions have area A2 and temperature T2.

The total flux F_total is F1 * A1 + F2 * A2, where F is the flux per unit area. Then, the effective temperature T_eff is such that (sigma * T_eff^4) = F_total.

So, sigma * T_eff^4 = (sigma * T1^4) * (A1 / A_total) + (sigma * T2^4) * (A2 / A_total).

Dividing both sides by sigma,

T_eff^4 = (T1^4) * (A1/A_total) + (T2^4) * (A2/A_total).

In this problem, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, A2 = 0.4 A_total, and A1 = 0.6 A_total. So,

5500^4 = (6000^4) * 0.6 + (T_spot^4) * 0.4.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So that's when A2 = 0. So that makes sense.

But perhaps the problem is making a mistake by considering the overall Teff as 5500 K when the spotted regions are cooler, but for the sake of solving the problem, I think I should proceed as if the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Because the question states that the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases to 5500 K, implying that the entire photosphere is at that temperature.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the way to model this is that when spots are present, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature than the rest. But the problem doesn't provide the temperature of the spotted regions. So maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering that the effective temperature (i.e., the average temperature of the photosphere) is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. So the temperature of the photosphere has decreased, so the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels would change based on the Boltzmann factor.

So the ratio of n1 to n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ). Since E1 and E2 are energies, the difference (E1 - E2) is positive if level 1 is higher than level 2. Let me think about that. Suppose level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 > E1, so E1 - E2 is negative. So the exponent becomes positive, which would make the ratio larger if T is higher. Wait, let me get the exact expression.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i > E_j, then E_i - E_j is positive, so the exponent is negative, so exp(-x) is less than 1. So the ratio would be lower than 1 if E_i is higher than E_j.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is 5500 K. So the temperature is lower.

So let's say when the star has spots, T = T2 = 5500 K, and when it doesn't, T = T1=6000 K.

The ratio R1 (no spots) is (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T1) )

The ratio R2 (spots present) is (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T2) )

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R2 < R1. So the factor is R1/R2 = [exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Simplify this:

Factor = exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k T1) + (E1-E2)/(k T2) ] )

= exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Because ( -(1/T1) + (1/T2) ) = [ (T2 - T1) )/( T1 T2 ) ) ].

Wait, but E1-E2 is the energy difference between the two levels. The problem gives the transition wavelength λ ≈ 1448 Å. So the energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ.

Yes, that's right. The energy difference between the two levels is given by the photon emitted when transitioning from level 2 to level 1, assuming level 2 is higher. So E = hc / λ.

Wait, but wait, if the transition is between level 1 and level 2, which one is higher? The problem says when spots are present, the ratio decreases. Let me think about that.

Let me denote level 1 as the lower level and level 2 as the higher level. So E2 > E1. Then E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Wait, but the ratio is n1 / n2. So according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because (E1 - E2) is negative. So E2 - E1 is positive. So the ratio depends on the temperature.

At higher temperatures, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(k T) will be smaller (since denominator is larger), so the exponent is smaller, so exp(small number) is closer to one. So the ratio (n1/n2) would increase with higher T.

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower (T2=5500 K), so the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So with lower T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp( that ) is larger, so the ratio is larger. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I got the levels reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should define E1 as the higher energy level and E2 as the lower. So E1 > E2. Then the energy difference E1 - E2 = hc/λ.

In that case, the Boltzmann equation becomes (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -( (E1-E2) )/(k T) )

Now, if E1-E2 is positive, then when T increases, the denominator is larger, so the exponent is more negative, so exp( a more negative number ) is smaller. So (n1/n2) would decrease as T increases.

Wait, that makes more sense. Let's think. If the higher energy level has a lower population when T is higher, because thermal energy allows more atoms to be in higher energy levels.

Wait, so let's say level 1 is higher than level 2. Then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

At higher T, the exponent is more negative, so exp(-x) is smaller. So (n1/n2) is smaller at higher T. So when the star is hotter (no spots), (n1/n2) is smaller.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, i.e., when T is lower. So if the star's temperature goes down (from 6000 to 5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) should increase, because T is lower.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I have the energy levels reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n2/n1) is being considered. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if E1 is lower than E2, then the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential is smaller, so (n1/n2) decreases.

So if T increases (no spots, T=6000 K), then (n1/n2) decreases. So when spots are present (T=5500 K), (n1/n2) would be higher. Because T is lower, so (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp(that) is larger, so (n1/n2) is larger.

But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the levels.

Wait, perhaps the ratio being considered is (n2/n1). Let's see: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

If E1 > E2, then (E1-E2) is positive, so (n2/n1) decreases as T increases because the exponent becomes more negative.

So when the star is hotter (no spots), (n2/n1) is lower, meaning (n1/n2) is higher. But the problem states that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should formalize this.

Let me define:

- E1: energy of level 1

- E2: energy of level 2

Suppose E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So the energy difference is positive.

The ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

When T increases:

- (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases (since T is in denominator)

- exp(that) decreases.

So (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.

So when the star's T is higher (no spots, 6000 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller.

When the star's T is lower (spots, 5500 K), (n1/n2) is larger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That contradicts what I just found. So maybe I have to flip the levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would be (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

In that case, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(-x) increases, making (n2/n1) increase. So (n2/n1) is higher when T is higher.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T is lower (spots present), (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp(that) is larger, making (n1/n2) larger. But in the problem, (n1/n2) is smaller when T is lower. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Let me think again.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is lower.

Wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, for E2 > E1:

(n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(that) increases, so (n1/n2) increases.

But the problem says that when T decreases (spots present), (n1/n2) decreases. That's a conflict. So perhaps E1 is higher than E2.

Let me try that: E1 > E2.

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) 

= (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, because E1 - E2 is positive, so it's negative in the exponent. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(that) decreases. So (n1/n2) decreases.

So when the star's T increases (no spots, 6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller.

When T decreases (spots, 5500 K), (n1/n2) is higher.

But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So this is impossible under this model. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as (n2/n1), which would be the inverse of (n1/n2). Let's see:

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so -(E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So exp( -x ) is 1/exp(x), which is smaller than 1.

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(that) increases. So (n2/n1) increases as T increases.

But the problem states that when T decreases (spots present), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2) would be higher when T is lower. So if the observed ratio is lower when T is lower, this can't be explained by E2>E1.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the inverse ratio. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Because when T decreases, (n2/n1) would decrease. Let's see:

If E2 > E1,

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

At higher T, -(E2-E1)/(k T) is a larger negative number, so exp(that) is smaller, so (n2/n1) is smaller. So when T increases, (n2/n1) decreases.

Wait, so when the star is hotter (no spots), (n2/n1) is smaller. When the star is cooler (spots present), (n2/n1) is larger. But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to calculate the ratio when the temperature changes.

I think the key is to calculate the ratio R = (n1/n2) at T1 (6000 K) and T2 (5500 K), and find R1/R2.

But first, I need to find the energy difference E2 - E1.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = let's compute that.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18

1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.373.

So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But we can also express this in terms of eV, since Boltzmann's constant is in eV/K units.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J = (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

So E ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Let me compute 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So 1.373e-25 +7 = 1.373e-18 J. Correct.

So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J, which is about 8.57 eV.

So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV.

Now, using Boltzmann's equation, the ratio R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but I think earlier I might have mixed up E1 and E2. Let me re-define:

If E2 is higher than E1, then E = E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

So R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent (E/(k T)) decreases, so R increases if g1/g2 is greater than 1, or R could either increase or decrease depending on the statistical weights.

But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, i.e., when T decreases. But according to the equation, if E is positive, then R increases when T decreases. So that would mean when T is lower, R is higher. Which contradicts the problem statement.

So perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, with E1 < E2. Wait, that would make E negative, so the exponent becomes negative, leading to R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E)/(k T) ), where E is negative. So for example, E = -8.57 eV.

But that would make the exponent (E)/(k T) negative, so exp(that) is 1/exp( ... ), which is a number less than one.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(that) is smaller, so R decreases.

Which matches the problem statement: when T decreases (spots present), R increases, but the problem says R decreases. Hmm, no.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If E = E1 - E2 = -8.57 eV.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( (-8.57 eV)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, exp(that) is smaller, so R decreases.

Which would mean that when T is higher (no spots), R is lower, and when T is lower (spots present), R is higher.

But the problem says that when spots are present, R decreases. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up in the energy levels. Let me try to approach it differently.

The key point is that when the star's temperature decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, the ratio must be inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if E is positive (E2 > E1), then R = (g1/g2) * exp(E/(k T)).

So R is proportional to exp(E/(k T)), which is larger when T is smaller.

Thus, when T decreases, R increases.

But the problem says that when T decreases, R decreases, which can't happen unless the energy E is negative, i.e., E1 > E2.

So, let's define E = E1 - E2 = 8.57 eV (so E1 is higher than E2).

Then R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( E/(k T) )

Now, when T decreases, E/(k T) increases, so exp( E/(k T) ) increases, making R larger.

But the problem says that R decreases when T decreases, which is a contradiction. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the ratio (n2/n1), which would be 1/(n1/n2). 

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

= (g2/g1) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) is negative, so the exponent is negative.

So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

= (g2/g1) * exp( -E/(k T) )

Because E = E1 - E2.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( -E/(k T) ) increases. So (n2/n1) increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) )

Wait, but I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to compute the ratio R1 and R2.

Given that the transition is at 1448 Å, which corresponds to E = hc/λ.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = let me compute this more accurately.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So E = 8.57 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's equation: R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E)/(k T) )

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T2) ) ] )

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out.

So factor = exp( E/(k T1) - E/(k T2) )

= exp( E/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Now, plug in the numbers.

E = 8.57 eV.

k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K: k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

T1 = 6000 K (no spots), T2 = 5500 K (spots).

Compute [1/T1 - 1/T2] = (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) )

= (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = (-5e2)/(3.3e7) ) = approximately -0.0000151515.

Wait, 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4

So 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -0.1515e-4 ≈ -0.00001515.

So [1/T1 - 1/T2] = -0.00001515.

Now, E/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ Let me compute that.

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ Approximately 100,000 (since 8.6e-5 is 0.000086, 8.57 / 0.000086 ≈ 100,000). Wait, let me compute it accurately.

8.57 / 0.00008617 = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 8.617 * 1e5.

8.57 / 8.617 ≈ 0.994.

So 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 99,400.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

Now, E/(k) * [1/T1 - 1/T2] = 99,400 * (-0.00001515) ≈ Let's compute that.

99,400 * (-0.00001515) = approx -99,400 * 1.515e-5 = -99,400 * 0.00001515.

99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994.

99,400 * 0.00000515 = 99,400 * 5.15e-6 = 99,400 * 5.15e-6 = approx 0.512.

So total is 0.994 + 0.512 = 1.506, but with the negative sign, it's -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

So the factor is exp(-1.506) ≈ e^(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but wait, the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (R2), the ratio decreases. So R1 is higher than R2. So R1/R2 is larger than 1.

Wait, but according to the calculation, R1/R2 is 0.221, which is less than 1. That would mean R1 < R2, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

E/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,400 K.

Yes.

Then, [1/T1 - 1/T2] = (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/33,000,000 ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -5/(3.3e5) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So E/(k) * [1/T1 -1/T2] = 99,400 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 99,400 * (-0.00001515) ≈ 

Let me compute 99,400 * 0.00001515.

99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994

99,400 * 0.00000515 = 99,400 * 5.15e-6 = approx 0.512

So total is 0.994 +0.512 = 1.506, but negative.

So 99,400 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

exp(-1.506) is approximately 0.221.

So R1/R2 = exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221, which implies R1 = 0.221 * R2.

But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1.

But according to this, R1 = 0.221 R2, which would mean R1 < R2, which contradicts the problem statement.

So where did I go wrong?

Ah! Maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let's go back to the Boltzmann equation.

The correct expression for R is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is positive.

So when T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(that) decreases.

Thus, (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.

So R1 (no spots, T=6000 K) is less than R2 (spots, T=5500 K).

But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases, so R2 < R1. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to (n2/n1) instead of (n1/n2). Let's try that.

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

= (g2/g1) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative, so the exponent is negative.

So when T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp(that) becomes smaller, so (n2/n1) decreases.

Which would mean that when the star is hotter, (n2/n1) is lower.

If the problem refers to (n2/n1), then when T decreases (spots present), (n2/n1) increases.

But the problem states that when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should take a different approach.

The main point is to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, when the star has spots, T is lower. The ratio R (n1/n2) is lower when T is lower. So, R1 (no spots) / R2 (spots) is greater than 1.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher, unless the energy E is negative. I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the energy E is negative. Let's say E = E2 - E1 = -8.57 eV. So E2 < E1. Then,

R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( -8.57 eV/(k T) )

Now, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(that) becomes smaller, so R decreases.

Which fits the problem statement: when the star has spots (T lower), R decreases.

Yes! So that's the case. So E2 is lower than E1. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = -8.57 eV.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( (-8.57 eV)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( -8.57/(k T) )

Now, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(that) decreases, so R decreases.

Which matches the problem statement.

So the factor is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -8.57/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -8.57/(k T2) ) ]

= exp( (-8.57/(k T1)) + (8.57/(k T2)) )

= exp( 8.57/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So E = 8.57 eV, k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Compute 8.57/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 99,400 K.

Then, 1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^-1

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667 K^-1

So 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 K^-1.

Thus,

8.57/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99,400 * 0.0000151 ≈ 

Compute 99,400 * 0.0000151:

99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994

99,400 * 0.0000051 = 99,400 * 5.1e-6 = 0.506.

So total is approximately 0.994 + 0.506 = 1.5.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5.

So factor = exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48, which is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The equation is:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{-(E_1 - E_2)}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their statistical weights, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are their energies, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
   \[
   E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Temperatures**:
   - When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - When the star has spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

3. **Ratio Change**: The problem states that the ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) decreases when the star has spots. This implies that \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) is inversely proportional to temperature.

### Calculation of the Ratio Change Factor:
The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{-(E_1 - E_2)}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{-(E_1 - E_2)}{kT_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( E = 8.57 \, \text{eV} \),
- \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \),
- \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \),
- \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{E}{k} \):
\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:
\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,400 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5.
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.5) \approx 4.48.
\]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \). This corresponds to **Option C**.
