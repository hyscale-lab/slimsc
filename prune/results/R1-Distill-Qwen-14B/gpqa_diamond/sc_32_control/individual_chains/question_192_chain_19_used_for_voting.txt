Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, right. I remember that when there's a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh wait, but when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must induce charges to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have an induced charge opposite to the inner one.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is initially neutral. So when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor's material is a conductor, the charges will move to cancel the electric field within the conductor itself. So inside the conducting material, the electric field is zero. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the total charge of the conductor is the sum of inner and outer induced charges. Inner is -q, so outer must be +q to make the total zero.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor should remain zero. Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of all induced charges must be zero. So if the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, how does that work? Oh, wait, no. Oh, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The conductor is neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is a conductor and charges move to cancel the field in the conductor's material. So the inner surface has -q. But since the conductor was neutral overall, the remaining charge must be on the outer surface. So the outer surface must have +q, to balance the inner's -q. Because the conductor's total charge was zero, but the inner has -q, so the outer must have +q, making the total zero. So, the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so it's outside the outer surface of the conductor. So, when calculating the electric field at P, it's as if all the charge of the conductor is concentrated at the center. Because of the shell theorem, the outer shell of charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the point P being outside, the field would be due to the +q charge. But wait, the conductor has an outer radius R, and point P is at a distance L from the center, which is larger than R. So the field at P is due to the outer charge, which is +q, and the field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²). Because the outer conductor's charge is the only thing contributing to the field outside the conductor.

But wait, what about the charge inside the cavity? The charge +q is inside the cavity, but it's inside the conductor. So the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is due to the induced charges on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. Because the inner charge's field is canceled inside the conductor, but outside, the field would be as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the charge +q is inside the cavity. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0, which makes sense because the conductor was neutral. So when we're outside, the conductor's charge is +q on the outer surface, so the field at P is as if it's a point charge +q at the center.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but it's also at a distance l from the cavity's center. But wait, the conductor's center is the same as the cavity's center, right? Because the cavity is inside the conductor. Or wait, no, the problem says the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh, right! So the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The conductor has its center at, say, point O, and the cavity's center is at point O', which is s distance away from O.

Oh, that complicates things. Because the inner and outer induced charges are not symmetrically placed around the conductor's center. Because the cavity is off-center. So the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor must be arranged in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but in a conductor, the charges rearrange themselves to cancel the internal field. So when the cavity is off-center, the induced charges on the inner surface will create an electric field that cancels the field due to the charge q inside the cavity. But because the conductor is a spherical shell (well, the inner surface is a spherical shell, but if the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's induced charge distribution might not be uniform), but wait, no. The problem states that the conductor is a spherical conductor, so the outer surface is a sphere, but the inner surface is a spherical shell as well? Or is the cavity just a spherical hollow not aligned with the center?

Wait, the problem says it's a small spherical cavity inside the conductor, and the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity is not at the center, but the conductor is a sphere. So the inner surface of the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is a smaller sphere inside, not at the center.

Hmm, but how does the induced charge on the inner surface look? I remember that in the case of a charge inside a conducting shell, the inner surface's induced charge is such that the field in the conductor is zero. But when the charge is not at the center, the induced charges on the inner surface would create a field that cancels the field due to the charge inside. So the inner surface will have a charge distribution that depends on the position of the charge q.

Wait, but if the conductor is a sphere, then the inner surface is a sphere. Oh wait, no. The inner surface is just the cavity's wall. So if the cavity is a sphere of radius r, and it's centered at a point s away from the conductor's center, then the inner surface is a sphere of radius R, but shifted. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface is a spherical shell, but the charge distribution isn't uniform because the cavity is off-center.

Wait, but in reality, the conductor will adjust its charges so that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. So the induced charges on the inner surface would be such that they, along with the charge q inside the cavity, produce an electric field that is zero in the conductor. So the induced charge on the inner surface must be -q, but arranged in a way that the field from the charge and the induced charges is zero in the conductor.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so if the charge is off-center, the inner surface's induced charge would not be uniform. But perhaps, for the purposes of the problem, we can model the inner surface's induced charge as if it's a point charge at the same point as the charge q. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and despite the cavity being off-center, the effective charge that contributes to the external field is the same as if the charge were at the center. But I'm not confident about that.

Wait, going back to the problem. The point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So, perhaps the field at P depends on the position of the charge q relative to the conductor's center.

Wait, but since the conductor is a sphere, the outer induced charge is +q, and it's on the outer surface. So the field outside the conductor (like at point P) would be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor, right? Because the outer shell's charges distribute themselves spherically symmetrically, so the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

Wait, but wait. If the conductor is a sphere, and the charge on its outer surface is +q, then yes, the field outside would be that of a point charge at the center. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

But wait, looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's an option. But I'm not sure because the charge inside the cavity is off-center. Does that affect the external field?

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, and the distribution is spherically symmetric. So regardless of the position of the inner charge, the external field would be as if all the charge is at the center. Because the outer shell's field only depends on the total charge and the distance from the center. So the inner displacement doesn't matter for the external field.

Wait, but the conductor is a conductor. So the induced charges on the outer surface would be such that they produce a field that cancels the internal field. But the external field is due to the outer induced charges.

Wait, maybe the outer charges are uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the outer induced charge remains +q and is uniformly distributed, leading to an external field as if it's a point charge at the center.

So, the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². So that would correspond to option B.

Wait, but why are the other options present? Let me look at the other options. Option A is 1/(4πε₀) * q / (l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the conductor's center and the cavity's center. So l - s cosθ would be the distance along the line between the centers, or something like that.

But if the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, and the field at P is only due to that, then perhaps the answer is B. But I'm not entirely certain because the problem states that P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, which is s away from the conductor's center.

Wait a second. Alternatively, maybe the field at point P is due to both the charge inside the cavity and the induced charges on the outer surface of the conductor. But wait, no. The conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, and the inner surface's charge is -q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero. But wait, no, the conductor was neutral. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, so the total is zero.

So, the field outside the conductor is due to the +q on the outer surface. Thus, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the answer should be option B.

But wait, I'm not considering any other effects. Let's think again. Could the charge inside the cavity, being off-center, affect the external field? I think not, because the outer induced charges are symmetric with respect to the conductor's center, so their field depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

But wait, perhaps if the cavity's charge is off-center, the induced charges on the inner surface could influence the field outside. No, because the inner surface's induced charge is -q, but it's inside the conductor, and the conductor's outer surface's induced charge is +q. The field outside is only due to the outer charge, which is +q and spherically symmetric.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and a distance $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's wall) induces a charge $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.  
   - Since the conductor remains neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The point $P$ lies outside the conductor, so the electric field at $P$ is determined by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. By the shell theorem, the charges on the outer surface of a spherical conductor behave as if they are concentrated at the center of the sphere.  
   - The outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, and the electric field at $P$ is therefore given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
     \]  
     where $L$ is the distance from $P$ to the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   - The cavity is off-center, separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. However, the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center. The off-center position of the cavity does not affect the external field because the outer surface charges are distributed spherically symmetrically.

4. **Analysis of the Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This suggests the field depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.  
   - **Option B**: This correctly gives the field as $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, consistent with the calculation above.  
   - **Option C**: This suggests the field depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: This suggests the field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the external field depends on $L$, not $l$.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is solely due to the $+q$ charge on the outer surface of the conductor, and its magnitude is given by $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
