Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After dilution, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, dilution uses the formula C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³, the new volume is 40 cm³. So let's calculate C2.

C2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. Let's find the initial moles of acetic acid. Volume is 40 cm³ (after dilution), concentration 0.025 M.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles.

So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, I need to calculate the pH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction consumes an equal amount of acetic acid. So initial moles of CH3COOH after dilution was 0.001. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume of the solution now is the original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 2.0e-5, pKa around 4.7. But let me compute it accurately.

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

Wait, wait, wait. Since pKa is -log(Ka), so 1.85e-5 → log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)=0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

Then, [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333 (since 0.005882 is 1/16.666 of 0.017647? Wait, 0.005882 is 1/3 of 0.017647? Let me compute 0.017647 / 3 is about 0.005882. So yes, the ratio is 1/3.

Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations. Let me compute the exact ratio. 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. Yes, so the ratio is 1/3. So log(1/3) is indeed approximately -0.477. So pH is about 4.256, which rounds to 4.26.

So at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The volume is the total volume after adding all the NaOH, which is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. So the solution will be basic, and we can calculate pH using the Kb.

First, Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Change: let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x)/(0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb *0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 5 - log(1.04) → log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH ≈4.983.

pH =14 -4.983 ≈9.017. Wait, that's about 9.02, but none of the options have pH near 9 at equivalence. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think. Oh wait, wait a second. The acetate comes from a strong base, so the solution is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, but maybe my calculation is wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. So yes, Kb is correct.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. So using Kb = x²/(0.02), x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11, x=√(1.081e-11)=approx 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98, pH=14-4.98=9.02.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them have pH around 9. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, what if the volume isn't correct? At equivalence, the total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L. So moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact quadratic equation to find x, but since Kb is so small, the approximation holds. So why are the options not showing pH near 9?

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A: 4.26;8.52. Option D: 4.57;6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait a minute, perhaps I confused the way the solution is set up. Wait, when you titrate acetic acid with NaOH, at equivalence, you have sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be higher than 7. But the options don't have equivalence pH higher than 8, except option A (8.52), and option D (6.92 which is less than 7, which can't be right).

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 →5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but when I computed [OH-], I used Kb*x^2= 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. So x=√(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in another part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is wrong. Let me recheck.

Original volume 20 cm³, 0.05 M acetic acid. Then 20 cm³ of water is added, so total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M *0.02 L ) /0.04 L = (0.001 mol) /0.04 L=0.025 M. That's correct.

So the initial moles are 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 mol. So when titrated to equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH is added.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume is 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³. So the calculation was correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the pH at equivalence more accurately.

Wait, let's do it without approximation.

The equation is Kb = x²/(0.02 - x). Let me set up the equation:

x² = Kb*(0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Numbers: Kb=5.405e-10.

So equation: x² +5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10 )=0.

Which simplifies to x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] /2.

Since x is positive, take the positive root.

Compute discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 = (approx) 2.921e-19, and 4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is 43.24e-12. 2.921e-19 is negligible compared to 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Oh! So the pH is approximately 8.52. So at equivalence, pH is around 8.52.

Wait, that's different from my initial approximation. So why did that happen? Because earlier I ignored the x in the denominator (0.02 -x) but it's actually small but not negligible.

Wait, but in reality, x was about 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6. 0.02 is 2e-2, which is much larger, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02 is a good approximation. So why did the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach.

Wait, let's compute the discriminant again.

The discriminant is (a)^2 +4ac.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

Wait, 5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 *1e-20 =29.214e-20=2.9214e-19.

4 *1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So sum is 4.324e-11 + 2.9214e-19 ≈ approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt of that is sqrt(4.324e-11)=approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → 6.576e-6 /2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH=9.02. So why the discrepancy? Because the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 was incorrect. Oh wait, no, because 3.288e-6 is 3.288e-6, which is 0.0003288% of 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So 3.288e-6 is 0.02 - 3.288e-6 ≈ 0.02. So why did the quadratic method change the result? Because even though x is small, the more precise calculation gives a slightly higher x, hence a lower pOH and higher pH than the initial approximation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if [OH-] is lower than the initial approximation, pH would be higher. Wait, no, wait. Wait, [OH-] is higher when x is higher. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait, in my first approximation, I considered [OH-]=1.04e-5, which is about 1.04e-5 M, leading to pOH ~4.98 and pH ~9.02.

But in the quadratic approach, [OH-] is 3.288e-6, which is about 3.29e-6 M, which is less than 1e-5. Wait, that can't be right because the Kb is 5.4e-10. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic calculation.

Wait, let me compute x² = Kb * (0.02 -x).

Wait, let me plug in x=3.288e-6 into the equation.

x² = (3.288e-6)^2 ≈1.081e-11.

Kb*(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10*(0.02 -3.288e-6) ≈5.405e-10*(0.02) → since 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so it's approximately 1.081e-11.

So the equation holds. So x is about 3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

Wait, but that's lower than the initial approximation. Wait, that can't be right because if [OH-] is lower, pH would be higher. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, [OH-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so pOH≈5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517 → approximately 8.52.

Hmm, but earlier, when I used the simple approximation, the [OH-] was 1.04e-5, so pOH=4.98, pH=9.02. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in my initial approach. Let me think again: When I used the simple approximation, I set Kb ≈ x²/0.02 → x^2 = Kb *0.02 → x=√(5.405e-10 *0.02)=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH-] would be 1.04e-5, leading to pH≈9.02.

But the quadratic solution gives [OH-]=3.288e-6, which is lower, leading to pH≈8.52.

Wait, but that's impossible because the solution should be basic, but 8.52 is still basic. However, according to the calculations, the more accurate value is about 8.52.

So, the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is around 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option A is A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but the options also have other possibilities. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52  
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C)4.73;7.00  
D)4.57;6.92

So option A is consistent with our calculations: 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, earlier when I thought the equivalence point was around 9.02, but the correct calculation after quadratic gives 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the equivalence point was 8.52, but in the initial approach using the approximation, I thought it would be 9.02. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me re-express the Kb equation.

Wait, let me write Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M. [CH3COOH] is x, [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x).

Ah, wait, I think I confused the expression earlier. Wait, the correct equation is Kb = x²/(0.02 - x), where x is [OH^-], but we also have [CH3COOH] =x, since each OH^- comes from CH3COO^-.

Wait, but when you have a base like CH3COO^-, the reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

So the Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = Kb.

Let me set x = [OH^-] = [CH3COOH]. So initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x).

So when x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02, leading to x=√(5.405e-10 *0.02)=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But in the quadratic approach, I found x=3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52. That doesn't make sense because 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 1e-5. Wait, no, 3.288e-6 is less than 1e-5. So which is correct?

I think I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me re-solve the equation.

Let me write the equation again: x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² +Kb x -0.02 Kb =0.

Substituting Kb=5.405e-10.

So x² +5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10 )=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Wait, wait, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x + (-1.081e-11)=0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So discriminant is b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11.

So 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.921e-19. So sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2 ≈6.576e-6 /2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Wait, but this contradicts with the initial approximation where x was 1.04e-5.

Wait, this suggests that the initial assumption that x is negligible is not correct, and the quadratic solution is the correct approach.

So the correct [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M, leading to pH=8.52.

But according to the initial approximation, x=1.04e-5, which gives pH=9.02. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, no, the quadratic solution correctly accounts for the change in acetate concentration due to hydrolysis. But wait, in reality, the acetate does not release much OH- because Kb is so small. So the approximation should be acceptable, but it seems the more accurate approach gives a lower pH.

But how can this be? Because the quadratic solution gives a lower x, meaning less OH- and thus a lower pH?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Wait, let me do a sanity check. If I consider the initial approximation where x=1.04e-5, then pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But according to the quadratic, x=3.288e-6, which is much smaller, so pOH would be 5.485 → pH=8.515.

But this would suggest that the solution is less basic than the initial approximation, which doesn't make sense because with Kb=5.4e-10, which is very small, the [OH-] should be small, leading to a pH near but below 9.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms in the quadratic equation. Let me recompute the discriminant.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant is b² - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11)=4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(discriminant)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2) → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

Hmm, so according to this, the pH is about 8.52, which is the value option A suggests for the equivalence point.

But wait, why does the initial approximation give a different result? Because the initial approximation assumes x is negligible compared to 0.02, but in reality, even though x is small, it's contributing enough to make a noticeable difference.

Wait, but in this case, 3.288e-6 is about 0.016% of 0.02 M, so it's a very small fraction. So maybe the initial approximation is good enough, and the pH would be around 9.02.

But according to the more accurate calculation, it's 8.52.

Wait, but that's a significant difference. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact method for weak base calculations.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the pH using the formula:

pH = 0.5*(pKa + pKw - pKb') )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact [OH-].

Let me try to compute x:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11) ] / 2.

As before, the sqrt is approximately 6.576e-6.

So x ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 → 3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6.

Wait, but if I plug this back into Kb:

x²/(0.02 -x) = (3.288e-6)^2/(0.02 -3.288e-6) = (1.081e-11)/(0.0199967) ≈5.407e-10, which matches Kb=5.405e-10.

So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

Thus, the correct option is A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but looking back, the initial moles are 0.001 mol, and I think that's correct.

But wait, another thought: when you dilute, you have 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.02 L *0.05 M=0.001 mol. After adding 20 mL H2O, volume is 40 mL. So concentration is 0.001/0.04=0.025 M, correct.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH:0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH]=0.00075 / 0.0425=0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 / 0.0425=0.005882 M.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) =4.733 + log(0.3333)=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →≈4.26.

So the first part is correct.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the initial concentration \( C_1 = 0.05 \, \text{M} \), \( V_1 = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and \( V_2 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the concentration after dilution is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since 1 mole of NaOH neutralizes 1 mole of acetic acid, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \). The total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x \approx 0.02 \). Thus:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The hydroxide ion concentration is \( [\text{OH}^-] = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]
