Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me some spectral data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a broad peak could also be from an -OH group in an alcohol, maybe an ester, or something else. But the presence of a broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical for hydroxyl groups.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, those are in the range for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe a carbonyl in an ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation, or perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, 1650 might be a C=C stretching, but I'm not sure.

The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. That makes me think maybe an ester with a double bond, or an aromatic ring with substituents, but wait, since it's vinyl, it's more likely an alkene.

Mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think what gives a peak at 45. Common fragments include things like the methyl group (15), but 45 is a bigger fragment. Maybe a ketone group (like (CH3)2CO would have a fragment at 45?), but wait, 45 could be CH2O or something else. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment like (CH3CO) which is 45 (12+16+16=44? Wait, no, 12 for C, 3 H3 is 3, O is 16: 12+3+16=31? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)2O group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)3 group, but that would be 28. Wait, perhaps it's the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that's 91. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ester group. For example, if the compound is something like an ester with a methyl group, like methyl acetate, but wait, the molecular formula is C6, so maybe something else.

Now, the options are:

A) C6H12O2: Possible structures could be esters or cyclic ethers, but given the O2, maybe an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. Also, esters might have carbonyl peaks around 1700-1750. The IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be from the ester's carbonyl and maybe an aromatic ring (but if there's a ring, would that be another peak? Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is another carbonyl, like a conjugated ester or a ketone.

Option B: C6H10O. This would have a degree of unsaturation. Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero, here: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So DoU is 2. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc. But with an O, maybe an alcohol with a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6+2-10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Same as B. So structures could be an ester (RCOOR') which would have O2, and a double bond. Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol, but that would complicate IR.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. If it's an alcohol with a ring, perhaps.

Looking back at the data: FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. Then, two carbonyl peaks. Wait, that would suggest two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, perhaps one carbonyl and an aromatic ring (where the 1650 is C=C aromatic). Hmm.

Wait, the FTIR has two peaks: 1700 and 1650. 1700 is likely a carbonyl (maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, or an aromatic ring with C=C. But if 1650 is a C=O, then we have two of them. But that would require the compound to have two carbonyl groups, which might complicate things.

But wait, another possibility: the 1650 peak could be a C=C stretch, as in an alkene. But in that case, the 1700 would be the carbonyl. So that makes sense. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR supports an alkene. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

So maybe it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Those have conjugated carbonyl and double bonds. So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's see, that would have a structure with an ester group (so O2), a double bond (so vinyl H in NMR), and a carbonyl at 1700. The IR would show a broad peak for the ester's O-H? Wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the broad peak in IR is at 3000. That's more indicative of an O-H stretch, which is present in alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, etc. Esters don't have O-H groups; they have O linked to R groups. So if the compound has a broad peak, perhaps it's an alcohol. But that would introduce another O, making the formula C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

Wait, but wait, the broad peak could also be from an -OH group in another functional group. Let me think again.

If the compound has an -OH group, then the formula must have at least one O. Looking at the options, all have O, either O, O2, etc.

So the presence of a broad peak suggests an -OH group. So the compound is either an alcohol, a phenol, a carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether with some hydrogen bonding. But ethers don't have O-H; they have O-R. So more likely, it's an alcohol or a phenol.

So, if it's an alcohol, the formula would have one O. Let's see the options:

Option B: C6H10O → one O.

Option D: C6H12O → one O.

Option A and C have two Os. So if the compound is an alcohol, the O count is 1. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is from something else. For example, an aldehyde has a strong absorption around 2820 and 2720 (due to the C-H stretch in the aldehyde), but a broad peak at 3000 might not be aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diol or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the broad peak could be from an amine (N-H), but the options don't have N, so probably not. So back to O-H.

So if the compound is an alcohol, the formula would have one O. So the options would be B (C6H10O) or D (C6H12O).

But wait, looking at the IR data, there's a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, so if it's an alcohol but also has a carbonyl, like maybe a ketone. So the structure could be a ketone and an alcohol.

But that would be a ketone and an alcohol in the same molecule. So the formula would have O. Let's see, for example, if it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. Or perhaps a secondary alcohol with a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester (so two O's) and an alcohol? No, that would complicate.

Wait, but the presence of an -OH group (from the broad IR) and a carbonyl (IR at 1700) suggests the compound has both. So, if it's an ester, which has an O but no -OH, then the broad peak wouldn't fit unless the ester is part of a hemiacetal or something, which is less likely. So perhaps the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, which would require two O's. But wait, the formula in options with two O's are A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

Wait, so the IR has a broad peak (O-H), a carbonyl (C=O), and another peak at 1650, which could be another carbonyl or C=C.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have a lower wavenumber due to conjugation.

Let me think about the possible structures.

If the compound is an ester, then O2. But then where would the O-H come from? Esters don't have O-H groups. So perhaps that's not the case. So maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require O2. So the formula would be either A or C.

But let's think about the other data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

So, the compound has a double bond, a carbonyl group, and an -OH group.

Hmm. So maybe it's a phenol with a carbonyl and a double bond. But phenol would have a different IR spectrum, perhaps a strong peak around 1250-1300 for the aromatic O-H. But the given FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is more like an aliphatic O-H. So maybe it's an aliphatic alcohol with a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. But that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic alcohol with a ketone group.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but then the O would be two, but would it have an -OH? No, a lactone is an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alkenol, an alcohol with a double bond nearby.

Wait, let's think of the options. The formula with two O's is either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

The DoU is:

For A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 2*O)/2 → Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are 0, it's (14-12)/2= (2)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But we have a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (another double bond), so that would require DoU=2. So formula A would have DoU=1, which wouldn't account for two double bonds (the carbonyl and the vinyl). That's a problem.

Wait, wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate the DoU for each option.

For option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12) / 2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But the molecule has a double bond (vinyl H) and a carbonyl group (another double bond). So that's two DoU, which would require the formula to have DoU≥2. So formula A is DoU=1 → doesn't fit. So perhaps option A is out.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU calculation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Which would fit, because we have a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (another DoU). So that's possible.

So option C has two DoU, which matches the double bond and carbonyl. So that's possible.

But let's look at the mass spec. The fragment peak at 45. Hmm, what's 45? Let's think about possible ions. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (if that's 58, wait: 12*3 +16 +16= 36+32=68? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment with a CH2CO (44?), but that's 44. Hmm, 45 could be a CH2CH2O+? Or maybe a CH2O group (which is 30). Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2CO+ which is 72? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molecular weight of each option. The molecular formula is given, so let's compute their molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2 → (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O → 72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O →72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. So, in the options, the molecular formulas are all larger than 45, so the fragment is a part of the molecule.

What's a common fragment that would give m/z=45?

Well, 45 is (CH3CO)+ which is 43 (12*2 + 16 + 2*1 = 24 +16 +2=42?) Wait, no. Let me compute: 

CH3CO+ would be 12 (C) + 3×1 (CH3) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 12+3+12+16=43. So m/z=43. But the question says m/z=45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with a CH2CH2O group. CH2CH2O is 29 (12×2 + 5×1 +16=24+5+16=45?) Wait, no: CH2CH2O would be 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and one oxygen. So 2×12=24, 4×1=4, 16=16. Total 24+4+16=44. Oh, wait, that's 44. So that's close to 45. Hmm, maybe it's from a larger fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetate group (CH3COO−) which would have a mass of 60 (12×2 + 16×2 + 1×3? Hmm, wait, acetate is C2H3O2^−, so m/z would be 60. But the fragment is 45, so that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formulas are all C6. So if the molecular ion is, say, 116 (option A), then the most abundant fragment could be around 45. Let's think about what 45 could be in the context of each option.

For option C: C6H10O2. Suppose the molecule is something like an ester with a double bond. For example, maybe it's methyl cyclohex-2-enoate? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl ester or similar.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl acrylate. Wait, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's see, the formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6, so that's not matching.

Wait, but the problem states that the compound is C6. So perhaps it's an ester with a six-carbon structure. Maybe something like cyclohexene with an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester substituent.

But perhaps the fragment in the mass spectrum comes from a smaller part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), the formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6. So perhaps it's a larger ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a ketone group. Let's see: if the molecule has a ketone and an ester, but that would require two carbonyls and thus two O's. So the formula would be O2.

Wait, but let's think about the mass spec. The m/z=45 is a fragment. So perhaps the compound breaks into a smaller piece of 45. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's C7...), but our options are C6.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is an ortho ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a six-membered ring breaking into a five and a one-carbon fragment, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mass peak at 45 corresponds to a (CH3)2CO+ ion. Let's compute that: (CH3)2CO is (2×12) + (6×1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh, that's 46. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group: 2 C's, 4 H's, and one O: 2×12=24, 4×1=4, 16=16. Total 24+4+16=44. Close to 45 but not exactly.

Another approach: maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which would have a molecular weight of 114. If the molecular ion is at m/z=114, then the fragment at 45 would suggest losing 69 (114-45=69). What could lose 69? Maybe a fragment like (CH2)3COOH, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes cleavage to lose a group with molecular weight 69, leaving a fragment of 45.

Wait, another angle: what functional groups are present? The FTIR has a broad peak (O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (maybe C=C or another C=O). The NMR has vinyl protons, meaning a double bond.

Putting it all together: the compound has an -OH group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond.

So possible structures:

- A beta-hydroxy ketone: which has both an -OH and a ketone (C=O), and perhaps a double bond elsewhere.

But would that fit the molecular formulas?

Wait, but in that case, the double bond would be part of the structure. For example, something like cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group.

But the molecular formula would have to include O2. Let me see: cyclohexenone is C6H8O. If there's an -OH, that would make it C6H8O2. But that's not one of the options. The options with O2 are A and C, which are C6H12O2 and C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group. No, but then where would the double bond come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group. But esters have O2, so the formula would be O2. But then if it's an ester, it wouldn't have an -OH group. So that's conflicting.

Wait, unless the compound is a hemiacetal, but that's more common in sugars. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, but that would have O2. So formula could be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C). Earlier, I thought option A has DoU=1, which wouldn't account for two double bonds (the carbonyl and the vinyl), but wait, let me double-check:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 2*O)/2 → Wait, O is 2. Wait, no, the formula is C6H12O2. So DoU is (14 -12)/2=1. So only one double bond or ring. But the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (another double bond), so two DoU needed. So option A can't be, because it only has one DoU.

So option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (14 -10)/2=2. So two DoU, which fits the two double bonds.

So the formula must be option C or another with two DoU.

So the structure could be an ester with a double bond, but how does the O-H come into play?

Wait, perhaps the compound is a glycol ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require O2.

Wait, but let's think of another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOEt. Its formula is C5H8O3, which is not matching the options here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid ester. Like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an orthoester, but I'm not familiar with that.

Another angle: the mass spec fragment at 45.

Let me think of the possible fragments for each formula.

For option C: C6H10O2.

Suppose the molecular ion is at 114 (12×6 +10×1 +16×2=72+10+32=114). If the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. What's a common 69 fragment? Maybe a cyclopentyl group or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a (CH2)2CO group. Wait, let's compute:

(CH2)2CO: That's 2 carbons in CH2 groups, one C in CO. So 3 carbons, 4 H's (each CH2 has 2 H, so 4 H), and one O. So formula is C3H4O. Molecular weight: (3×12)+(4×1)+(16) = 36 +4 +16=56. So m/z=56. Not 45.

Hmm. Another possibility: a (CH2)3O group. 3 carbons, 7 H's (each CH2 has 2 H, so 3×2=6, plus the O attached to a CH2?), or wait: CH2CH2CH2O. That would be 3 C, 6 H, and O. So molecular weight: 3×12=36, 6×1=6, 16=16. Total 60. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a (CH3)CO group. That's 2 C, 3 H, and O. So 2×12=24, 3×1=3, 16=16. Total 24+3+16=43. Close to 45 but not quite.

Wait, another thought: if the fragment is an ethyl group attached to something. Like CH2CH2O group would be 44, as I calculated earlier. But the mass is 45. So maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O plus a methyl group? No, that would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)2O+ which is 44. But the mass is 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen. Wait, propyl is C3H7, but with an O, perhaps OCH2CH2CH3? That's 3 carbons, 7 H's, and an O. So molecular weight: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Total 60. No, that's 60.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)1.5 group? No, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. For example, CH3-O-CH2CH2... but I'm not sure.

Another approach: think of the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think of possible structures with that formula. An ester with a double bond, for example, could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's C6H10O2.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is ethyl acrylate. Let me count: 

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So together, it's C6H11O2. But the formula given is C6H10O2. So it's C6H11O2, but the formula is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. For example, cyclopentene ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester.

But perhaps considering the NMR, which shows vinyl hydrogens, the structure has a double bond.

Let me think about the possible structures for option C, C6H10O2.

It's an ester with a double bond and an -OH group? But esters don't have -OH groups. So this is confusing.

Wait, unless the compound is a diester. But that would require more than two O's, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone and an ester, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. But lactones are cyclic esters and don't have -OH groups. Unless it's a lactone with a hydroxyl group, but that's less common.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak in the IR is not an -OH. Could it be an N-H stretch? No, because the options don't have N.

Wait, another possibility: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be an amide N-H stretch, but again, the options don't have N. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is a C-O stretch in an ether. But ethers don't have a broad peak; their C-O is around 1050-1250 cm-1, a sharp peak. So the broad peak is more likely O-H.

So back to the options: the compound has O-H, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

The options that fit O2 and have two DoU are A and C. But A has DoU=1, which doesn't fit two double bonds, so C is the only option with two DoU and O2.

So the formula must be C6H10O2.

But let's confirm with the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, and the molecular formula is C6H10O2, what could produce a 45 fragment?

Wait, if the compound is methyl vinyl ether maleate or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester is CH3O(CO)CH2CH2CH=CH2, then the ester part is O(CO)OCH3. The fragment could be the OCH3 group, which is 31 (15 + 16). Not matching 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the ketone part. If the compound has a ketone group, perhaps (CH3)2CO would break off, but that's 58. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: the mass spectrum fragment at 45 could correspond to the molecular ion of a fragment with the formula C3H7O. Let's compute: 3×12=36, 7×1=7, 16=16. Total 60. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Yes! C2H5O is 45. So, the fragment could be CH2CH2O, which is C2H4O. Wait, wait: C2H5O would have a molecular weight of 2*12 +5*1 +16=24+5+16=45. So the fragment could be CH2CH2O, but that's C2H4O (44). Oh wait, no, because C2H5O has 5 hydrogens. So maybe it's a (CH2CH2O) with one extra H. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group attached to something else, but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound undergoes cleavage to lose a group of molecular weight 69 (114-45=69), but I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, another approach: what's the molecular formula of the fragment? If the fragment is m/z=45, its formula could be C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16=45). So C3H7O.

How could that come from the molecule? Maybe from a part of the structure.

If the molecule is an ester with a side chain that includes a C3H7O group. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is C3H7O. Wait, no, because R would have to be an alkyl group, not containing an O.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a propyl group. So, for example, propyl something. But the exact structure is unclear.

Wait, but since the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O (45), perhaps the molecule has a propyl group attached to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2CH3 (45? Let me compute: O is 16, CH2CH2CH3 is 15 (12+3). So 16+15=31. No, that's 31.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2OCH3: that's 44 (12*3 + 4 + 16=36+4+16=56). No, that's 56.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to focus on the spectroscopic data rather than the mass spec.

So, for the IR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm-1: likely O-H.

- Peaks at 1700 and 1650: probably a carbonyl (C=O) and C=C (maybe conjugated).

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which means a double bond.

So the structure likely has both a carbonyl and a double bond, along with an -OH group.

The options that fit:

- O2, so either A or C.

- Two DoU: only option C (DoU=2).

So the formula must be C6H10O2.

Now, looking at the mass spec, the fragment at 45 is likely from a part of the molecule. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group (44), which is close but not exactly. Alternatively, another structure.

But given the other data strongly points to option C, I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated C=C bond. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45.

### Analysis of the Options:

   - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2 = (14 - 12)/2 = 1.  
   - This indicates only one double bond or ring, but the compound has both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), requiring DoU = 2.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   - DoU = (14 - 10)/2 = 2.  
   - This matches the two double bonds (C=O and C=C). However, the compound must have an O-H group (from the broad IR peak), which would require at least two oxygens.  
   - **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   - DoU = (14 - 10)/2 = 2.  
   - This matches the two double bonds (C=O and C=C). The presence of two oxygens allows for both the O-H group (broad IR peak) and the carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The molecular formula also aligns with the mass spectrum, as a fragment with m/z = 45 could correspond to a C₂H₅O group.  
   - **Matches all data.**

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   - DoU = (14 - 12)/2 = 1.  
   - This indicates only one double bond or ring, but the compound has both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), requiring DoU = 2.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation, an O-H group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. The only formula that satisfies all these criteria is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
