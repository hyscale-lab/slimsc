Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios like 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Hmm, first, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain, which has different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches, right? Each branch produces neutrinos of different energies.

Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. So, I think the pp-III branch is one of the later stages in the pp chain. I'm a bit hazy on the details. Let me recall. The pp chain starts with protons fusing into deuterium, then into helium-3. Then, I think the pp-I branch is where two helium-3 nuclei (He3) fuse into helium-4, releasing two protons. But wait, that would produce a positron and a neutrino? Or is that another process?

Alternatively, the pp-II branch is when a He3 captures a He4 to make He5, which is unstable and decays into two He3. Wait, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe the pp-III branch involves the fusion of He3 and another He3, but with a different pathway. Or wait, I think pp-III is about the beta decay steps, where maybe a proton captures a neutron or something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the neutrino types. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos. The pp chain produces neutrinos in different stages. The primary pp reactions produce lower-energy neutrinos, but the higher branches may contribute to higher energy ones.

Wait, the pp-III branch—I think it's when a boron-8 nucleus undergoes further reactions. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch produces the highest energy neutrinos. Because in the pp chain, the main neutrinos are from the beta decay steps. Let's see, the initial steps: in the first step of the pp chain, two protons fuse to form deuterium, then another proton fuses, and then a neutron emits a positron and a neutrino. That's the first beta decay, producing a neutrino with lower energy, maybe around 0.4 MeV or so.

But then, in the pp-III branch, which is part of the later stages, perhaps when boron-8 captures a proton to form beryllium-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei. In this process, each decay would produce a higher-energy neutrino. Wait, I think the neutrinos produced in the boron-8 decay are higher energy, around 15-20 MeV. Oh wait, no, maybe that's the pep branch, which is a small contributor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to organize this. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp chain, which has three main branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-I is the main branch where two He3 nuclei fuse into He4, which produces two protons, and in the process, a beta decay occurs, releasing a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos would be lower, maybe around 0.4 MeV each.

Then, the pp-II branch is when a He3 captures a proton to form Be7, which then captures another proton to form B8, which then decays into two He4 nuclei. This might produce higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around a few MeV.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. Alternatively, pp-III could be part of the process where a He4 nucleus captures two He3 nuclei to form heavier elements, but I think that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is when a He3 captures a neutron, but wait, the Sun's core is mostly protons, so neutrons are scarce. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is where a Be7 captures a neutron, but that's more in the CNO cycle, which I think is not the main process in the Sun. Wait, no—the CNO cycle is a different fusion process, more prominent in higher-mass stars than the Sun.

Wait, perhaps it's better to focus on the neutrino energies. The question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV range. Wait, 0.7 to 0.8 MeV and 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. That's in the 1 MeV ballpark. So that's higher than the standard pp neutrinos.

Wait, the standard pp neutrinos are from the beta decays in the chain. The first beta decay in the pp chain (like from D to He3) produces neutrinos around 0.4 MeV. The others, perhaps higher. For example, the decay in the pep branch (proton-electron-proton) produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV. But that's a minor contributor.

Wait, but the problem states that the pp-III branch stops. If the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the flux in higher energy bands, but leave the lower ones unaffected.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stopped, what happens to the neutrino flux at different energies?

Assuming that the pp-III branch is a main source of neutrinos in the higher energy ranges, say, around 0.8-1 MeV, then if it's stopped, the flux in those higher bands would drop, while the lower bands remain the same.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900 keV). So if the pp-III produces more neutrinos in band2 than in band1, then stopping it would cause band2 flux to drop more than band1, leading to a higher ratio (flux1/flux2) increasing.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the main source for band2, so without it, band2's flux would be lower than band1's, making the ratio higher than 1.

Wait, but let me think again. The Sun's neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The higher-energy ones come from the CNO cycle perhaps, but the Sun isn't dominant in that. Wait, no, the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the pep branch is a small part of the pp chain that produces higher energy neutrinos.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the 1-2 MeV range. If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like band2) would drop, but the lower bands (like band1) might not be affected much because they're from other branches.

So the original scenario is that all other reactions remain as they were. So the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, and the CNO cycle (if any) is active as well.

Wait, but do the pp branches other than III contribute to the 700-800 keV range? Because if pp-III is the only one contributing to higher energies, then stopping pp-III would significantly reduce band2's flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in the 0.8-1 MeV range. So, in that case, the flux in band2 would drop, while band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) might come from another process, like the main pp branches.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the energy distributions. Let me think: the standard pp chain's main neutrino production is around 0.4 MeV, but maybe some of the other branches produce higher energies.

I recall that the dominant neutrino flux from the Sun is due to the beta decay in the pp chain, which is around 0.4 MeV. The pep branch produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV but is much less abundant. The CNO cycle would produce higher neutrino energies, but the Sun's contribution is small compared to the pp chain.

Wait, but if pp-III is a branch that produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps in the 0.7-1 MeV range, then its stopping would reduce the flux in band2 more than band1.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band2 (800-900 keV), then without them, the flux in band2 drops. But band1 (700-800 keV) might not be as affected, perhaps because it's from a different branch.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the pp-III neutrinos are in band2. Let's say pp-III produces neutrinos in band2. Then, without pp-III, band2's flux is lower. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be higher than before.

But what was the original ratio? Let's imagine that before stopping, band2's flux was higher than band1's. So, if pp-III contributes more to band2, then stopping it would make band2's flux drop, making the ratio band1/band2 increase.

Alternatively, perhaps band1 and band2 are both from the same process, and band2 is higher in energy. But if the pp-III is the main contributor to higher energy neutrinos, then stopping it would make the higher energy flux drop more than the lower.

Wait, let's think of the neutrino spectrum. The standard pp chain has a neutrino spectrum peaking around 0.4 MeV, but there are other components. The pep branch gives higher energy neutrinos, but they are a small fraction. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, but it's a minor part of the Sun's fusion.

But the question is about the pp-III branch, so perhaps it's an internal branch of the pp chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos. So, if pp-III is stopped, then the higher-energy neutrinos (like those in band2) would drop, leaving the lower-energy ones (band1) the same.

So, the flux in band1 comes from pp-I and pp-II, which are still active. The flux in band2 comes mainly from pp-III, which is now stopped. So after stopping, band2's flux is zero (assuming no other contributions). But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were, so other branches (pp-I, II) are active.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the current state, 8.5 minutes ago, the pp-III stopped. So, the neutrinos would have had time to reach Earth. The time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth is about 8 minutes, right? Because the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from the pp-III process would have just arrived now. So, the neutrinos from processes that stopped 8.5 minutes ago are just arriving, but for the present time, the pp-III is not producing any new neutrinos.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The time it takes for the neutrinos to reach Earth from the Sun's core is about 8 minutes. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from the pp-III that were produced before the stoppage are still on their way to Earth. So, for the next few minutes, Earth would still receive neutrinos from pp-III that were produced just before the stoppage. But after that, there would be no pp-III neutrinos reaching Earth.

Hmm, but the question is about the current flux ratio. So, the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos from the Sun's core have just arrived. So, the neutrinos that were produced in the pp-III process before the stoppage are now reaching Earth, but any neutrinos produced after the stoppage (if any) wouldn't contribute. So, the pp-III is not producing any new neutrinos now, but the existing ones are just arriving.

But wait, if the pp-III process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have taken 8 minutes to reach Earth, so they arrive now. But any neutrinos produced after that would not be from the pp-III process anymore. So, for the current time, the pp-III process is not contributing any new neutrinos. So the neutrinos we are detecting now are from the processes that were active up until 8.5 minutes ago.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this point. Let me try to simplify. The neutrinos from the Sun's core take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So, the Sun's core events that happened 8 minutes ago are just being observed now. If the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that stoppage event would have been produced 8.5 minutes ago, but they take 8 minutes to reach Earth. So, those neutrinos are arriving now, but any neutrinos produced in the 0.5 minutes after the stoppage (if any) would take longer than 8 minutes, so perhaps they're not arriving yet. So, for the current neutrino flux, the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so any neutrinos produced after that (if any) are yet to arrive.

Wait, but in reality, the neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core and travel at near-light speed, so it's about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So, the neutrinos produced in the Sun's core just before the stoppage (say, 8 minutes ago) would arrive now. Neutrinos produced after the stoppage (like in the last half minute before the current time) would not arrive yet, but since the process stopped, there are no such neutrinos.

So, the current neutrino flux from the Sun includes the neutrinos from pp-III that were produced just before the stoppage. So, for the current observation, the pp-III process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is just in time for the neutrinos from that process to arrive now. So, the neutrinos from pp-III are arriving, but any new ones (if any) are not yet here.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio, so perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III are negligible now because they stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Because the neutrinos from pp-III are just arriving now, but the production stopped, so for the future, there will be no new pp-III neutrinos. But as of now, the detectors are seeing the last batch of pp-III neutrinos.

But perhaps for the sake of this question, the main point is about the neutrino production, not the time delay. So, the pp-III stopped, so the neutrino flux it contributes is now zero, while others are still active.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the standpoint of the production rates. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a certain energy range. If it's stopped, then the flux in those energy bands will drop, while others remain the same.

So, if the pp-III is the main source for higher energy neutrinos (like in band2), then stopping it would cause band2's flux to drop. The flux in band1 (700-800 keV) might come from other branches, so it's less affected.

So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be (unchanged band1 flux)/(reduced band2 flux). If band2's flux was higher before, then the ratio would increase.

But what was the original ratio? If the pp-III contributes more to band2 than band1, then the flux in band2 is higher. So, without pp-III, band2's flux drops, making the ratio band1/band2 higher.

But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps band1 and band2 are in the same energy range, and the flux is dominated by the same process. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. The dominant contribution comes from the pp chain, with a peak around 0.4 MeV, but there are other components. The pep branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, but it's a minor part.

So, if the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, stopping it would have a small effect. But if it's a major contributor to certain energy bands, then the effect is more significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV. So, stopping it would cause the flux in band2 (800-900 keV) to drop, but band1 (700-800) remains similar.

In that case, the ratio band1/band2 would be (unchanged band1)/(reduced band2). So the ratio increases.

But without knowing the exact contribution of pp-III to each band, it's hard to know the exact ratio. But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III branch produces the bulk of the higher-energy neutrinos. So, when it stops, the higher energy bands (like band2) lose a significant portion of their flux, while the lower bands (like band1) are less affected.

Suppose that before stopping, band2 had a flux F2 and band1 had F1. If the pp-III contributed a large fraction of F2 but not much to F1, then stopping it would cause F2 to drop, while F1 remains roughly F1.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase. If F1 was, say, 10% of F2 before, then after stopping, F2 could drop to 10% of its original, making F1/F2 = (0.1 F2_initial)/(0.1 F2_initial) =1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe F1 was 10% of F2, then after pp-III stops, F2 is 10% of its original. So F1 remains same, F2 is 10% of what it was. So F1/F2 becomes (0.1 F2) / (0.1 F2) = 1. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should model it with numbers. Let's say, before stopping, the flux in band1 is F1=100, and band2 F2=1000. So the ratio is 100/1000=0.1.

But if the pp-III was the main contributor to band2, say, contributing 900 out of 1000 in F2. So, when it stops, F2 drops to 100 (from other sources). So, F1 is still 100, F2 is 100. Ratio is 1.

Wait, but the question is what happens after the pp-III stops. So F2 was mainly due to pp-III. So, if F2 was 1000 before, and now without pp-III, F2 is 100 (from other sources). F1 was 100, which is from other branches, so it remains 100. So ratio is 100/100 =1, which is option C.

But wait, in this scenario, the ratio increases from 0.1 to 1. But the question doesn't state that the other branches contribute to band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the other branches don't contribute much to band2. So, F2 would drop to close to zero. Then, F1 is 100, F2 is 10: ratio 10.

But why would F2 drop to 10? Because perhaps pp-III contributed almost all of F2.

Wait, but if pp-III contributes to both band1 and band2, but more to band2, then stopping it would cause F2 to drop more than F1.

But without exact data, it's hard to know. But I'm thinking that the pp-III might be the main contributor to the higher energy bands.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III branch is responsible for producing the bulk of the higher energy neutrinos. So, without pp-III, the flux above a certain energy (like 800 keV) drops significantly.

In that case, the flux in band2 would be almost zero (because all the neutrinos in that band came from pp-III), while band1 would remain unaffected.

So, band1's flux is F1, band2's flux is F2=0. Then the ratio is F1 / 0. But that's undefined. But in reality, perhaps other processes contribute a small amount to band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes 99% of band2's flux, and other processes contribute 1%. So, when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to 1% of F2_initial.

If F1 was, say, same as initial F2 (unlikely), but perhaps F1 is 10, F2_initial is 100. So F2 after stoppage is 1. So ratio is 10/1 =10, which is option A.

But I'm not certain. I think the correct approach is that the pp-III branch produces a significant amount of the higher-energy neutrinos, so stopping it would reduce the higher energy flux more than the lower.

If the pp-III is the main source for band2, then the flux in band2 would drop, making the ratio band1/band2 increase.

If the original ratio was around 1, then after stopping, band2 is lower, making the ratio larger than 1. But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

But wait, is pp-III the only source for band2? If so, then the flux in band2 would be zero. But that's not realistic because the question says other reactions remain, so perhaps other branches produce some neutrinos in band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main source for neutrinos in band2 (800-900 keV), and only a minor source for band1.

So, stopping pp-III would cause a significant drop in band2's flux, but not much in band1.

Suppose that without pp-III, band2's flux is a tenth of what it was, while band1's remains roughly the same.

So, if before, band1 was 100, band2 was 100 => ratio 1.

After pp-III stops, band1 is 100, band2 is 10 => ratio 10 => option A.

Alternatively, if band1 was 10 and band2 was 100, ratio 0.1.

Wait, but without knowing the exact contribution, it's hard. But the question asks for the approximate ratio after the pp-III stops.

I think the key is that the pp-III process contributes mainly to higher-energy neutrinos. So, if it's stopped, the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would have much less flux, while the lower bands (700-800) might have similar flux.

So, the ratio of band1 to band2 would be higher, possibly around 10. So option A is 10.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the pp-III contributes neutrinos at higher energies, so band2's flux is much larger than band1's. When pp-III stops, band2's flux drops, making the ratio band1/band2 increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process is the only source for band2, so without it, band2's flux would be zero, making the ratio infinity, but that's not an option. So maybe the other processes contribute a small amount.

Wait, another possibility: the pp-III produces neutrinos in a certain energy range which includes both band1 and band2. So, perhaps the majority of the higher energy neutrinos are in band2, but a smaller fraction in band1.

If pp-III contributed, say, 90% of band2 and 10% of band1, then stopping it would make band2 flux drop to 10% of its original, and band1 to 90% of its original.

So, if band1 was 100 and band2 was 1000 before (ratio 0.1), after pp-III stops, band1 becomes 90 and band2 becomes 100 (so ratio 90/100=0.9, which is near 1, so option C).

But the question is about the ratio after the stoppage. If the pp-III was the main contributor to band2, then the ratio would increase.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos in higher energies, so band2's flux is higher than band1's. So, the original ratio is F1/F2=0.1. After pp-III stops, F2 drops, so F1/F2 becomes 1.

In that case, the ratio would be 1, which is option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III contributes to both bands but more to band2.

If the pp-III contributes, say, 50% to band1 and 90% to band2, then after stopping, band1 is 50% of original, band2 is 10% of original.

So, if F1 was 100, F2 was 100 before, F1 becomes 50, F2 becomes 10. Ratio is 50/10=5, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III doesn't contribute much to band1, but contributes a lot to band2. So, F1 is unchanged, F2 drops by a lot.

So, if F1 was 100, F2 was 1000, ratio was 0.1. After stoppage, F2 drops to 100 (from other sources), F1 remains 100. Ratio becomes 1.

That would be option C.

But the options don't include 0.1 becoming 1 as an option. Wait, the options are given as the ratio after the stoppage.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band2, and a negligible source in band1.

In that case, F1 is unchanged, F2 drops to almost zero. So, the ratio F1/F2 would be very large, perhaps 10.

But the options are A:10, B:0.01, C:1, D:0.1.

So, if F2 is almost zero, the ratio would be very large, which would suggest A:10.

But the question says the ratio is after the stoppage, but other reactions are still active. So, perhaps other reactions contribute a small amount to both bands.

If pp-III contributed all of band2's flux, then without it, band2's flux is zero, but that's not realistic. So, perhaps the other processes contribute a small part.

But without knowing the exact contributions, I'll have to make an educated guess.

I think the correct answer is C) 1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos in a certain energy range that includes both bands, but more in band2. So, without pp-III, the flux in both bands decreases, but band2 more. So, the ratio could be 1.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: if the pp-III branch is responsible for a significant fraction of the high-energy neutrinos, then the flux in higher bands decreases, making the lower bands appear more dominant.

In that case, the ratio would increase.

If the original flux ratio was 1 (i.e., same in both bands), stopping pp-III would make band2 less, so the ratio increases to 10, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think about the possible energy ranges again.

The main pp chain neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV. The pep branch is around 1.4 MeV. The CNO cycle produces higher neutrinos, but the Sun's contribution is small.

The question is about 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). These are in the 1 MeV range. The pep branch's neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2. So, perhaps the pp-III is a branch that produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.

Wait, if that's the case, then stopping pp-III would cause the flux in both bands to drop, but more in band2. So, the ratio band1/band2 would increase.

For example, if before stopping, band1 was 100 and band2 was 1000, ratio 0.1. After stopping, if pp-III contributed 90% of band2 and 50% of band1, then band1 becomes 50 and band2 becomes 100. Ratio becomes 0.5, which is not an option.

Alternatively, pp-III contributes 90% of band2 and 90% of band1. So, band1 goes from 100 to 10, band2 from 1000 to 100. Ratio is 10/100=0.1, same as before. So, the ratio remains the same, option D.

But that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band2 than band1.

In that case, after stopping, band2's flux drops more than band1's.

So, if before, band1 was 100, band2 was 1000, ratio 0.1.

After stopping, if band1 is 100, band2 is 500 (because pp-III contributed 500 to band2), then ratio is 2.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes 90% to band2 and 10% to band1.

So, before stopping: band1=100, band2=1000.

After stopping: band1=10, band2=100.

Ratio becomes 10/100=0.1, which is option D.

But that seems counterintuitive because band2's flux would drop more, but the ratio would decrease.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band2, and a minor source in band1. So, when it stops, band2's flux drops, but band1's is less affected.

So, if band1 was 100, band2 was 1000 (ratio 0.1), and after stopping, band1 is 100, band2 is 100 (because other sources contribute 10% to band2). Then the ratio becomes 1.

That's option C.

But why would other sources contribute 10% to band2? Maybe other branches of the pp chain contribute a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes to both bands, but more to band2. So, when it stops, band2's flux drops more than band1's.

In this case, the ratio would increase.

Another approach: when the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in higher energies (band2) decreases more. So, the ratio of lower to higher energy flux increases.

If the original ratio was 1 (band1 and band2 had same flux), after stopping pp-III, the ratio becomes 10, option A.

So, putting it all together, I'm not entirely certain, but the most plausible answer seems to be option D: 0.1. No, wait, that's the original ratio. I think the correct answer is option D:0.1.

Wait, no, after the stoppage, the flux in band2 drops, so the ratio band1/band2 increases.

If the original ratio was 0.1 (band1 is 10% of band2), then after stopping, if band2 drops to 10% of its original, the ratio becomes 10.

So, the answer would be A) 10.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the ratio could stay the same if the pp-III contributes equally to both bands, but that's unlikely.

I think the correct answer is A) 10.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is known to produce higher-energy neutrinos, and its cessation would significantly reduce the flux in the higher-energy band (800-900 keV), while the lower-energy band (700-800 keV) would remain less affected.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**: The Sun's dominant neutrino production comes from the proton-proton (pp) chain. The pp chain has several branches, including pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, likely in the 0.8-1 MeV range, which corresponds to the bands in question.

2. **Impact of Stopping pp-III**: If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in the higher-energy band (800-900 keV) would drop significantly, as this branch is a major contributor to neutrinos in this range. The lower-energy band (700-800 keV) would be less affected, as it receives contributions from other branches of the pp chain.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**: Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher-energy band (band 2) is likely larger than that in the lower-energy band (band 1). After the stoppage, the flux in band 2 drops significantly, while the flux in band 1 remains relatively unchanged. This causes the ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2 (flux1/flux2) to increase.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (10)**: This suggests that the ratio increases significantly, which aligns with the expectation that the flux in band 2 drops more than the flux in band 1.
   - **Option B (0.01)**: This implies a very small ratio, which is inconsistent with the scenario where band 1 remains largely unaffected while band 2 decreases.
   - **Option C (1)**: This suggests the ratio remains unchanged, which is unlikely given the significant reduction in band 2 flux.
   - **Option D (0.1)**: This implies band 2 flux is much larger than band 1 flux, but it does not account for the increase in the ratio after the pp-III branch stops.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible scenario is that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to the flux in band 2, and its stoppage causes a substantial drop in band 2 flux, leading to an increase in the ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux. Among the given options, the ratio of 10 (Option A) best matches this reasoning.

**Answer: A**
