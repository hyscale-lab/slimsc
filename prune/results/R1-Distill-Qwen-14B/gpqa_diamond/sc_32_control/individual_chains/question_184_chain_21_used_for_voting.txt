Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions, and I need to pick the correct sequence.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, actually, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me make sure I get the positions right. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3? Or maybe it's another arrangement. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1,2,3 in order. So the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they are adjacent in a row.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. The substituents can be introduced via electrophilic substitution reactions. But the order in which they are added will affect the positions due to directing effects.

So, benzene can undergo substitution reactions. Each substituent will direct the next substitution to certain positions. Let's think about the groups being added.

The substituents are ethoxy (which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group), tert-butyl (a bulky, deactivating, meta-directing group), and nitro (a strong deactivating, meta-directing group).

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group because it's an electron-donating OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, right? Oh wait, the substituent is ethoxy, which is OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. tert-butyl is (CH2CH3)3C-; ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out the order in which these substituents are added. Because the order will determine the positions.

Let me think: suppose I first add the ethoxy group. Benzene undergoes an alkylation via Friedel-Crafts for ethoxy? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides to benzene. Wait, ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. To introduce an ethoxy group, you can use an etherification reaction. Alternatively, maybe using a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, it's done via electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps using a tosylate or some other method.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's not common unless the ring is activated. Alternatively, perhaps using an alkyl chloride and AlCl3 as a catalyst, but wait, that's for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which typically doesn't work for ethoxy, since ethoxy isn't a strong enough activating group. Wait, maybe it's better to use an ether group via another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a methoxy group via some alkylation, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by some other steps, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first.

Wait, but another approach is to think about which groups are meta-directing and which are ortho/para. So, ethoxy is activating and directs ortho/para. The tert-butyl is deactivating (since it's an alkyl group attached via a tertiary carbocation, which is deactivating) and meta-directing. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, no, actually, alkyl groups are activating. Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Alkyl groups are activating, meaning they are electron-donating via inductive effects, making the ring more reactive. So a tert-butyl group is an activating, but it's a bulky group, so it's meta-directing because of steric hindrance. Wait no, wait: activating groups are typically ortho/para directors. But bulky activating groups might direct meta because they can't fit into the ortho positions. For example, a bulky group like tert-butyl would be meta-directing because the ortho positions are too crowded. So, tert-butyl is activating (since it's alkyl) but because it's bulky, it directs incoming groups to the meta position.

Wait, but then again, if a group is meta-directing, whether activating or deactivating, that affects where the next substituent goes.

So, let's think about the target molecule: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, they are all adjacent. That suggests that perhaps the substituents are added in a way that each directs the next substitution to the adjacent position.

But wait, let's think about the synthesis steps. Let's consider the order of adding substituents. Let's think about which substituent is introduced first, second, third.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl, and nitro.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's better to add it early because once it's on the ring, it deactivates it, making further substitution harder. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added last because it's a strong deactivating group and would make the ring less reactive.

Wait, but another approach is to identify which substituent is added first. Let's consider that the ethoxy group is an activating group, so it might be easier to add it first. Then, the next substituent would be either the tert-butyl or nitro.

Wait, let's plan the substitution steps.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Then, add nitro, then tert-butyl. Let's see.

First step: benzene → benzene with ethoxy group. Let's see how that would be done.

To introduce an ethoxy group, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution on a tosylate or something, but I think the usual method is via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's tricky for ethers. Alternatively, maybe using a Williamson ether synthesis approach, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using OCH2CH3 as a substituent via an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a strong acid. Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an alkyl halide, but for alkylation, the alkyl group must be activated. Wait, but benzene can be alkylated to form ethylbenzene, but I'm not sure about adding an ethoxy group directly. Alternatively, perhaps using an ether as an electrophile, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by some other reaction. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced in a later step. Let me think about the substituents' directing effects.

Suppose I first introduce the tert-butyl group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group, so it would direct incoming substituents to the meta position. So, after adding the tert-butyl, the next substituent would go meta to it.

Then, perhaps I add the nitro group, which is meta to the tert-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, so the next substituent might be harder to add.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then add the nitro group, then add the tert-butyl group.

Wait, let's consider the positions. If I add ethoxy first, the next substitution would be directed by ethoxy. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. So, the next substituent would go ortho or para to it.

But in the target molecule, the substituents are adjacent, so perhaps the next group is added ortho to the ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy, the next groups are added in a way that they are adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added next, but nitro is meta-directing and deactivating. So, if I add nitro after ethoxy, where would it go?

Wait, let's say benzene is first treated with ethoxy group. So, the ring is activated. The next substituent, let's say nitro, would go ortho or para to the ethoxy. Then, the tert-butyl would be added, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is added next, which, being a bulky activating group, would direct the next substituent to the meta position relative to itself.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

Wait, the steps in A are: i, ii, iv, iii, etc., but maybe I should look for the order.

Wait, looking quickly:

Option A's steps: i) Alkylation with tert-butyl; ii) nitration; then iii) SO3 (sulfonation?), but then iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), v) dilute H2SO4 (maybe hydrolysis?), vi) H3O+ and heat (possibly steam distillation?), vii) NaOH with EtBr (alkylation again?), viii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), and ix) HNO3 again.

Hmm, this seems complicated. I'll come back to that.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction. Wait, Fe/HCl usually isn't for reduction; maybe it's for something else. Or perhaps it's for a different step.

iv) HNO3 again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol?).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

But I'm not sure.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps, but perhaps it's adding multiple nitro groups, which doesn't make sense for the target molecule.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iii) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

So, the order here is nitration first, then reduction (Fe/HCl), then tert-butyl, then another nitration, etc.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence starts with adding the ethoxy group. But none of the options start with adding an ethoxy group. Let me look again.

Looking at each option's first step:

Option A: i) tert-butyl.

Option B: same.

Option C: same.

Option D: i) nitration.

So, none of the options start with an ethoxy. Hmm, that can't be right. So, maybe the ethoxy is added via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if benzene is converted into a benzene chloride, and then an ethoxide ion displaces it. But I'm not sure if that's a common reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using an ethyl chloride, but Friedel-Crafts typically doesn't work for adding aryl ethers directly. Wait, perhaps using a different method, like the use of SOCl2 to convert an alcohol to a chloride, but that requires an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced after the benzene has some substituents. For example, perhaps after sulfonation, which would activate the ring in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been made sufficiently activated through other substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another approach. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about the order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring.

Since nitro groups are strong meta directors and deactivating, it's often better to add them last because once the ring is deactivated, it's harder to add more substituents. Alternatively, if the nitro group is added early, perhaps the other substituents can be added in positions directed by it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first because it's an activating group, making the ring more reactive for subsequent substitutions. Then, adding the tert-butyl (which is bulky and meta-directing), which would influence where the next substituent goes.

Wait, suppose the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group → activating, ortho/para directing.

2. Add nitro group → which would go to ortho or para of ethoxy.

3. Add tert-butyl group → which would go meta to nitro and ortho or para to ethoxy.

But I'm not sure if that leads to the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro.

Wait, let's imagine:

Step 1: Benzene → benzene with ethoxy (OCH2CH3) via Friedel-Crafts? No, because Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not ether introduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via some other means, like using a tosylate and then displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making a suitable leaving group. For that, maybe the benzene is first made into a tosyl chloride derivative, then treated with ethoxide. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a diethyl sulfate in the presence of a strong acid, which could introduce the ethoxy group as a substituent. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a side reaction in one of the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method, such as using a benzene diethyl ether.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at each option's steps, perhaps the key is to see which sequence of substituents leads to the correct positions.

Another approach is to consider that the tert-butyl group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which would require the ring to be activated. So, if the ring is already substituted with an activating group, that would facilitate the Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the substituents.

The target molecule has ethoxy (activating, o/p-directing), tert-butyl (activating, but due to bulk, m-directing), and nitro (deactivating, m-directing).

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so when it's present, it makes the ring less reactive, which could complicate adding more substituents.

So, perhaps the nitro group is added last, because once it's there, the ring is less reactive, making further substitution difficult.

So, the steps might be: add ethoxy, add tert-butyl, then add nitro.

But let's see, if I first add ethoxy to benzene, the ring is activated. Next, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would work because the ring is activated. The ethoxy group is ortho/para directing, so the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

In the target, the tert-butyl is adjacent (position 2) to ethoxy (position 1), so that would require the tert-butyl to be added ortho to ethoxy. That's possible if the ethoxy directs the next substituent to the ortho position.

Then, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next step is adding nitro. But the ring is now less activated because the tert-butyl is a bulky group which may have some deactivating effect (but it's actually activating, being an alkyl group).

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two substituents. The next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the existing substituents. The ethoxy is o/p-directing, and the tert-butyl is m-directing. So, the nitro group would have to be in a position that is directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's look for the steps that include ethoxy introduction. Looking at the options, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an alkylation with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in the presence of NaOH. So, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution where the leaving group is replaced by ethoxide.

Wait, but in that case, which step in the options includes EtBr and NaOH? Looking at the options, some have steps with NaOH and EtBr.

Looking at option A: step vii) is NaOH/EtBr.

Option B: step vii) is NaOH/EtBr.

Option C: step ix) is NaOH/EtBr.

Option D: step ix) is NaOH/EtBr.

So, ethoxy introduction would be via a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps after some activation of the ring, like making a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a side chain activation. For example, if the ring has a nitro group, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced via some displacement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe let's think about each option's steps and see which leads to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Let's take option D:

The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? Fe/HCl is not a common reducing agent for nitro groups. Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis condition, but I'm not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

viii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

Wait, that's a lot of steps and seems complicated. Also, adding nitro groups twice might not make sense. The target has only one nitro group.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

Again, multiple nitrations seem off.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) nitration again.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) SO3.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, again multiple nitrations and not clear.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iv) SO3.

iii) HNO3 again.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, which would require a good leaving group on the benzene ring. One way to get a leaving group is to have a sulfonic acid group, which can be replaced by a nucleophile under certain conditions.

So perhaps the sequence involves sulfonation, then displacement with ethoxide.

Looking at the options, I see that some have SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation) steps.

So, if we sulfonate benzene, making benzenesulfonic acid. Then, perhaps replacing the sulfonic acid group with something else.

Wait, but benzenesulfonic acid is a strong acid and may not easily leave. Alternatively, perhaps making a mesylate or tosylate.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a good leaving group, which is then replaced by ethoxide via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution).

So, let's say:

1. Benzene → sulfonate (SO3/H2SO4) → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Convert the sulfonic acid to a leaving group, perhaps via treatment with a base to form a good leaving group, like a nitrate or a chloride. Alternatively, perhaps treatment with a strong base like NaOH would form a benzene ring with a sulfonate group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

3. Then, perform a nucleophilic substitution with an ethoxide ion to replace the sulfonate group with an ethoxy group.

Wait, but under what conditions does that happen? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps under strongly basic conditions with heat.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Sulfonate benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

- Then, treat with NaNO2 and HCl → diazotization? No, that's for amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is a good leaving group and can be replaced by ethoxide under strong basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, such as using an ethoxide nucleophile on a benzene ring with a good leaving group.

In that case, the ethoxy group would be introduced via a substitution reaction, which would require a good leaving group attached to the benzene.

So, perhaps the steps are:

i) Sulfonation: benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

ii) Treatment with NaOH → forms the sodium sulfonate, which is a good leaving group.

iii) Then, treatment with an ethylating agent, like ethyl bromide (EtBr), under basic conditions (like NaOH), leading to substitution of the sulfonate with ethoxy.

Wait, that sounds plausible. So, the steps would be:

1. Sulfonate benzene → SO3/H2SO4 → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. NaOH → converts sulfonic acid to sodium sulfonate, which is a good leaving group.

3. NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy group substitution.

But looking at the options, which option includes sulfonation followed by NaOH and EtBr?

Looking at the options:

Option A: step iii is SO3, step vii is NaOH/EtBr.

So, steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate, then iii) SO3 (sulfonate?), but that seems off.

Option C: step ii is SO3, then step iii is nitrate.

Wait, option C: i) tert-butyl, ii) SO3, iii) HNO3.

So, benzene → tert-butyl benzene via AlCl3. Then, sulfonate → (tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. Then nitrate. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: step ii is nitrate, step iii is Fe/HCl.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: step vi is SO3, step ix is NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, let's think again about each option's steps.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But Fe/HCl isn’t a common reducing agent for nitro groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a workup.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again, which would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So, that's likely incorrect.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl → benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene.

ii) nitrate → adds nitro group, which is ortho/para to tert-butyl, but tert-butyl is bulky and may direct meta.

Wait, but tert-butyl is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur ortho or para, but due to steric hindrance, perhaps meta is favored.

So, after adding tert-butyl, the next nitration would add nitro at meta position relative to tert-butyl. So, the ring now has tert-butyl at position 1, nitro at position 3.

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But then step iv is nitrate again, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl → added to benzene.

ii) nitrate → adds nitro group, probably para to tert-butyl.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate the ring, perhaps adding a sulfonic acid group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but on what? The ring has nitro and tert-butyl groups. Diazotization usually requires an amine, not nitro.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the correct order again.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. Let's imagine that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, for the substituents to be adjacent, perhaps each substitution is directed by the previous one.

First, add the ethoxy group. It directs the next substituent to ortho or para. Suppose the next substituent is the tert-butyl, which is added ortho to ethoxy. Then, the nitro group is added ortho to tert-butyl, which would be meta to ethoxy.

But how would that work with the directing effects?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then the nitro group is added para to ethoxy, then the tert-butyl is added ortho to nitro, which would be meta to ethoxy. But I’m not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, so adding it first would make the ring less reactive for subsequent steps.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group → activating, o/p.

2. Add nitro group → which would be meta to ethoxy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in a position that allows the tert-butyl to be added in the correct spot.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the synthetic steps each option provides and see which sequence logically builds the target molecule.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl to benzene. So, benzene → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate the ring → (tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.

iii) HNO3 → nitration. Where would nitration occur? The ring has a tert-butyl (activating, meta) and a sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta). So, nitration would happen where? The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the nitro would go meta to the sulfonic acid, which is position 3.

Wait, but the ring already has tert-butyl at position 1. If sulfonic acid is added at position 2, then nitration would be at position 5 (meta to sulfonic acid). That might not fit the target. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the sulfonic acid is at position 4. After adding tert-butyl and sulfonic acid, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. Then, nitration would occur meta to the sulfonic acid, which is position 7 (but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions wrap around). Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group ends up at position 3, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the sulfonic acid in a position that's directed by the tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try another approach.

Let me think about each substituent being added.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, the substituents are:

- Ethoxy at position 1.

- tert-butyl at position 2.

- Nitro at position 3.

So, positions 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent.

Now, let's think about the order of substitution:

Possibility 1:

1. Add ethoxy (1) → benzene becomes ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl (2) → must be ortho to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro (3) → meta to tert-butyl, which is position 3.

But wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro would be added where?

Let me think about the directing effects.

After step 1: ethoxy at position 1. The ring is activated, o/p directing.

Step 2: adding tert-butyl → which would be ortho or para to ethoxy. Since the target has tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy at 1), that's possible.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2.

Step 3: Add nitro group. Where would that go? The existing substituents are ethoxy (o/p) and tert-butyl (m).

The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, where would it go?

The ethoxy directs to o/p, and the tert-butyl directs to m.

The possible positions are 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Wait, perhaps the nitro would go to position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl (position 2) and ortho to ethoxy (position 1). But ethoxy is o/p directing, so perhaps the nitro would go to position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl (position 2).

But wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added at position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl (position 2) and ortho to ethoxy (position 1). That would fit the target.

So, the sequence would be ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro.

Now, how to introduce each substituent.

Adding ethoxy first: perhaps via sulfonation and substitution.

But looking at the options, I need to find a sequence that starts with introducing ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but none of the options start with ethoxy. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A starts with tert-butyl.

Option B same.

Option C same.

Option D starts with nitration.

Hmm, so perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via substitution after some other groups are in place, perhaps after sulfonation.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Sulfonate benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Replace sulfonate group with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

3. Add tert-butyl group → via Friedel-Crafts, which requires an activated ring. Ethoxy is activating, so Friedel-Crafts can proceed.

4. Then, nitrate → nitro group added in a position directed by ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but the order would be sulfonation → substitution → alkylation → nitration.

Looking for such a sequence in the options.

Looking at option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iv) SO3.

iii) HNO3 again.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3.

iii) nitrate.

So, steps: add tert-butyl, then sulfonate, then nitrate.

But that would first add tert-butyl, then sulfonate, which may deactivate the ring, making nitration difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via substitution after sulfonating and then substituting the sulfonate group with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps in option C are:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → which is in position 4 (assuming tert-butyl is at 1).

iii) Nitrate → where? The sulfonate is deactivating, so nitro would go meta to it, perhaps at position 7 (but on benzene that's position 1, which is already occupied by tert-butyl). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrate is added at position 3, which is meta to the sulfonate group at position 4.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think about each option.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro group added.

But nitro is deactivating, making further substitution harder.

Then, ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

But Fe/HCl isn't a typical reducing agent for nitro groups. More commonly, H2/Pt or Sn/HCl is used.

Assuming it's a reduction step, after nitro group is reduced to amine, then:

iii) Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But if the ring has an amine group (from reduction), which is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would proceed. The amine is ortho/para directing.

So, adding tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amine.

But the target has tert-butyl at position 2, which would be ortho to the amine at position 1.

Then, iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But the ring now has amine and tert-butyl groups. The amine is activating, so nitration would occur ortho/para to it. But the target only has one nitro group, so this seems incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps not the right path.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. So, sulfonate the benzene ring, then substitute the sulfonate group with ethoxy.

So, steps:

1. Benzene → sulfonate → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Substitute sulfonate with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

3. Add tert-butyl → via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (AlCl3, tert-butyl chloride).

4. Add nitro group → via nitration, directed by the existing groups.

In this case, the nitro would go where the directing groups (ethoxy and tert-butyl) point. Ethoxy is o/p, tert-butyl is m.

If ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, then where would nitro go?

Nitro would prefer to be in a position that's both o/p to ethoxy and m to tert-butyl. That would be position 3, which is o to ethoxy (1) and m to tert-butyl (2).

So, the nitro would be added at position 3.

So, the steps would be: sulfonate → substitute to get ethoxy → add tert-butyl → nitrate.

Looking at the options, let's see which option follows this.

Looking for an option that has:

- Sulfonate (SO3) followed by substitution (NaOH and EtBr) to add ethoxy.

- Then, add tert-butyl via AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride.

- Then, nitrate.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3.

iii) HNO3.

No, that's adding tert-butyl first, which doesn't fit.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl.

Hmm, not matching.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iv) SO3.

iii) HNO3 again.

No.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl.

iii) tert-butyl.

No.

Wait, perhaps option A's steps are:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iv) SO3.

iii) HNO3 again.

But that may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps option C: step ii is SO3, step iii is HNO3. So, after adding tert-butyl, sulfonate, then nitrate.

But that would add nitro after the sulfonate, which is deactivating, making nitration difficult.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think about each step.

Option C's steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → ?

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → alkylation.

Wait, perhaps this is making a di-nitro compound, which isn't desired.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the sulfonate group is added.

Looking at option C, step ii is sulfonate, then step iii is nitrate. Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should instead look for the steps that result in the substituents being in the correct positions.

Another approach: The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

For the nitro to be at 3, it must be added last because it's a deactivating group, making further substitution harder. So, perhaps the last step is nitration.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy → position 1.

2. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

3. Add nitro → position 3.

So, looking for an option where nitration is the last step, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Looking at the options:

Option D's last step is NaOH/EtBr, which is alkylation, not nitration.

Option B's last step is NaOH/EtBr.

Option A's last step is NaOH/EtBr.

Option C's last step is NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, none of the options have nitration as the last step. So, perhaps the nitro is introduced earlier.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But in that case, the nitration would be the last step.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D has nitration as step iv, before other steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, where after adding tert-butyl and sulfonate, nitration is done, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Sulfonate benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Substitute sulfonate with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

3. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → at position 2.

4. Nitrate → at position 3.

Looking for an option that includes sulfonate, substitution, AlCl3 with tert-butyl chloride, and nitrate.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3.

iii) HNO3.

So, after adding tert-butyl and sulfonate, nitrate is added. But in that case, the sulfonate is a strong deactivating group, which would hinder nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of substituents and which steps introduce them.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has an ethoxy group, which is an ether. To introduce an ether group, perhaps it's done via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a good leaving group, such as a sulfonic acid group.

So, the steps could be:

1. Sulfonate benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

3. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → since the ring is activated by ethoxy, the Friedel-Crafts can proceed, adding tert-butyl ortho or para to ethoxy.

4. Nitrate the ring → adds nitro group, directed by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

So, the nitro would go to position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

Looking for an option that includes these steps.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option C does this:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

But that would add sulfonate after tert-butyl, which is activating, so sulfonation would be easier.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C are:

i) Add tert-butyl → benzene becomes tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Sulfonate → adds a sulfonic acid group. So the ring now has tert-butyl and sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate → where would nitro go? The sulfonate is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the nitro would go meta to sulfonate, which would be position 4 if sulfonate is at position 2.

But the target has nitro at position 3.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the sulfonate.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add nitro group.

2. Sulfonate.

3. Substitute sulfonate with ethoxy.

4. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But that's speculative.

Another plan: the target molecule has three substituents. So, the correct option must have steps that introduce each substituent in the right order.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitrate again.

Hmm, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps option A:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → which adds nitro group para to tert-butyl.

iii) Sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, perhaps to form a phenol.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate again.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute to get ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Because after adding tert-butyl and sulfonate, then nitrating would add nitro in a position directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of introducing groups considering their directing effects.

Since nitro is a meta director, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

But then, the ethoxy directs ortho/para, and the nitro would direct meta.

Wait, let's see:

1. Add ethoxy → benzene becomes ethoxybenzene.

2. Nitrate → adds nitro group meta to ethoxy (position 3).

3. Add tert-butyl → via Friedel-Crafts, which would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para). So, tert-butyl would go para to ethoxy (position 4) or ortho (position 2).

But the target has tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy at 1).

So, after steps 1 and 2, we have substituents at 1 (ethoxy) and 3 (nitro). Then, add tert-butyl, which would go ortho to ethoxy (position 2) or para (position 4).

If tert-butyl is added at position 2, that would be adjacent to ethoxy (1) and nitro (3), which fits the target.

So, the steps would be: ethoxy → nitro → tert-butyl.

Now, how to introduce each group.

Ethoxy → via substitution after sulfonate.

Nitro → via nitration.

tert-butyl → via Friedel-Crafts.

Looking for an option that has these steps.

Looking at option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iv) SO3.

So, that's adding tert-butyl first, which doesn't fit.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

Then, steps that might involve substitution.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3.

iii) nitrate.

No, that's adding nitro after sulfonate.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl.

iii) tert-butyl.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Sulfonate benzene → benzenesulfonic acid.

2. Substitute sulfonate with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

3. Nitrate → adds nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy at 1).

4. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

Looking for an option that includes sulfonate, substitution, nitrate, and then Friedel-Crafts.

Looking at option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

No, that's not the order I need.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think:

Option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds SO3 group.

iii) Nitrate → adds nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitrate again.

Hmm, too many steps, and perhaps not the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitrate again.

But no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Wait, after all this, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure and the need to have the nitro group added last, perhaps the correct option is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in an order that ensures proper directing effects and avoids steric hindrance. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. These substituents are adjacent to each other, which suggests that their positions are determined by the directing effects of the previously introduced groups.

### Key Analysis of the Substituents:
1. **Ethoxy Group (OCH2CH3)**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group. It should ideally be introduced early to facilitate subsequent substitutions.
2. **Tert-Butyl Group**: A bulky, activating, but meta-directing group. Its steric hindrance makes it difficult to place ortho to other substituents.
3. **Nitro Group (NO2)**: A strong deactivating, meta-directing group. It is challenging to introduce after other substituents due to its deactivating nature.

### Correct Order of Substitution:
1. **Add Ethoxy Group**: This activates the ring and directs subsequent substituents to ortho or para positions.
2. **Add Tert-Butyl Group**: This should be placed ortho to the ethoxy group, utilizing the ethoxy group's directing effect.
3. **Add Nitro Group**: This should be introduced last, as it is deactivating. It will be directed to the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group and ortho to the ethoxy group.

### Evaluation of the Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Steps include tert-butyl addition, nitration, sulfonation, and others. However, the sequence does not align with the required order of introducing the ethoxy group first or properly directing the nitro group. This option is inconsistent with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
- Similar to Option A, this sequence starts with tert-butyl addition and includes multiple nitrations and reductions. It fails to address the proper introduction of the ethoxy group and the correct placement of the nitro group.

#### **Option C**:
- This sequence starts with tert-butyl addition, followed by sulfonation and nitration. While it introduces the tert-butyl group early, it does not clearly account for the ethoxy group's introduction or the proper directing effects for the nitro group. This option also includes multiple nitrations, which is inconsistent with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
- Begins with nitration, which introduces a deactivating nitro group early. This makes subsequent substitutions difficult and does not align with the required order of introducing the ethoxy group first. This option is not suitable.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, **Option C** is the most plausible sequence, as it includes steps that could potentially lead to the correct substitution pattern. However, the sequence is not ideal and does not fully align with the required order of reactions. Despite this, it is the closest match compared to the other options.
