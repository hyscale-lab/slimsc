Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about the Lagrangian density and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in the context of quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constant is important to determine whether a theory is renormalizable. So the question is asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I think the general approach is to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (because when you integrate over four dimensions, the action has to be dimensionless, so the Lagrangian density must have dimensions of mass^4), each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 as well.

So let's break down L_int:

Each ψ (the Dirac spinor) has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ has to have dimension 4 (since it's part of the kinetic term in the Lagrangian), so ψ must be dimension 3/2.

Then, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator would be dimensionless too. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength F is defined as ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, where A is the gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1, because the field tensor F has dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1, and F is made of derivatives of A). Wait, no: the derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so each term in F is like ∂A, which is dim(∂) + dim(A) = 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Putting it all together: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimensions. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ would be 3. Then σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. Multiply by F, which is 2: 3 + 2 =5. Then the whole term is κ times that, so κ must have a dimension that makes the entire term 4 because the Lagrangian density has dimension 4. So 5 + dim(κ) =4 → dim(κ)= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would point to options A or C. 

Now, about renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≤ 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is that the dimension of the coupling constant must be such that when you add the dimensions from the fields and the coupling, the term is dimension 4. Alternatively, the coupling's dimension is 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). Wait, no, let me think again.

In general, the mass dimension of the coupling is given by [coupling] = d - (sum of fields' dimensions). For a renormalizable interaction, the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because, if the dimension is negative, the coupling becomes more relevant at lower energies, leading to Landau poles and non-renormalizable theories.

Wait, the rule is that for a term in the Lagrangian with n fields, the coupling's dimension is [g] = d - (sum of fields' dimensions). For 4 dimensions, d=4. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

In 4 dimensions, each field's dimension is determined by the requirement that the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So for a term like ψ̄ ψ, which is in the Dirac Lagrangian, each ψ is 3/2, so 3/2 + 3/2 =3. So the coupling for ψ̄ ψ (like in a mass term) would be [κ_mass] = 4 -3 =1. That's positive, so it's renormalizable.

In our problem, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. The sum of the fields' dimensions is:

ψ̄ (3/2) + ψ (3/2) + F (2) → 3/2 +3/2 +2= 8/2 +2= 4 +2? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the fields are ψ̄, ψ, and F. So each ψ is 3/2, so together 3, and F is 2. So sum is 3 +2=5. So the coupling κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]=-1.

So, for the term to be renormalizable, the coupling should have a dimension ≥0, right? Because if the dimension is negative, the term is super-renormalizable but wait, no, super-renormalizable theories have couplings with positive dimensions. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the general rule is that for a term in the Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling must be greater than or equal to the number of fields minus 4. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of superficial degree of divergence.

Alternatively, the renormalizability condition is that the coupling's dimension is non-negative. Because if [g] is positive, the interaction becomes less relevant at higher energies (since higher dimension terms are more suppressed), but I think that's the opposite. Wait, no, when a coupling has a positive mass dimension, it's a relevant operator. Wait, no, the dimension of the coupling tells us about its scaling. If the coupling has dimension [g] = 4 - (sum of fields), and for a renormalizable theory, sum of fields' dimensions must be ≤4. So 4 - sum >=0 → sum <=4.

In our case, the sum is 5, so [g] =-1. So the coupling has negative dimension. Which implies the interaction term has a dimension of 4 (the Lagrangian) as 5 + (-1)=4. So the term is renormalizable if the coupling has a dimension ≥0, but here it's negative. So this suggests that the interaction term is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait: no. The term is in the Lagrangian, and each term must have dimension 4. So the coupling's dimension is adjusted so that the term has dimension 4. So for, say, a term like ψ̄ ψ F^{μν} (or something else), the sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2=5, so the coupling must have dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4.

Now, for renormalizability, the interaction term must have a coupling with dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, that implies that the interaction becomes more significant at lower energies, meaning that perturbation theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

So in this case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The field $\psi$ is a Dirac spinor with mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, and its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension. The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$. Since $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, it is also dimensionless.

The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ to ensure the action is dimensionless. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$ (from $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$), and multiplying by $F^{\mu\nu}$ (dimension $2$) gives a total dimension of $5$. To make the entire term dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must have mass dimension $-1$:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

For a theory to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling constant must satisfy $[\kappa]_M \geq 0$. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable. This is because a negative mass dimension implies the interaction becomes more significant at lower energies, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to maintain consistency.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.**
