Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the details correctly.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times Star_2's. That's the same factor for both radius and mass. Interesting. Now, the question mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I think that relates to the peak emission wavelength of a black body, which is given by Wien's Law. Then, the radial velocities are given—Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. 

The question is asking about the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I'm guessing it's a factor of about 2.2 or something similar.

Wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity formula for a star as a black body comes into play. I remember that the luminosity L of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not necessarily the case. Because the stars might have different temperatures but due to their velocities, their observed wavelengths are shifted. Oh, right! Because the stars have a radial velocity, their spectra are Doppler shifted. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is moving towards us or away? Wait, radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. Oh, the problem doesn't specify direction, just radial velocity. So if Star_2 is moving towards or away, the observed wavelength would change.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. So for each star, their emitted λ_max would be shifted due to their velocity.

So for Star_1, v1 is 0, so no shift. So its observed λ_max is just λ1 = b / T1. For Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me think about whether it's moving towards or away. If it's moving towards us, the observed λ would be shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift). But the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both. So let me model this.

Let me denote the rest frame λ_max for each star as λ1 and λ2. But because of their velocities, the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_obs. 

The formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) 

Wait, I think the exact formula depends on whether the velocity is towards or away. Oh wait, the general Doppler formula when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) 

But wait, I think the formula is (1 + v/c) for recession, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me get it right. If the source is moving away (positive v), the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). If it's moving towards, v is negative, and the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift). 

In this problem, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, which has zero velocity, I need to find out what Star_2's velocity implies about its emitted λ_max.

Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0)
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) ) )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ_obs, 

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But λ_rest for each star is given by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Alternatively, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the observed λ_max for both stars as the same. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ.

But λ1_obs = λ1_rest, because Star_1's velocity is zero. So λ1_rest = λ. 

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ2_rest = b / T2. Similarly, λ1_rest = b / T1 = λ.

So,

λ = (b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Hmm, but I don't know if that's necessary yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find T2 in terms of T1.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the temperatures. Since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, which has no velocity, but Star_2 has a velocity. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its λ_max would be blueshifted, meaning its rest frame λ_max is longer (so it's hotter). Wait, because λ_max is shorter when the temperature is higher. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is shorter than its rest frame. So in order for the observed λ_max to match Star_1's, which is at its rest frame, Star_2's rest frame λ_max must be redshifted or blueshifted? Let me think.

Let me think of a scenario. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us. Then, its emitted λ_max (λ2) would be observed as λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). Because when moving towards, observed wavelength is shorter. So if λ2_obs is equal to λ1_rest, which is λ1. So,

λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ1 = b / T1, and λ2 = b / T2. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, that's the same as before. So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if it's moving towards or away. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max would be longer, which would require a lower temperature in its rest frame. But in the problem statement, it's given that the observed λ_max is same as Star_1.

So let's compute the Doppler shift factor. 

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s: 700,000 m/s.

But the speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 m/s is about 0.002333 c (since c ≈ 3e8 m/s, 7e5 /3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333, wait, 700,000 is 0.7e6, and c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.7e6 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333, so 2.333% of c.

So v2/c ≈ 0.02333.

So the Doppler factor sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) can be computed. But wait, I need to know whether Star_2 is moving towards or away. The problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Hmm, maybe that's a detail I've overlooked.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So let's think that Star_1 is at rest, and Star_2 is moving either towards or away, but the observed λ_max is same.

So let's assume that Star_2 is moving towards us. Then, its observed λ_max would be blueshifted. So since Star_1's λ_max is λ_rest, Star_2's observed λ_max would be λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). For them to be equal, Star_2's observed λ_max must equal Star_1's. So:

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = λ_rest_1.

But λ_rest_1 = λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1.

So, λ_rest_2 = λ_obs_1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the temperatures.

Alternatively, let's forget the Doppler shift for a moment. Let's think about the luminosity. The luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4. So for each star, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

We need to find L1/L2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So the question is, what is (T1/T2)^4? If we can find T1/T2, we can compute the luminosity ratio.

From the problem, since the observed λ_max is same for both stars, and considering Doppler shift, what can we say about T1 and T2?

Let me go back to the Doppler shift equation. Let me rephrase the situation.

For Star_1, no velocity, so λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, moving with velocity v, so λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive if moving away (redshift), negative if moving toward (blueshift).

But in the problem, λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2) = 1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is same as the Doppler factor.

Wait, so when v is positive (moving away), (1 + v/c) > (1 - v/c), so the ratio is greater than 1, so T1 > T2. So if Star_2 is moving away from us, it's rest temperature would be lower than Star_1, but the observed λ_max is same.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us (v is negative), then (1 + v/c) would be less than (1 - v/c), so the ratio sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) would be less than 1, making T1 smaller than T2. But wait, in that case, Star_2 would have a higher temperature. Hmm, but then the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, which is at rest.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us (v is positive in our frame, but since it's moving towards, it would actually have a negative velocity in the Doppler formula. Wait, maybe I should clarify the sign conventions.

Typically, the Doppler factor is written as sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) where v is positive if moving away (redshift), negative if moving towards (blueshift). So if Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative, so the factor becomes sqrt( (1 - |v|/c ) / (1 + |v|/c ) ) which is less than 1. So the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength.

But the observed λ_max is same as Star_1. So let's set up the equation again.

For Star_2, observed λ_max = λ_max2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = same as Star_1's λ_max = λ_max1_rest.

So,

λ_max1_rest = λ_max2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_max1_rest = b / T1, and λ_max2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, T2 is less than T1 if v is positive (Star_2 moving away), and greater than T1 if v is negative (Star_2 moving towards). 

But in this problem, v_2 is given as 700 km/s, but the direction isn't specified. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the radial velocity given is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. But the problem just says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So, without knowing the direction, but considering that we have to compute the luminosity, perhaps we can proceed with the magnitude.

Wait, but the Doppler shift depends on direction. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest frame, which would require that its rest frame λ_max is shorter (because observed is same as Star_1). So λ_max2_rest < λ_max1_rest, meaning T2 > T1 because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Wait, wait, no: λ_max = b/T, so if λ_max2_rest < λ_max1_rest, then T2 > T1.

Wait, no, because if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_max is longer than its rest frame. So for Star_2's observed λ_max to be same as Star_1's, Star_2's rest λ_max must be shorter. Because when moving away, observed λ_max is longer than rest.

So,

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

If v is positive (moving away), then λ_obs_2 > λ_rest_2.

And since λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_1,

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_rest_1 = b/T1, λ_rest_2 = b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

=> T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, but v is positive (moving away), so (1 - v/c) is less than (1 + v/c). So sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) is less than 1. So T2 is less than T1.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest frame. So to have λ_obs_2 = λ_obs_1 (same as Star_1's rest frame), Star_2's rest frame must have a shorter λ_max, which implies higher temperature.

So, Star_2's rest frame λ_max is shorter than Star_1's, so T2 is higher than T1.

But from the equation above, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So if v is positive, moving away, then (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is less than 1, so sqrt(...) is less than 1, which would make T2 less than T1. But that contradicts our previous conclusion.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me take it step by step.

If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_max is longer than Star_2's rest frame. So for Star_2's observed λ_max to be the same as Star_1's (which has no velocity), Star_2 must have a rest frame λ_max that's shorter than Star_1's. Because when moving away, λ_obs is longer; so λ_obs_2 = λ_obs_1 implies λ_rest_2 < λ_obs_1. 

Since λ_rest_2 = b / T2, and λ_obs_1 = b / T1.

So,

b/T2 < b/T1 → T2 > T1.

So, T2 is larger than T1.

But according to the equation earlier, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So for T2 > T1, the sqrt term must be greater than 1.

Which implies,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) > 1

Multiply both sides by (1 + v/c) (positive, since v < c).

1 - v/c > 1 + v/c → -v/c > v/c → -2v/c > 0 → which is impossible because v is positive.

So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that Star_2 is moving away must be wrong.

Wait, that suggests that Star_2 must be moving towards us. Let's try that.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative (since moving towards). Let's say v = -700 km/s.

Then,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But v is negative, so:

v/c = -700,000 / 3e8 ≈ -0.002333.

So,

(1 - (-0.002333)) = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333

(1 + (-0.002333)) = 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667

So,

sqrt( (1.002333) / (0.997667) ) ≈ sqrt(1.004669) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So, T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Which aligns with our earlier conclusion that T2 must be higher than T1 because Star_2's rest frame λ_max is shorter (so higher T) and when moving towards, the observed λ_max is shorter than rest frame. But since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, which is at rest, we have:

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But v is negative, so sqrt( (1 + |v|/c)/(1 - |v|/c) )

Wait, perhaps better to compute the actual number.

v = 700 km/s, moving towards us. So v is negative, but let me take its magnitude for the Doppler formula.

So the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity. Wait, no, when the source is moving towards the observer, the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), which is a blueshift.

So, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_1.

So,

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_rest_1 = b/T1, λ_rest_2 = b/T2.

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

→ T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Because when v is negative (moving towards), the Doppler factor becomes:

sqrt( (1 + (-v)/c)/(1 - (-v)/c) ) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps it's better to just compute the ratio T2/T1.

Let me compute (1 + v/c) and (1 - v/c), but using v as a positive number since it's the speed.

Wait, v = 700 km/s. Let me compute the Doppler factor.

v = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 ≈ 0.00233333.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023333

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976667

So,

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.00467.

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So, T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

Now, going back to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5 → squared is 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (1 / 1.00233)^4.

Let me compute 1/1.00233 ≈ 0.99767.

Raising that to the 4th power: (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99767^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534.

Then, square that again: (0.99534)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

So approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, let me be more precise with the calculation of (1 / 1.00233)^4.

Compute 1.00233:

1.00233 ≈ 1 + 0.00233.

Compute 1/1.00233 ≈ 0.997669.

Now, (0.997669)^4.

Compute 0.997669^2 = approx (1 - 0.002331)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002331 + (0.002331)^2 ≈ 0.995338 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995343.

Then, 0.995343^2 = (1 - 0.004657)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004657 + (0.004657)^2 ≈ 0.990685 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.990706.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990706.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990706 ≈ 2.2284.

Approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity and the Doppler effect for wavelength shifts.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed wavelengths at maximum brightness: \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \) are the same for both stars.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the effective temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]

3. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   The wavelength of maximum emission is related to temperature by Wien's law:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted due to its radial velocity:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} = b / T \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Radial Velocity**:
   The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Converting \( v_2 \) to SI units:
   \[
   v_2 = 700,000 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700,000}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
   \]

2. **Temperature Ratio**:
   Using the Doppler shift formula:
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx \sqrt{1.00467} \approx 1.00233
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting into the luminosity formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]
   Given \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \), we have:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = 2.25
   \]
   For the temperature ratio:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
   \]
   Approximating \( (0.99767)^4 \):
   \[
   (0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad (0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx 0.9907
   \]
   Combining the results:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.228
   \]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

**Answer: D**
