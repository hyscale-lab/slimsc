Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Hmm. Let me start by breaking down what the question says.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. To get a good image, he needs an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps to achieve this, but some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them.

So, Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature influence this. But when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed something odd: the mean free path changed to λ2, even though the temperature stayed the same.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Let me think about what the mean free path depends on. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the effective diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. But wait, pressure is related to the number density. Alternatively, another version is λ = (1) / (sqrt(2) * π * n * d^2), where n is the number density.

Wait, another way to write it is λ = (1) / (n * π * d²) multiplied by some factors, but the key is that λ depends on the density of the gas and the size of the molecules. So, if the temperature is the same, and the pressure is the same, why would the mean free path change?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, it's producing a high-energy electron flux. Those electrons can interact with the gas molecules. High-energy electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or even eject from the system. So, if the gas molecules are being ionized, they might become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum can get attracted to the electron beam or other parts of the microscope, right? Or maybe they get accelerated by the electric fields in the electron beam.

Wait, but wait. In a vacuum, if the gas molecules are neutral, their mean free path is determined by their collisions. But if the electron beam is causing these molecules to ionize, then the ions might behave differently. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to get pumped out more efficiently, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so maybe the pressure isn't changing.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but that's about the electron's path, not the gas molecules' movement. Wait, no—the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. So maybe when the beam is on, the gas molecules are moving differently. Or perhaps the beam is causing the gas to heat up slightly, but the temperature is the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path of the gas molecules is about how far they go before colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are scattering the gas molecules, which would affect the electrons' path, not the gas molecules'. Hmm, but the question is about the gas's mean free path, so maybe it's not about scattering the electrons but the gas moving around.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it's creating an electric field or some other effect that affects the motion of the gas molecules. For example, in a strong electric field, charged particles (if ionized) would experience a force. But if the gas remains neutral, then maybe the mean free path isn't affected by the beam.

Alternatively, maybe when the beam is on, it heats the gas molecules, increasing their temperature. But the question states that the temperature remained the same, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas to be ionized. If the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles in the vacuum might be more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber or get accelerated into the walls, thus reducing their mean free path. Because if they stick to the walls, the effective concentration of gas molecules in the chamber decreases. Wait, but the pressure is already under 1e-9 Torr. If some of the gas is being removed, that would lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. Because lower pressure (lower n) means λ is higher. So, wait, in the initial state, λ1 is the mean free path when the gas is neutral and at certain pressure. When the beam is on, if the gas is ionized and some of them are being removed, the pressure would effectively decrease. So that would mean the mean free path increases, so λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the question says that after starting the electron beam, the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2, and the temperature remained the same. So the factors affecting λ are the same, except perhaps the presence of the beam.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is determined by the interactions between gas molecules. If the gas molecules are being ionized, perhaps they're more likely to stick to the walls because ions can be attracted to the walls which are possibly charged or have a potential. So the number density in the chamber decreases because some gas particles are getting stuck to the walls, which is a process called wall loss. So the effective pressure would decrease, meaning the mean free path increases because λ is inversely proportional to pressure (since P is proportional to n). So if the effective pressure is lower, λ would be higher than before. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the mean free path would increase.

Wait, but Mike calculated λ1 based on the initial conditions. So if the gas is being lost from the chamber because it's being ionized and stuck to the walls, the actual pressure is lower than what was initially thought. So the mean free path is longer. So λ2 > λ1.

But wait, in the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the opposite. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So if the mean free path increased, then λ2 is larger than λ1. So the correct option would be A, perhaps, if the factor is 1.22 times.

But wait, why 1.22? Hmm. Oh, wait, the mean free path when considering the effect of a beam could involve something else. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more mobile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the electron beam is on, the chamber's walls get heated, causing the gas to expand or change its properties. But the question says the temperature is the same, so that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be more likely to scatter off the walls. Because if the beam imparts energy, the walls might have a higher temperature, but again, the overall temperature of the system is the same.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam induces a static electric field in the chamber. If the gas molecules are charged, this field would influence their motion. For example, ions would be drawn towards the electron beam's source or other charged areas. This would effectively reduce the number of ions in the chamber because some are being pulled towards the walls or other parts, leading to a lower effective pressure and hence a longer mean free path.

But wait, why would the mean free path increase? Because if the number density of gas molecules decreases (because some are being removed or stuck), then the mean free path increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So for the options, A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, which would be the case if the mean free path increased by that factor. But why 1.22? That number is familiar... Oh, wait, sometimes in physics, factors like sqrt(2) or other square roots come into play. Alternatively, 1.22 is approximately 4/π, which is about 1.27, close to 1.22. Not sure, but perhaps it's a factor from some other equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial λ1 was calculated assuming the gas is in thermal equilibrium, but when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes non-thermal, but I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path is calculated based on the assumption that the gas is at a certain pressure. If the electron beam causes some of the gas to be removed (because they're ionized and then pumped away by the vacuum system), the effective pressure would decrease. So the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So looking back at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option C is λ2<λ1. So if λ2 is bigger, the correct answer would be either A or D.

Wait, but the options don't specify exactly by how much. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2. So if the mean free path increases, then λ2 must be larger than λ1. So looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, and option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1. So the question is whether λ2 is larger than λ1 but not necessarily by 1.22 times.

Wait, why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times? Or is that not the case? Perhaps the mean free path depends on the square root of the pressure. Let me think. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure times the square root of the molecular mass or something else? Wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where d is the mean diameter. So if pressure P decreases, λ increases. So if the pressure drops, the mean free path increases.

But how does the presence of the electron beam affect the pressure? Well, if the beam causes some gas molecules to be pumped out, the pressure would decrease. So λ increases as P decreases.

But the question says that Mike found that the mean free path was λ2, but the temperature remained the same. So with same T and same P, λ would be same. But in reality, the pressure might have changed, but Mike's measurement didn't account for that.

Wait, but Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the initial conditions. So if the pressure changed, perhaps his initial calculation was based on the wrong assumption. Or maybe when the beam is on, the pressure isn't the same anymore because some gas is being removed.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized and then get attracted to the walls, effectively reducing the pressure. So the effective pressure is lower than before, leading to a longer mean free path.

So in that case, the mean free path would increase. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

So the options are A, C, etc. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the answer should be either A or D.

Wait, but the options are: A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, B) λ2=λ1, C) λ2 < λ1, D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

So if the mean free path increases, the options A and D are possibilities.

But wait, why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times? That seems specific. Maybe the factor 1.22 comes from some other consideration.

Wait, wait—the mean free path in the presence of an electron beam might be affected by electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering the gas molecules, which could affect the mean free path for the gas. But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules, not the electrons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to have a different effective diameter. For example, if the gas is ionized, maybe the effective diameter changes because the ions have a different charge state, but that's a stretch.

Wait another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to collide with the electron beam's trajectory, but that would affect the electrons, not the gas's mean free path. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules ionize and become charged, which increases their cross-sectional area for collisions. Wait, but that would make the mean free path shorter, because the cross-section is larger (d increases). But if d increases, λ = 1/(n π d²) would decrease. So λ would get smaller, meaning λ2 < λ1. But that contradicts with the earlier thought.

Wait, maybe I should think about the effect of ionization on the mean free path. Neutral gas molecules have a certain collision cross-section. When they become ions, their cross-section might be larger if they carry a charge because they can interact with the electric fields in the system. So charged particles might have a larger effective diameter for the purpose of collisions. That would make λ smaller, as λ is inversely proportional to d squared.

So if the mean free path is λ = 1/(n π d²), and if d increases because the gas is ionized, then λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the gas is being lost from the chamber, leading to lower pressure and higher λ. So which effect is stronger?

Hmm, perhaps the ionization leads to more gas sticking to the walls, which reduces the number density, increasing λ. But if the ionization also increases d (effective diameter), that would decrease λ. So which effect dominates?

If the number density drops, λ increases, but if d increases, λ decreases. So which effect is more significant?

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the number density decreases because ionized gas molecules are being pumped out more efficiently, leading to a lower pressure and hence higher λ. Because if the pressure is lower, n is lower, so λ = 1/(n π d²) increases.

But if the number of particles is the same (n is same), but d increases, λ would decrease.

So in this scenario, Mike's setup initially had n producing λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps some gas is being lost, so n decreases. So the new λ is based on lower n, making λ2 larger.

So in that case, λ2 > λ1, so the correct answer would be A or D.

But the options don't give a specific factor, so perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so A or D.

But the question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

So since the electron beam causes some gas to be pumped out or stick to the walls, the pressure in the chamber decreases, which implies a longer mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

So looking at the options, A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, which would mean a significant increase. But why 1.22?

Wait, maybe the mean free path calculation in the presence of the beam accounts for some factor. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to have a higher effective temperature, but the problem states the temperature is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ionized particles' mean free path is shorter. Wait, but that doesn't align with earlier thoughts.

Wait, perhaps the effect is that the gas is more likely to collide with the walls because the ionized particles are attracted to the walls. Thus, the mean free path is shorter because the gas molecules are more likely to hit the walls and not other gas molecules. Wait, that might decrease the mean free path for the gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the mean free path for gas molecules is the average distance between collisions with other gas molecules. If the gas particles are more likely to hit the walls instead of each other due to being ionized and accelerated towards the walls, then the mean free path for gas-gas collisions would be longer because the gas particles are sticking to the walls and not colliding with each other as often. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path for collisions between gas molecules increases because the gas is less dense due to loss, but the mean free path for electron-gas scattering is something else. Wait, but the question is specifically about the gas's mean free path.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:

- Initially, the mean free path is λ1.

- After turning on the beam, some gas might be lost, leading to lower pressure. Lower pressure implies higher mean free path (λ2 > λ1).

- Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, it might have a different effective diameter, making λ2 smaller.

But which effect is more significant? If the pressure drops enough, even a small change in n could lead to a significant change in λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to n, so even a small decrease in n could lead to a large increase in λ.

So if the presence of the beam causes a significant drop in n, then λ2 could be much larger than λ1. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Looking back at the options, the only option that says λ2 is greater than λ1 is option A and D. Option A says λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1. Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 times.

But why would the mean free path increase exactly 1.22 times? Or does that factor come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions are being extracted or pumped out more efficiently. If the ion pump is more effective, the pressure drops, increasing the mean free path.

But without knowing the exact factor, can we conclude that λ2 is greater than λ1? If so, then the answer would be either A or D.

But the question is, what can we conclude about λ2? Because the options don't specify exactly how much, perhaps the options are suggesting that λ2 is less than λ1, which would be the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the physics again. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n π d²). If the number density n decreases, λ increases. If the effective diameter d increases (due to ionization, perhaps), λ decreases.

So which effect is more significant? If n decreases enough, even a small increase in d would result in a net increase in λ.

But how much does n decrease? Well, Mike's vacuum is already ultra-high, so the initial n is very low. If the electron beam causes some of the gas to be lost (like pumped out or sticking to walls), n would decrease further. So the effect on n is more significant than the effect on d. Therefore, the increase in λ would dominate.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So among the options, the only ones that fit are A and D.

But the options don't say how much. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct options are A or D.

The question states that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the initial conditions. Upon starting the beam, perhaps the number of gas particles in the chamber decreased, leading to a lower pressure and higher λ2.

If the decrease in n is significant, λ2 could be much larger than λ1. So the most correct conclusion is that lambda2 is greater than lambda1. So the options are A and D.

But the question is, which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The mean free path of gas molecules in the presence of the electron beam is calculated based on electron scattering. Wait, no, the mean free path of the gas molecules is determined by their own collisions, not the electrons. So the presence of the electrons shouldn't affect the gas's mean free path except perhaps through ionization.

So if the gas is ionized, it might stick to the walls more, leading to lower n and thus higher λ. So λ2 > λ1.

Therefore, the correct option is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Looking at the options, A and D are possibilities.

But why is option A the answer? It says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. Where does 1.22 come from?

Wait, another thought. The mean free path could be influenced by the scattering of electrons off the gas molecules. But the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves is based on gas-gas collisions, not electron-gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to heat, leading to higher temperature, which would increase λ. But the question says the temperature remained the same, so that's not the case.

Another angle: the presence of the beam might increase the speed of the gas molecules, but that's unlikely because the temperature is the same.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas molecules to have a longer mean free path because they are being 'pushed' by the beam. No, because mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules, not external forces.

Hmm, I'm not sure. I think I've circled back to the initial conclusion that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the options, A and D are possible. But the question is, which one is correct.

Wait, maybe the factor 1.22 relates to the increase in mean free path due to a change in the effective diameter. Let me think, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter. So if the effective diameter d increases by a factor of x, λ decreases by x squared.

But if the pressure drops by a factor of x squared, λ would increase by x squared.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the beam leads to a change in the effective path length due to the beam's energy. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path of a gas is inversely proportional to pressure. So if the pressure in the chamber decreases when the beam is on, λ increases.

But why would the pressure decrease? Because the electron beam might cause gas molecules to be ionized, and the chamber's vacuum system (like the pumps) can remove ions more effectively than neutral gas. So the effective pressure drops. So λ increases.

Therefore, λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is either A or D.

But the options don't specify whether it's exactly 1.22 times or not. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

We can conclude that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A and D.

But looking at the options again, option D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1. So λ2 is slightly bigger. Option A says it's at least 1.22 times.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, we can't know the exact factor. So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam doesn't affect the pressure much. Or perhaps the mean free path doesn't change much. But the question says that λ2 is different.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is calculated differently when the gas is ionized. Suppose the ionized gas has a higher cross-section for collisions, which would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1. But earlier I thought that the pressure might have decreased, leading to a longer mean free path.

Which effect is more significant?

Hmm, perhaps the ionization leads to more sticking to the walls, which reduces n, thus increasing λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization makes the gas more likely to collide with the walls, thereby reducing their mean free path.

Wait, if a gas molecule is ionized, it can get attracted to the walls which are possibly charged or under a potential. So the ion would hit the wall more often, leading to more loss from the system. So the number density n would decrease, which would increase λ.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, A and D are the possibilities.

But the problem is asking what we can conclude, so perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1. But the options don't have an option that says λ2 > λ1 without a specific factor.

Wait, looking again at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, option D says it's in between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Hmm, maybe the mean free path increases, but not by a huge factor. Perhaps the electron beam doesn't cause a drastic change in pressure, so the mean free path increases slightly. So λ2 is a bit larger than λ1, but less than 1.22 times.

In that case, option D would be correct.

Wait, but without knowing the exact change, how can we conclude whether it's more or less than 1.22 times?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't significantly change the pressure, so λ2 is approximately equal to λ1. But the question states that λ2 is different.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path actually decreases because the ions have a larger effective diameter.

Wait, but the problem states that the temperature is the same, so if the pressure is the same, λ would be the same. But in reality, the pressure could be lower because some gas is lost.

So perhaps the mean free path increases. Thus, λ2 > λ1.

But given the options, the only one that says λ2 is greater than λ1 is A and D.

If the question is about what we can conclude, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, but the options don't specify by how much. So among the given options, the only ones that fit are A and D.

But since the question doesn't give more details, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the answer would be A or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the temperature, but the problem says the temperature is the same.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall: in ultra-high vacuums, the mean free path is very long. When the pressure is lowered, the mean free path increases. So if the beam causes the pressure to drop, the mean free path increases.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So if the mean free path increases by at least 22%, that's a significant increase.

But why would it be exactly that factor?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam creates a condition where the gas is effectively at a lower pressure, so λ2 is larger than λ1, but not necessarily by a specific factor.

Wait, given the options, the only one that suggests λ2 is larger is A and D.

But since the question is about what can we conclude, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the correct options are A and D.

But the options don't have a general "λ2 > λ1" option. So between A and D.

I think the intended answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves understanding the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ₁ based on the vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ₂, even though the temperature remains constant. The task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path of gas molecules is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \pi d^2}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number density of the gas, \(d\) is the effective diameter of the molecules, and \(\pi\) is a geometric factor. Thus, \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to \(n\) and \(d^2\).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, causing them to become charged. Charged particles are more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber or be removed by the vacuum system, effectively reducing the number density (\(n\)) in the chamber.
   - A lower \(n\) increases the mean free path (\(\lambda\)) because \(\lambda \propto 1/n\).

3. **Temperature and Pressure**:
   - The temperature remains constant, so the thermal motion of gas molecules does not change. However, the ionization caused by the electron beam can lead to a reduction in the effective pressure in the chamber, further increasing \(\lambda\).

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. If the electron beam causes a substantial reduction in \(n\), \(\lambda_2\) could indeed be larger than \(\lambda_1\), potentially by a factor of 1.22 or more.
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the observation that \(\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1\).
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a decrease in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the reasoning that the electron beam reduces \(n\), leading to an increase in \(\lambda\).
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a small increase in the mean free path, but it does not account for the possibility of a larger increase if \(n\) is significantly reduced.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The presence of the electron beam likely reduces the number density (\(n\)) of gas molecules, leading to an increase in the mean free path (\(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\)). Among the options, **Option A** is the most consistent with this conclusion, as it allows for a significant increase in \(\lambda_2\) relative to \(\lambda_1\).

### Final Answer:
The mean free path increases when the electron beam is turned on, and the most reasonable conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\).

**Answer: A**
