Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I'm supposed to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what do I know about complex formation? EDTA usually binds metal ions in a 1:1 ratio, right? So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2-. So the formula would be CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA^4-.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2-.

Wait, no, the K provided is the formation constant. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I'm given K_Ca-EDTA, which I think is the same as the formation constant, Kf.

But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the equilibrium. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the initial concentration of free EDTA is negligible because EDTA is usually present in excess or in a form that doesn't dissociate much. Wait, but in this case, the solution is purely the Ca-EDTA complex, so the only source of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- is the dissociation of the complex.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. Wait, no, actually, if the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, then the change would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, the problem says pH is ideal, so I think it's assuming that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-. So the dissociation is straightforward.

So the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Plugging in the values from the equilibrium:

5e10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = (0.02 - x)/(x²)

But wait, since K is so large (5e10 is a big number), the dissociation is minimal. So x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the equation.

So approximately, 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is close to option C, 6.3e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. The K is 5e10, which is very large, so the complex is very stable, meaning that the dissociation is minimal. Hence, x (the [Ca^2+]) is small, so the approximation holds.

So the concentration of Ca^2+ is sqrt( (0.02) / K ), since K = [complex]/( [Ca][EDTA] ) → [Ca] = sqrt( [complex]/K ) → sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → same as before.

Yes, so the answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{[CaEDTA]}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{[CaEDTA]}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). The equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([\text{[CaEDTA]}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Since \( K \) is very large (\( 5 \times 10^{10} \)), the dissociation is minimal, so \( x \ll 0.02 \). Approximating \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
