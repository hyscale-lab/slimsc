Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space is two-dimensional, probably a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature. Like, the tractricoid is a pseudosphere. Its metric has a specific form, and I remember that the area of a pseudosphere is finite, but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, the metric given here has a denominator (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). That suggests that the domain of x and y is limited such that 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise the metric would become imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So x² + y² must be less than 4. So the coordinates x and y live inside a circle of radius 2, since 2² is 4. Oh wait, that's interesting because the radius r is 2 here. So this might be related.

Wait, but in the context of a pseudosphere, the metric usually involves a factor that depends on the radius. Let me think. The standard metric for a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is something like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. But that's in polar coordinates, r and θ. Alternatively, in some other coordinate systems, the metric could look different.

Wait, the given metric is in terms of x and y. Let me try to see if this can be rewritten in polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that's a radial form. So in polar coordinates, the metric depends on r and θ, but the terms are in dr and r dθ, which is typical for a metric in polar coordinates.

So this looks like a metric for a surface of revolution with some function. The factor [32/(4 - r²)] is the line element for each direction. So for the area, I'll need to compute the area element. In two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ, where g is the metric tensor. The metric tensor components are g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²), and the cross terms (g_rθ and g_θr) are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) - 0 = (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, wait, the metric in polar coordinates is given by:

ds² = g_rr dr² + 2 g_rθ dr dθ + g_θθ dθ².

In our case, the cross terms are zero, so the metric in matrix form is diagonal: diag( g_rr, g_θθ ), where g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms, because it's diagonal and off-diagonal are zero. So det(g) = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, the metric tensor for polar coordinates is actually a bit different. Because in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ. But when the metric is given as ds² = a(r) dr² + b(r) dθ², the area element is sqrt(a*b) dr dθ. Because the determinant of the metric is a*b, and the area element is sqrt(det(g)) times dx dy, but in polar coordinates, it's already in terms of dr and dθ, so the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ.

Wait, let me double-check. The area element dA in two dimensions is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2) dθ dr. Since g_rθ is zero, it's sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ). So in our case, g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = [32 r²]/(4 - r²). So the product is (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2, so sqrt of that is (32 r) / (4 - r²).

So the area element is [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ. Therefore, to find the total area, we integrate this over the region of r and θ.

What are the limits of r? Since the denominator is 4 - r², it must be positive, so r² <4 → r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2. θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, the integral over θ will just multiply by 2π. So:

A = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

= 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Hmm, substitution perhaps. Let u = 4 - r²; then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 * ∫ [ - (du/2) ] / u

Wait, let me do it step by step:

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ r dr / u ] → 32 ∫ [ (- du/2 ) / u ] → -32/2 ∫ (du/u) → -16 ∫ (du/u).

The integral of du/u is ln |u| + C. So the definite integral from r=0 to r=2:

When r=0 → u=4.

When r=2 → u=0.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, u approaches zero. So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

But wait, as u approaches 0 from the positive side (since r² <4, u is positive), ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → -16*(-infty) → which is positive infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the area of a pseudosphere should be finite. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the given metric is in x and y coordinates, but perhaps the actual area is finite because the singularity at r=2 is a boundary, not a point where the metric breaks down. Let me think about the integral again.

Wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand [32 r/(4 - r²)] becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is like ∫ [something that goes to infinity] near r=2. So the integral would diverge, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. A pseudosphere has finite area. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric. Let me think about the standard pseudosphere.

The standard pseudosphere metric is usually written in terms of (r, θ) as:

ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ²,

where a is the radius. The area is 2π a^2 (e^{2r/a} -1) evaluated from r=0 to r=infinity, but wait, no, that can't be it. Wait, actually, the area of a pseudosphere is finite. The tractricoid has finite area. Let me recall: the area is 4π a², because it's analogous to the sphere's 4π r², but for a pseudosphere, which is non-compact, but wait, no, the pseudosphere is infinitely long, but the area might still be finite if the curvature is negative and the metric falls off exponentially.

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, let me think again. The standard pseudosphere has Gaussian curvature K = -1/a². The area can be calculated as the integral over the surface. Wait, but in the tractrix parametrization, the area might be finite because the surface wraps around. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe the given metric is not a pseudosphere but something else. Let's see. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, as I did earlier, it's ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, the area element is [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ, so integrating from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π. As r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [32 r]/(4 - r²) dr.

Wait, let me compute that integral again. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / u = 32 ∫ [ (- du/2) ] / u = -16 ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). So:

At r=2, u=0 → ln(0) is -infty.

At r=0, u=4 → ln(4).

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ) ] → -16*(-infinity) +16 ln4 → which is infinity. So the integral is divergent, meaning the area is infinite.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier understanding that a pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?".

Wait, but if the metric given is of a pseudosphere, but the calculation suggests the area is infinite, then the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, perhaps the radius here is different. The radius of the pseudosphere is usually a parameter a in its metric, but in this case, the denominator is 4 - r². So 4 is 2², so perhaps the radius is 2. But the integral suggests the area is infinite, so the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the area would be infinite. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the metric given is not complete. Because in the given metric, as r approaches 2, the area element approaches infinity. So the surface is only defined up to r=2, but it's a boundary, not a singularity. So the area would be finite.

Wait, but the integral from 0 to 2 would involve an improper integral, which is the limit as r approaches 2 from below. Let me compute that.

Compute the integral from 0 to 2 of 32 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr= -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) ] / u → -16 ∫ (du/u) → -16 ln|u| + C.

So the definite integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

Limit as b approaches 2 from below:

[ -16 ln(4 - b²) ] evaluated from 0 to b.

At b=2: 4 - b² approaches 0 → ln(0) approaches -infty → -16*(-infty) = +infty.

At b=0: ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ infinity - (-16 ln4) ] → infinity.

So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we first rewrite the metric in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\). Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is given by \(\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(g\) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the components of \(g\) are \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\), with no cross terms (\(g_{r\theta} = g_{\theta r} = 0\)). The determinant of \(g\) is:

\[
\det(g) = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the domain of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The radial coordinate \(r\) satisfies \(4 - r^2 > 0\), so \(r < 2\). Therefore, \(r\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\), and \(\theta\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), where \(du = -2r \, dr\), or equivalently, \(r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2}\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration gives:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \ln|u| \Big|_0^4 = 16 \ln(4) - 16 \ln(0).
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:
