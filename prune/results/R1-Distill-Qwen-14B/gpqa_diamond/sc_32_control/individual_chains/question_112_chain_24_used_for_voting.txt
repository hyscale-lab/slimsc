Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's proportional, not necessarily of unit length. That's usually the first step when dealing with quantum states.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems. So the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these two, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring each when another operator is measured. Oh, wait, no—the first part is about measuring the eigenstates of a different operator. The operator has a matrix where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and zero otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, let me get the matrix A correct. So for a 2x2 matrix (since it's spin-1/2, so two states), the elements would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, it's hbar/2; when i = j, it's zero. So this matrix looks like this:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

I think this is the operator in question. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates for which we'll measure probabilities. So the first part is: what are the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A.

Wait, but operator A is a 2x2 matrix. So I need to find its eigenstates. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared moduli of the components of the state in the eigenstate basis.

So step 1: normalize |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm. The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Calculating each term:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1=2
|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5
So total norm squared is 2 + 5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, find the eigenstates of operator A. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates without diagonalizing, but maybe it's easier to diagonalize A.

Wait, operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.
So determinant of [[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]] = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = (hbar²)/4 => λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> = 0

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 , -hbar/2 ]

The equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form v1 [1; 1], but we can normalize them. Wait, but let me check the equations again.

Wait, actually, let's take the equations from the matrix. So:

Row 1: (-λ) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → for λ=hbar/2, this becomes (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

Similarly, row 2: (hbar/2) v1 - (hbar/2) v2 =0 → same as row 1. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]

Equation becomes (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, -1]^T.

Now, these are the eigenstates of A. Let's call them |+> and |->, where |+> is [1;1], and |-> is [1;-1].

But wait, these aren't normalized yet. Let's normalize them.

For |+>:

The vector is [1;1]. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 1].

Similarly, |-> is [1; -1], which has norm sqrt(2), so normalized to (1/sqrt(2)) [1; -1].

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of the basis vectors. Let me think. The state |+> is [1,1]^T divided by sqrt(2), which corresponds to (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly for |->.

So now, the state |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. But we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->, and then the probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the coefficients.

Yes, that's the correct approach. So first, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Our goal is to find c_+ and c_-, then the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Wait, but wait—since |+> and |-> are orthonormal, the coefficients can be found by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So let's compute c_+ = < + | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha >.

But our |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so let's compute those inner products.

First, let me write |alpha> normalized as ( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ) / sqrt(7). Because earlier we found the norm is sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < + | alpha > is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2-i) <up|down> + (2-i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1. The cross terms <down|up> and <up|down> are zero because they are orthonormal.

So this simplifies to (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 ]

Wait, no: wait, let's redo the calculation.

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Because <up|down> is zero. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Let me compute < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Wait, no. Because the |alpha> is expressed as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, and |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Because when you take the inner product, each term is the coefficient of |up> times <up|+> and coefficient of |down> times <down|+>.

Wait, <up|+> is (1/sqrt(2)), and <down|+> is (1/sqrt(2)). So:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Simplify numerator: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So this becomes 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, that's 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_- = < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i - (2 -i)) / sqrt(7) ]

Simplify numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So this becomes [ (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ].

So now, we have:

c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)),

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait—hold on. Let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, for < + | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <up|up> + (2 -i) * <down|up> ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <up|down> + (2 -i) * <down|down> ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Because |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < + | alpha > is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * <up|+> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * <down|+>

Which is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]*(1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]*(1/sqrt(2)).

So that's [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Which is (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, < - | alpha > is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]*(1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]*(-1/sqrt(2)).

Because <down|-> = -1/sqrt(2).

So numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Which is approximately 0.64. Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which sums to 1. So that's a possibility.

Compute |c_-|^2: the numerator is (-1 +2i), so the modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2 =5/(14) ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which adds up to 14/14=1.

So the first part of the problem: the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Well, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is closer to 0.36, but let's compute exactly.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.3571, so the options are either 0.36 or 0.28, etc.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, which adds to 1.0, yes.

Now, moving on to the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's real and symmetric in this case), the average value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Alternatively, I can compute it directly.

But maybe using eigenvalues would be easier. Since |+> and |-> are the eigenstates, and probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively, the average would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Which is [ (9-5)hbar/(28) ] = (4 hbar )/(28 )= hbar/(7).

Wait, that's a possibility. Option A's average is hbar/7.

So putting it together: probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.357, which is ~0.36), and average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that would match.

Wait, but wait, looking again at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When I calculated c_+, I got 3/sqrt(14), so |c_+|^2 is 9/14, which is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So option A matches.

But let me double-check the average value calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

First, let's express A in the |up> and |down> basis.

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So as a matrix, it's:

[ 0, hbar/2
 hbar/2, 0 ]

So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Compute A|alpha> first:

A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the dot product of <alpha| and A|alpha>.

So:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Factor out (hbar/2) / (7):

= (hbar/2) [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) ] / 7.

Compute each term:

(1+i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i)
= 2 -i +2i -i^2
= 2 +i +1 (since i^2=-1)
=3 +i.

Similarly, (2 -i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2i -i*1 -i^2
= 2 +2i -i +1
=3 + i.

So each term is (3 +i), so sum is 2*(3+i) =6 + 2i.

So,

= (hbar/2) (6 +2i) /7.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because both terms are (3+i), so sum is 2*(3+i) =6 +2i.

So,

= (hbar/2) * (6 +2i) /7 = (hbar/2) * 2*(3 +i)/7 = (hbar) * (3 +i)/7.

Wait, but wait a minute, the average value must be real because A is Hermitian. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Ah, wait, because when I compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's a real number because A is Hermitian.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the matrix multiplication.

A|alpha> is:

First component: A[0][0] * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + A[0][1] * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= 0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2) (2 -i) / sqrt(7)

Second component: A[1][0] * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + A[1][1] * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

So A|alpha> is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ], because the complex conjugate of |alpha>.

So the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) * (hbar/2) /7.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + (-i)(1) - i*(2) + i^2*(-1)
Wait, actually,

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 =-1)
=1-3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So putting it all together:

First term: (1-3i) * (hbar/2) /7.
Second term: (1+3i) * (hbar/2) /7.

Adding them:

(1 -3i +1 +3i) * (hbar/2)/7 = (2) * (hbar/2) /7 = (hbar) /7.

Ah, so the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\text{Norm} = \sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we compute the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \), which are the overlaps of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), respectively. These are given by:

\[
c_+ = \langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P_+ = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P_- = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Expanding \( A|\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1+i \\
2-i
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix}
2-i \\
1+i
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \) is then:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right).
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1-3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1+3i,
\]
\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} (1-3i + 1+3i) = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \cdot 2 = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

Finally, comparing with the options, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
