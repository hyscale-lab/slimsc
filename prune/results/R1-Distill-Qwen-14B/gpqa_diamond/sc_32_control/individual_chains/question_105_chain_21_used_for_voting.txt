Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a star with some spots on it and how that affects the observed brightness over time. Then, they're asking what size of exoplanet would produce a similar brightness variation if there were no spots. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and change the observed brightness. From our point of view, this looks like periodic variations. But this situation is being compared to an exoplanet transit, which also causes a dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star.

The question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius (Rpl) would create the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do?

I think the approach here is to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then find the planet size that would cause the same change.

First, let's understand what the filling factor is. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, f is 20%, which is 0.2.

The spots are cooler: the star's Teff is 6000K, spots are 6000-1000=5000K. So each spot has a lower temperature.

The brightness variation comes from the difference in flux when the spots are on the visible side versus when they're not. When the star rotates, spots move in and out of view, so the observed flux changes.

So the first step is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (delta F / F) caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the total flux from the star decreases. But when the star rotates and the spots are on the far side, the flux returns to normal. So the maximum dip in brightness would be when the spotted hemisphere is entirely facing us. But since it's only one hemisphere with spots, maybe the maximum effect is when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so if one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. The spot coverage is 20% of the star's surface.

Wait no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere? Or 20% of the entire star's surface? The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the entire hemisphere is 20% covered by spots? Or the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, "filling factor" usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered. So if the star's hemisphere is covered with spots, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Or wait, perhaps it's 20% of one hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, the term 'filling factor' can sometimes be a bit ambiguous. Let me think. The entire surface area of the star is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So if the filling factor is 0.2 for the hemisphere, that means the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The total area of the star is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface. But wait, the problem states that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So perhaps that's 0.2 of the hemisphere's area. So 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the fraction of the total star area covered is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1 or 10%. Hmm, but the problem says "the star has a radius equal to the Sun", but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed as follows: the contribution of the spots to the total flux when they're in view. The star emits flux F = σT^4 * (area) / (4π), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the area and the difference in temperature.

The star's total flux is F = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π) ) = σ T_eff^4 R^2. So F = σ T^4 R^2.

But when spots are present, the flux is F = F_star - F_spots + F_spots at their temperature.

Wait, no. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, they contribute less flux. So the observed flux is F = F_0 - (F_spot - F_unspotted_area) * (area covered).

Wait, perhaps more accurately: The total flux when no spots are visible is F0 = σ T_star^4 * (4π R_star²) / (4π) ) = σ T_star^4 R_star².

When spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot * area_spot + F_unspotted * area_unspotted) - (F0 per unit area) * area_spot? Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux as the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) when the spots are visible is:

delta F = (F_unspotted - F_spotted) * area_spot / area_star.

Wait, no. Let me think: the star's normal flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π) )= σ T_eff^4 R².

When a fraction f of the star's surface is covered by spots, each spot has a temperature T_spot = T_star - delta T. So the flux from the spotted area is F_spot = σ T_spot^4 * (f * 4π R²) / (4π) ) = σ T_spot^4 R² f.

The flux from the unspotted area is F_unspotted = (1 - f) * σ T_star^4 R².

So the total flux is F = F_unspotted + F_spot = σ R² [ (1-f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

So the fractional change is (F - F0) / F0 = [ (1-f) T_star^4 + f T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ] / T_star^4.

Simplify numerator: (1-f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 - T^4 = [ (1-f) T^4 - f T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 ] / T^4.

Wait that's [ (1 - f - f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 ] / T^4.

So (1 - 2f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 ) / T^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me redo.

Wait, F = (1 - f) F_unspotted per unit area + f F_spot per unit area.

Wait, F_unspotted per unit area is σ T^4, F_spot is σ (T - delta T)^4. So the average flux per unit area is:

F_avg = (1 - f) σ T^4 + f σ (T - delta T)^4.

So total flux is F_avg * 4π R² / 4π = F_avg * R².

Thus, F_avg = σ R² [ (1 - f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 ]

The fractional change is (F_avg - F0)/F0, where F0 is σ R² T^4.

So delta F/F0 = [ (1 - f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 - T^4 ] / T^4.

Simplify numerator:

(1 - f) T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4 - T^4 = - f T^4 + f (T - delta T)^4.

Factor out f:

f [ (T - delta T)^4 - T^4 ]

So delta F/F0 = [ f ( (T - delta T)^4 - T^4 ) ] / T^4.

Which is f * [ (T - delta T)^4 / T^4 - 1 ].

So that's the fractional change.

In this case, T is 6000 K, delta T is 1000 K, f is 0.2.

Let me compute that.

First, compute (6000 - 1000) = 5000 K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the term in the brackets is (0.48225 - 1) = -0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * (-0.51775) = -0.10355.

So delta F/F0 ≈ -0.10355, which is about a 10.355% decrease in flux.

Wait, wait. But wait, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0, and when they're on the near side, it's lower. So the maximum dip in flux is 10.355% of F0, which is about a 10% drop.

Wait, but the question says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the observed flux. So the maximum dip occurs when the spotted area is entirely visible. But since the problem states that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet," which would cause a dip when it transits in front of the star.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is about 10%, as per our calculation. Now, we need to find the radius of a planet such that when it transits in front of the star, the dip in brightness is the same amplitude, i.e., 10%.

Wait, no: the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude. So the amplitude from the planet is the same as the amplitude from the spots: ~10% drop.

Wait, but the planet would cause a dip when it transits. The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and the transit blocks that fraction of the star's light.

Wait, wait, no. The dip in brightness is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

So the fractional change is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need this to equal the fractional change from the spots, which is 0.10355, approximately 0.104.

So (R_planet / R_star)^2 ≈ 0.104 → R_planet ≈ sqrt(0.104) * R_star.

Compute sqrt(0.104): let's see, 0.3^2=0.09, 0.32^2=0.1024, 0.33^2=0.1089.

So sqrt(0.104) is approximately 0.322. So R_planet ≈ 0.322 R_star.

Wait, but wait. Let me redo the spot calculation to be precise.

Wait, when the star is not covered by spots, the planet would cause a dip when it transits. So the dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

But in the spot scenario, the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, which causes a dip of 0.10355. So we set (R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_planet ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322 R_star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait, there's a mistake here. Because the star's spot coverage is on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view. So the maximum dip isn't when all the spots are visible, but perhaps when the spot is on the limb. Wait, no. If the spot is on the hemisphere, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered with spots. So when it's facing us, that hemisphere's spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is in view.

Wait, but the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty." So when the star rotates, the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view. So, the maximum dip would occur when the spotted hemisphere is entirely visible, and the minimum when it's not. So the variation in flux is between F0 and F0 - delta F, where delta F is 0.10355 F0.

But the amplitude of the brightness variation is the change in flux. So the amplitude is delta F, which is 0.10355 F0.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2 F0, so the dip amplitude is (R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.10355. So R_planet ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322 R_star.

So the answer would be around 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2=0.152, which is bigger than 0.104.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049, way too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121, still small.

D) ~0.32 → ~0.102, which matches.

So D is the correct answer.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \) (20% of the hemisphere's area).
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 R_{\text{star}}^2 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the spots are visible, the flux decreases due to the cooler spots. The fractional change in flux is given by:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \left[ \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 - 1 \right].
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( f = 0.2 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left[ \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 - 1 \right].
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left( 0.48225 - 1 \right) = 0.2 \times (-0.51775) \approx -0.10355.
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is approximately \( -0.10355 \), or a 10.355% decrease in brightness.

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transit is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots (\( \Delta F / F_0 \approx -0.10355 \)), we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
