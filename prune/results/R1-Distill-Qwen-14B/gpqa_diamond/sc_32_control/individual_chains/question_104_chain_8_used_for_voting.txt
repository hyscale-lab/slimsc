Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. Radial velocity, RV method, detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards or away from us.

So the question says two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the shifts in the spectral lines are different. Planet 1's star had a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet 2's star had a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How does the RV shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )^(1/1) )). Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between velocity and period.

Alternatively, I recall that the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( sin i ) / P^(1/3) )

Since the planets are Neptune mass and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so (1-e²)^½ is 1. So K ≈ ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / P^(1/3 )

But since both planets are similar mass and the stars are same, and sin i is probably similar (but I think the question assumes i is the same, or maybe it's not given, so maybe I can ignore it or the ratio will take care of it.

Wait, but actually, in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) * (1 / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3))) ) * (something with sin i). But in this problem, both M_p and M_star are same for both planets. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Because if K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3.

Given that, the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity of the star. So the radial velocity K is proportional to the wavelength shift. Because a larger shift means a higher velocity.

Wait, the wavelength shift is due to Doppler effect. The formula for Doppler shift is Δλ/λ = v/c. So the measured shift is proportional to velocity. Therefore, if K is the semi-amplitude, then K ∝ Δλ. So K for planet 1 is 5, planet 2 is 7 (in milliangstroms, but the units cancel when taking the ratio).

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me get that right. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So:

K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const

K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait no, let's check:

Wait, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

So for K1 and K2, P1 and P2:

P1 = (const) * (1/K1^3 )

P2 = (const) * (1/K2^3 )

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because const cancels, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, if K = const * (1/P^(1/3)), then 1/K = (P^(1/3)) / const.

So P = (const)^-3 * (1/K^3). So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, yes, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

But wait, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

So, K1/K2 = 5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, wait no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude, which is the velocity. So K1 = 5, K2 =7. So the ratio K1/K2 =5/7.

Since P is inversely proportional to K^3, so P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because P is proportional to 1/K^3. So P2 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) * P1.

Which is (K1^3 / K2^3) * P1.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Which is P2 = P1 * 125/343 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So the period of planet #2 is longer than planet #1 by a factor of 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is longer than P1 by 0.364 times. So the answer is approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of the RV signal is proportional to the star's velocity, which is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. For planets with similar masses and host stars of the same mass, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), or equivalently, \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given that Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Since \( P \propto 1/K^3 \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
