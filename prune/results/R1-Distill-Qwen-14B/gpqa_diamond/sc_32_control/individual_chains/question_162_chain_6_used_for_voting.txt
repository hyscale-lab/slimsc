Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tells us about the geometry of spacetime. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)](dx² + dy²). Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. So the metric is given in terms of x and y, but I thought pseudospheres are related to 2-dimensional surfaces. Oh wait, maybe this is a 2D space? Or is it part of a higher-dimensional spacetime?

So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the classic example. The area of a pseudosphere... I think the area is finite, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric and see what kind of space it describes. The metric is given as ds² equals some function times (dx² + dy²). So it's a 2-dimensional metric. Let's write it out:

ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²)

Hmm, so the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²), since r² = x² + y², right? So in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y², so the metric becomes:

ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²)

But wait, wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 - r². So the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²). 

This looks like a metric for a space with a curvature that depends on r. To find the area, I can calculate the area element. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dθ dr, but actually in polar coordinates, for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the area element dA is (1/2) * sqrt(B(r)) ) * r dr dθ. Wait, no, actually, the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2}) (dr dθ). But in this case, there's no cross term (g_{rθ}=0), so it's sqrt(g_{rr} * g_{θθ}) dr dθ. 

So g_{rr} is 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} is 32/(4 - r²) multiplied by r²? Wait no, the metric in polar coordinates would have g_{rr} = (32/(4 - r²)), and g_{θθ} = (32/(4 - r²)) * r²? Or wait, no, let me see. The original metric is written as (32/(4 - r²)) * (dx² + dy²). So when you go to polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the entire metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

So the g_{rr} component is 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} is [32/(4 - r²)] * r². 

But when calculating the area element, it's sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a 2D metric, the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} - (g_{rθ})^2. But since g_{rθ} is zero, the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}. 

Wait, no, wait. The determinant of a 2x2 metric tensor [[g_{rr}, g_{rθ}], [g_{θr}, g_{θθ}]] is g_{rr} g_{θθ} - (g_{rθ})². Since g_{rθ} is zero, determinant is g_{rr} g_{θθ}.

So the area element is sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. Let's compute that.

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²)
g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²)

So determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but sqrt of that would be sqrt( (32)^2 r² )/(4 - r²) ) = 32 r / (4 - r²).

Wait, no: sqrt( (32 *32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = sqrt( (32² r²) ) / (4 - r²) ) = (32 r) / (4 - r²). 

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Now, the area is the integral of the area element over the region. So the area A would be the double integral over r and θ.

But wait, what is the range of r? The denominator is 4 - r². So the metric is defined where 4 - r² > 0, so r² <4, so r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2.

So θ goes from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

So the area is:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ

Let's compute this integral.

First, separate the integrals. The integrand is [32 r/(4 - r²)] * dr, and then we integrate over θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = [ ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ ] * [ ∫ (r=0 to 2) (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ]

The θ integral is ∫ dθ from 0 to 2π, which is 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Now, let's compute the integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Hmm, let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ (32) * (r dr) / u

Which with substitution becomes ∫ (32) * (-du/2) / u → (-32/2) ∫ du/u → -16 ∫ du/u = -16 ln|u| + C.

So ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = -16 ln|4 - r²| + C.

Now, evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: 4 - (2)^2 = 0. So ln(0) is -infty. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches zero, so ln(4 - r²) approaches ln(0) which is negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to 2 would be:

[-16 ln(4 - r²)] from 0 to 2.

At r=2, ln(0) → -infty → -16*(-infty) = +infty.

At r=0, ln(4) is finite.

So the integral becomes:

[ -16 ln(0) ) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ] → [ +infty ] - [ -16 ln4 ]

So the integral is infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the area element becomes infinite at r=2. But that would imply that the area is infinite, but the pseudosphere is a finite area surface, right?

Wait, am I missing something? Maybe I should think again about the metric.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm. So if we're in 2D, then the space is a surface with this metric. So the space is defined for r² <4, which is a disk of radius 2. But what is the geometry here?

Wait, in 2D, the metric g = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²) describes a space with a specific curvature. Since the coefficient is 32/(4-r²), which behaves like a function that blows up at r=2.

Wait, I think this is a model of hyperbolic space. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the metric can have terms that approach infinity at a certain radius, leading to finite area. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, hyperbolic space extends to infinity, so the area would be infinite. But that can't be right because the metric here is only defined up to r=2.

Wait a second, perhaps this metric is a model of a compact hyperbolic surface. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric for a sphere with a specific curvature, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, the question says it's a pseudosphere. Oh, wait, pseudosphere is a surface in 3D with constant negative curvature, but in this question, the metric is 2-dimensional, so perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but then the area would be infinite. Because in hyperbolic plane, the area of a circle of radius R is 2π (cosh R -1), which grows exponentially, so it's infinite as R approaches infinity. But in our case, the r is limited to 2, so maybe the area is finite?

Wait, earlier calculation suggests that the area integral goes to infinity due to the behavior near r=2. Because the integrand becomes 32r/(4 - r²) which approaches 32*2/(0) as r approaches 2, which is a singularity.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. So when integrating from r=0 to r=2, the integrand becomes 32r/(4 - r²) dr. Let's compute the definite integral correctly.

Integral of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

As u =4 - r², du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (32) * (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u = (-32/2) ∫ (du/u) ) = -16 ∫ du/u = -16 ln |u| + C.

So the definite integral from 0 to 2 is:

[-16 ln(4 - r²)] from 0 to 2.

At r=2, ln(0) is negative infinity. So -16*(-infty) = +infty.

At r=0, it's -16 ln(4).

So the definite integral is (infinite) - (-16 ln4) → infinite.

So the area A is 2π * (infinite) → infinite.

So the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But wait, the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere's area is finite? Let me think, the standard pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. So why does the integral give infinity here?

Wait, perhaps the metric given isn't for the entire pseudosphere, but just a portion of it. Or perhaps the metric I'm looking at is for a different kind of surface.

Wait, no, the standard pseudosphere in 3D is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it's a finite area. But in this question, the metric is 2D, so perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think about the metric again.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Let me see, for a 2D space, the line element is given, so perhaps it's a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space with radius related to 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to see what's going on.

In 2D, the Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula involving the metric components. The formula is:

K = - (1/(2*sqrt(g))) * ∂_r (sqrt(g) * g_{rr}^{(2)} )

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the coefficients.

Alternatively, for a metric in polar coordinates ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = [1/(2 B)] [d/dr (A/B) ] + [1/(2 r B)] ( (1/B) - (A)/(r² B) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to use the formula for K in terms of the coefficients A and B.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature K is K = - (1/(2 A)) (d/dr (A)) / r + (1/(2 r² A)) (d/dr (A)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula.

Alternatively, for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ², the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = [ (B')/(2 A B) ) - (1/(2 r A)) ]

Where prime denotes derivative with respect to r.

In our case, A(r) = 32/(4 - r²), and B(r) = 32/(4 - r²) * r² ?

Wait, no, wait. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32/(4 - r²)] r² dθ².

So A(r) = 32/(4 - r²), B(r) = 32/(4 - r²) * r².

So B(r) = (32 r²)/(4 - r²).

Now, let's compute the derivatives.

First, find A(r) = 32/(4 - r²) = 32 (4 - r²)^(-1).

A' (r) = dA/dr = 32 * (-1) * (-2 r) (4 - r²)^(-2) ) = 64 r / (4 - r²)^2.

B(r) = 32 r²/(4 - r²) → let's compute B'(r):

B'(r) = [ (64 r) (4 - r²) ) - (32 r²)( -2 r ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, using the quotient rule: numerator is (64r)(4 - r²) + (32 r²)(2 r).

Wait, wait, let me compute correctly:

d/dx [ f/g ] = (f’ g - f g’) / g².

So f = 32 r², f’ = 64 r.

g = 4 - r², g’ = -2 r.

So B'(r) = [64 r (4 - r²) - (32 r²)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] / denominator.

Factor out 64 r:

= 64 r [ (4 - r²) + r² ] / denominator.

= 64 r [4] / denominator.

So B'(r) = (256 r) / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:

K = [ (B')/(2 A B) ) - (1/(2 r A)) ].

Plugging in the expressions:

First, compute each term.

Term1 = (B')/(2 A B )

= [256 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] / [ 2 * (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

2 * (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) 
= 2 * (32*32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 )
= 2048 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So term1 = [256 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] / [2048 r² / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

= 256 r / 2048 r² = (256 / 2048) * (r / r²) = (1/8) * (1/r) = 1/(8 r).

Term2 = (1)/(2 r A) = 1/( 2 r * [32/(4 - r²)] ) ) 
= (4 - r²)/(64 r )

So K = term1 - term2.

K = [1/(8 r)] - [ (4 - r²) / (64 r) ]

= [8/(64 r)] - [ (4 - r²) / (64 r) ) ]

= [8 - (4 - r²)] / (64 r )

= [8 -4 + r² ]/(64 r )

= [4 + r² ]/(64 r )

Hmm, this seems complicated. But wait, for the pseudosphere (tractricoid), the Gaussian curvature is constant and negative. But according to this, K is a function of r, which depends on where you are on the surface.

Wait, that can't be right because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature everywhere. So perhaps this metric doesn't correspond to a pseudosphere, which is confusing because the question says it's a pseudosphere with radius 2. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, let me think again about the metric. Maybe I should consider the given metric as part of a higher-dimensional spacetime, like a 3+1-dimensional case, but the question specifically talks about a pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2, given this metric. But earlier, when I tried computing the area, the integral gave me infinity, which is option D. But if the pseudosphere is a finite area, that can't be.

Wait, but maybe the radius r=2 in the question refers to something else. Let me think about the metric again.

In the metric, the denominator is 4 - r². So when r=2, the denominator is zero. So the metric blows up at r=2. That suggests a singularity at r=2, so the space is only defined for r < 2.

Wait, in 2D, a metric that blows up at a certain radius would imply that the area up to that radius is finite. Let me think: for example, the area of a circle in polar coordinates, if the area element becomes singular at a certain r, but the integral might diverge.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the area, the integral went to infinity because of the 1/(4 - r²) term. So perhaps the area is infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.

But the question specifically says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So I'm a bit confused because I thought pseudospheres have finite area. But maybe in this case, due to the metric's form, the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not for the entire pseudosphere, but just a part. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the area.

Wait, another approach: let's look for a coordinate transformation. Suppose we make a substitution to simplify the metric.

Let me set u = r². Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use a substitution that makes the denominator 4 - r² into something else.

Wait, perhaps the metric is similar to a hyperbolic metric. In hyperbolic space, a common metric is ds² = dr² + (a^2) sinh²(r/a) (dθ)^2, or similar. But in this case, the metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), which resembles a metric for a space with a curvature that increases towards r=2.

Wait, but again, the area calculation led to an infinite result. So the area is infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, the question gives options:

A) 0

B) 4π(x²+y²)

C)4π(x²−y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the area is infinite, then the answer is D. So I think that's the case.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2-dimensional space with a metric that depends on \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). Rewriting the metric in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we have:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating the area element over the region where the metric is defined. The metric is valid for \(r < 2\), as the denominator \(4 - r^2\) must remain positive. Therefore, the limits of integration are \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\) and \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = 2\pi\). The area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, integrate over \(r\). Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{du}{u} = -16 \ln|u| \Big|_{u=4}^{u=0}.
\]

At \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\), and \(\ln(0)\) diverges to \(-\infty\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is:
