Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that metrics in general relativity describe the geometry of spacetime, but here I think it's more about the geometry of the space itself.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. So maybe it's describing a 2D surface. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, often visualized as having a "saddle" shape.

I'm trying to recall the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, I think the area of a pseudosphere is related to its radius. For a sphere, the area is 4πr², but pseudospheres are different. Oh wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite area, isn't it? Because as you go towards the "rim", the surface extends infinitely, so its area is infinite. But wait, the metric given here might be representing something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the metric itself. Let's analyze it. The line element is in terms of x and y, so it's a 2D metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the domain of x and y is such that 4 - x² - y² is positive. So x² + y² <4. That means x and y are within a circle of radius 2. So the maximum x² + y² is 4, but when it approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, but with a metric that becomes singular at the boundary.

Wait, but what does this have to do with a pseudosphere? Maybe the metric is conformally flat because it's written as a function times (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally equivalent to the flat Euclidean metric. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the surface is a two-dimensional surface embedded in some space, perhaps in 3D, but the metric is given in 2D.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, but the pseudosphere's radius is a parameter, not sure how it relates to the coordinates here. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a pseudosphere with r=2, so maybe we can compute the area from the metric.

In differential geometry, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me compute the determinant here.

The metric tensor is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and off-diagonal terms zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So the area is the integral of this over the region where x² + y² <4. So the area A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, but integrating that over a circular region. Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²).

So A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The integral over θ is 2π. So A = 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let's compute the radial integral I = ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes I = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ]

Wait, so I = ∫ from 4 to 0 → which is same as ∫ from 0 to4 with a minus sign.

Wait, let me express it correctly.

I = ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r dr / (4 - r²)].

Substituting u =4 - r², du =-2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So I becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (-du/2) / u ].

= ∫ from 4 to 0 [ -16 (du)/u ] → which is same as ∫ from 0 to4 (16 du)/u.

So I = 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to4.

Wait, 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4 → 16 (ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity.

So I is infinite. Therefore, the area A is 2π * I, which is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Wait a second, but the options include D) +infty. So that would be the answer. But wait, what's the connection to the pseudosphere's radius? The given metric has a denominator (4 -x² -y²), so 4 is 2². So r=2 in the problem. So perhaps the pseudosphere of radius 2 has infinite area.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the domain of \(x\) and \(y\) is constrained to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. As \(x^2 + y^2\) approaches 4, the metric blows up, indicating a singularity at the boundary.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere, we use the area element in 2D, which is \(\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is 

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes 

\[
\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area is then given by the integral of the area element over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates \(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), with \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) gives a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 16 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration, this becomes:

\[
A = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
A = 32\pi \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, and the area \(A\) is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.
