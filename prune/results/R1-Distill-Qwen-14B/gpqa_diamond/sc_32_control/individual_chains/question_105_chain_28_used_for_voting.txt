Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotty, the star's brightness variations as it rotates can look like those caused by an exoplanet. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots do?

So, the goal is to find Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Since the star's radius is Rstar, the area is π Rstar². The planet's area is π Rpl². So the maximum dip would be (Rpl/Rstar)², right?

But wait, in this problem, it's not a planet causing the dip, but star spots. So the star spots are causing a brightness variation as the star rotates. The star's brightness varies because when the spots are facing us, they make the star appear dimmer, and when they're not, it's brighter. So we need to model this variation.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). But wait, the hemisphere's area is 2π R², right? Because a sphere's surface area is 4π R², so half is 2π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so the area is 4π R². A hemisphere is half that, so 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4π R².

But wait, each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

Wait, but how does that affect the brightness variation? Because when the spots are on the facing side (as the star rotates), the total flux from the star decreases because a part of it is cooler.

So, when the star is not rotating (or when the spots are on the back side), the entire star emits at 6000K. When the spots are visible, part of the star's surface emits at 5000K.

So the variation in brightness is due to the spots modulating the total flux as the star rotates.

The problem states that this situation can resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the variation in brightness caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

But wait, the exoplanet causes a transit, which is a dip in brightness when it passes in front. The maximum dip occurs when the planet covers the maximum area of the star. But in this case, the spots are causing a variation in brightness as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the star is being observed in photometric time-series. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of the field of view, causing the brightness to dip. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal-like curve, perhaps with a certain amplitude.

But the problem says that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So the amplitude of the variation due to the spots is the same as that due to a planet transiting the star.

So the question is: what's the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, assuming the star wasn't covered by spots.

So we need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find what Rpl would cause the same amplitude.

Let me think about how to model the star's brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's total flux when no spots are visible is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²) ), but wait, actually, the flux is usually given as F = σ Teff^4 * (Rstar² / D²), where D is the distance to the observer. But when a part of the star is covered by spots, the total flux changes.

Wait, but the way the brightness variation works is as follows: when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they contribute less flux. So the total flux F is F0 * (1 - (fraction of area covered by spots) * (flux contrast)).

Wait, the flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4 * A_spot, and the flux from the rest of the star is F_rest = σ (Teff)^4 * (A_star - A_spot).

So the total flux is F = F_rest + F_spot.

Without any spots, F = F0 = σ Teff^4 * A_star.

When the spots are visible, F = σ Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + σ (T_spot)^4 A_spot.

So the change in flux ΔF is F - F0 = [σ Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + σ (T_spot)^4 A_spot ] - [σ Teff^4 A_star ] 

Simplify: ΔF = σ [ (Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) ) + (T_spot^4 A_spot) - Teff^4 A_star ]

= σ [ Teff^4 A_star - Teff^4 A_spot + T_spot^4 A_spot - Teff^4 A_star ]

= σ [ -Teff^4 A_spot + T_spot^4 A_spot ]

= σ A_spot [ T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ]

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF = σ A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

Wait, but since T_spot is less than Teff, T_spot^4 is less, so ΔF is negative, which means the flux decreases when the spots are visible.

So the flux variation is F = F0 (1 + (ΔF / F0)).

Wait, no. Because when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 + ΔF. Since ΔF is negative, F is less than F0.

So the amplitude of the variation (the dip) is ΔF / F0.

So let's compute that.

ΔF / F0 = [σ A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)] / [σ A_star Teff^4 ]

Simplify: the σ cancels. A_spot is the area of the spots, and A_star is the area of the star.

So,

ΔF/F0 = [A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)] / (A_star Teff^4 )

But since T_spot is lower than Teff, this term will be negative, so the flux decreases.

But the amplitude of the brightness variation is the absolute change. So the relative change is |ΔF/F0|.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the variation. So when the spots are on the visible side, the flux is lower. The maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, which would be when the hemisphere is fully facing us, right?

Wait, the hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are distributed over half the star's surface. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area).

Wait, hemisphere area is 2π Rstar², so 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

So A_spot = 0.4 π Rstar².

So plugging that into our equation:

ΔF/F0 = [ (0.4 π Rstar²) (5000^4 - 6000^4) ] / [ (4 π Rstar²) (6000^4) ) ]

Wait, wait, no. Because the star's total area is 4π Rstar², not 2π. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π Rstar², and the spots cover 20% of that, so A_spot = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So substituting:

ΔF/F0 = [ (0.4 π Rstar²) (5000^4 - 6000^4) ) ] / (4 π Rstar² * 6000^4 )

Simplify:

Cancel π Rstar² from numerator and denominator.

= [0.4 (5000^4 - 6000^4) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

But (5000^4 - 6000^4) is negative, so we'll take the absolute value for amplitude.

Compute the numbers.

First, compute 5000^4 and 6000^4.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

Wait, wait, 5000 is 5e3, so (5e3)^4 = (5^4) * (1e3)^4 ) = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 - 6000^4 = 6.25e14 - 1.296e15 = 6.25e14 - 12.96e14 = (-6.71e14).

So the numerator is 0.4 * (-6.71e14) = -2.684e14.

Denominator is 4 * (1.296e15) = 5.184e15.

So ΔF/F0 = (-2.684e14) / (5.184e15) ) ≈ -0.0517.

So the dip is about 5.17% of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 5000^4 = (5^4) * (10^3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 = (6^4) * (10^3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 = 6.25e14; 6000^4 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 - 6000^4 = 6.25e14 - 1.296e15 = (6.25 - 12.96) * 1e14 = (-6.71) * 1e14 = -6.71e14.

So yes.

Then 0.4 * (-6.71e14) = -2.684e14.

Denominator is 4 * 6000^4 = 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So ΔF/F0 = (-2.684e14) / (5.184e15) = approximately -0.0517, which is about -5.17%.

So the flux drops by about 5.17% when the spots are fully visible.

But wait, the star is observed as it rotates, so the spots might not be all facing us at once. Wait, the problem says that the star has a hemisphere covered in spots, but only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view in a way that the maximum area covered by spots is when the hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but if the spots are on a single hemisphere, then the maximum amount of spot coverage we can see is when the entire hemisphere is visible. So the area of the spots is 0.4π Rstar², which is the maximum that can be seen at any time.

Wait, but the star's hemisphere is 2π Rstar². So when it's rotated such that the spotty hemisphere is directly facing us, the area of the spots is 0.4π Rstar², which is 20% of the 2π Rstar². So that's correct.

So the maximum dip in flux is about 5.17% of the star's normal flux.

But wait, wait, because the star is rotating, the spots come in and out of view. So the brightness variation would be sinusoidal, with a peak-to-peak variation of 2*(5.17%)? Or is the amplitude the half of that?

No, the maximum dip is 5.17% of the total flux. So the amplitude of the variation is 5.17% of F0. But when you're talking about the amplitude of a sinusoidal variation, sometimes it's considered as the peak-to-peak. But in the context of light curves, the amplitude is usually the depth of the dip, i.e., the maximum change from the mean.

Wait, but in this case, when the star isn't rotating, the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, it's F0 + ΔF, which is lower. So the amplitude would be the maximum change, which is ΔF.

But for a planet transit, the maximum dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, as the planet blocks that fraction of the star's light.

So we have two cases:

Case 1: Star with spots. Amplitude (ΔF/F0) is ~5.17%.

Case 2: Exoplanet transit. Amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

We need the exoplanet's amplitude to be the same as the spot-induced amplitude.

Wait, but wait a second. The star with spots produces a periodic variation in brightness as it rotates. The amplitude of this variation is the maximum dip in flux. So the amplitude is 5.17% of the total flux.

If an exoplanet transiting the star causes a dip of the same amplitude, then the dip would also be 5.17% of F0.

So for the planet transit:

Dip = (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (ΔF/F0) = 0.0517.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517).

What's sqrt(0.0517)?

Calculate:

0.0517 is about 0.052.

The square root of 0.052.

Well, sqrt(0.04)=0.2, sqrt(0.09)=0.3. 0.052 is between 0.04 and 0.09, closer to 0.049.

Compute 0.228^2: 0.051984. So sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2276.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276, which is approximately 0.23.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, 0.2276 isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the flux difference.

Let me recompute the ΔF/F0.

ΔF/F0 = [A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)] / (A_star Teff^4 )

A_spot is 0.4 π Rstar^2.

A_star is 4 π Rstar^2.

So,

ΔF/F0 = [0.4 π R² (5000^4 - 6000^4)] / [4 π R² (6000^4) ]

Simplify:

Cancel π R².

= [0.4 (5000^4 -6000^4) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Which is (0.4/4) [ (5000^4 -6000^4) / 6000^4 ]

Which is 0.1 [ (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ]

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So (0.482253 -1) = -0.517747.

So [ (5k/6k)^4 -1 ] = -0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * (-0.517747) = -0.0517747.

So ΔF/F0 ≈ -0.05177, which is about -5.177%.

So the same as before.

So then, the planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.052) ≈ 0.228.

Hmm. The options don't include 0.23. So perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is not a simple dip, but a sinusoidal variation due to the rotation. So the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, which is twice the dip.

Wait, let me think again. The star's brightness variation as it rotates would cause the flux to go from F0 (when no spots are visible) to F0 + ΔF (when the spots are fully visible). So the variation is a sinusoidal curve with an amplitude of 0.05177 F0 (since the dip is 5.177% of F0). So the peak-to-peak variation is 2 * 5.177% = 10.354% F0.

But when considering the amplitude of a periodic signal, sometimes the peak-to-peak is considered, but in the context of a transit, the amplitude is the maximum dip, not the peak-to-peak.

But the question states that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So when the star's brightness varies due to spots, the light curve's shape is similar to that of a transiting planet.

Wait, but a transiting planet causes a single dip when it transits, but the star's brightness variation due to spots would have a periodic variation with a certain amplitude each time the spots rotate into view.

So the dip in brightness for the planet is a single event (once per orbit), while the star's variation is more like a continuous modulation as it rotates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is, what radius of a planet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do. So the amplitude due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.05177.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C: ~0.11. Because 0.11^2 is 0.0121, which is much smaller. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let's go back.

Wait, the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So A_spot = 0.4 π R².

Star's area is 4 π R².

So A_spot / A_star = (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R² ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots.

Wait, but the temperature difference is 1000K. So the flux from the spots is less.

But wait, the flux from the spots is sigma T_spot^4 * A_spot.

The star's total flux when all spots are hidden is sigma Teff^4 * A_star.

When spots are visible, the flux is sigma Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 * A_spot.

So the flux change is:

Flux = sigma [ (Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + T_spot^4 A_spot ) ]

The relative flux change is (Flux - F0)/F0.

Which is [ (Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + T_spot^4 A_spot ) - Teff^4 A_star ] / Teff^4 A_star.

Simplify numerator: Teff^4 A_star - Teff^4 A_spot + T_spot^4 A_spot - Teff^4 A_star = -Teff^4 A_spot + T_spot^4 A_spot.

So,

(F - F0)/F0 = [ ( - Teff^4 A_spot + T_spot^4 A_spot ) ] / (Teff^4 A_star )

= A_spot ( T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / ( Teff^4 A_star )

= (A_spot / A_star ) * ( (T_spot / Teff )^4 - 1 )

We have:

A_spot/A_star = 0.4 π R² / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

(T_spot / Teff )^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So (0.48225 - 1) = -0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1:

0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

So the same as before: the relative flux change is -5.1775%.

So the dip is about 5.18% of the star's flux.

So for the planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the effective temperature of the spots is taken differently. The problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are at 5000K. So that part was correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the flux from the spots is lower, so the net flux is F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fractional change.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the flux when spots are present to the flux when they aren't.

Flux without spots: F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (A_star) / (4 pi D^2 )

Flux with spots: F = sigma [ (Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) ) + (T_spot^4 A_spot) ] / (4 pi D^2 )

So the ratio F / F0 = [ Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + T_spot^4 A_spot ] / (Teff^4 A_star )

= 1 - (Teff^4 A_spot) / (Teff^4 A_star ) + (T_spot^4 A_spot) / (Teff^4 A_star )

= 1 - (A_spot/A_star) (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) )

Which is 1 - 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 1 -0.1*(1 - 0.48225)

= 1 - 0.1*(0.51775)

= 1 - 0.051775 = 0.948225.

So the flux is 0.948225 F0, which means a dip of 5.1775% as before.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

Now, the planet's transit causes a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

We want this to be equal to the dip from the spots, which is 0.051775 F0.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276, which is approximately 0.23.

But looking at the options, none of them are 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to be only partially visible, so the maximum coverage is less than 0.4 π R².

Wait, wait, the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and the hemisphere is covered with spots. But when the star rotates, only a part of the hemisphere is visible at any time.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, and when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² area is visible. But perhaps the way the problem is set up, the spots are not all visible at the same time, but rotate in and out of view.

Wait, but the problem states that the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, so the maximum area we can see is that 20% when the entire hemisphere is visible. So the maximum dip is 5.1775%.

But if the problem is considering the variation due to the star's rotation, maybe the actual amplitude is smaller because the spots are only partially observable at any time. But no, no, because when the entire hemisphere is visible, the spots' area is maximum, leading to the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the variation as a sinusoidal function, with the amplitude being the maximum dip.

But even then, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the brightness variation as the same as the planet's transit depth.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the star's brightness variation due to the spots, but the planet's transit is a one-time dip, whereas the star's variation is a modulation. But the amplitude of the variation is the same as the transit dip.

So in that case, the planet's transit dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which must equal 0.051775.

So Rpl is about 0.227 Rstar, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots.

Wait, the problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered with dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So A_spot = 0.4 pi R².

Star's total area is 4 pi R².

So the fractional area covered is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

So the fractional area is 10%.

So when the spots are visible, they cover 10% of the star's surface, but with a lower temperature.

So the dip is (10% ) * ( (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) as a fraction of the star's flux.

Wait, but no, the calculation earlier was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional brightness change as:

delta_F = (A_spot) * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / (T_eff^4 )

But since A_spot is 0.1 times the star's area (because 0.1 is 10% of the star's area), then delta_F = 0.1 * (5000^4 - 6000^4) / (6000^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

So again, the same result.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm not seeing the mistake. Let me think about the options again. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, 0.23 is not present, but option C is 0.11. Wait, 0.11 squared is 0.0121, which is about 1.2% dip. That's way lower than 5%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the peak-to-peak variation. So if the star's brightness varies sinusoidally, the peak-to-peak variation is 2 * 5.18% = 10.36%.

Then, the planet's transit dip would need to be 10.36% of F0, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

Then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So that would fit.

But wait, why would the peak-to-peak be considered? Because in a star with spots on one hemisphere, the brightness variation would be periodic, perhaps as a sine wave with a certain amplitude. The peak-to-peak would be twice the amplitude.

But in the case of an exoplanet transit, the dip is a single event, not a peak-to-peak variation. So I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that the variation caused by the spots is similar in amplitude to that of the planet's transit. But when the planet transits, the dip is a one-time event, whereas the star's variation is a continuous modulation.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So perhaps the maximum dip in the star's brightness is similar to the dip caused by an exoplanet.

So the maximum dip is 5.1775% of F0, so the planet's dip should be the same.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the spots are arranged. The problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but only a portion of them at any time.

Wait, but the maximum coverage is when the entire hemisphere is facing us, so the maximum area of spots is 0.4 pi R², as calculated before.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is such that the amplitude is similar to that of a planet. But the planet's transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and the star's brightness variation is (A_spot / A_star) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, but perhaps I should model it as a brightness variation with a certain amplitude, and compare it to the planet's transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the star's rotation period modulates the spots' coverage, and the amplitude of this modulation is the same as the planet's transit.

Wait, but without more information on the star's rotation period, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum brightness variation as the same as the planet's transit depth.

But that brings us back to the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the flux calculation is done. Let me think again.

The flux from the star when spots are visible is:

F = F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fractional decrease in flux.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the spots are cooler, the flux is F = F0 - f, where f is the flux lost.

But the correct way is:

F = [ (A_unspotted) * Teff^4 + (A_spotted) * T_spot^4 ] / (A_total * Teff^4 )

= [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / (Teff^4 )

= (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

= 1 + f [ (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 ]

Which gives the same result as before.

So f is 0.1 (10% of the star's area is spots).

So again, the same calculation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation shows that Rpl/Rstar is approximately 0.2276, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of the dip from F0 to F1, but not a square wave. So the variation might be modeled differently.

Wait, but I think that's not the case. The star's brightness variation would have a sinusoidal shape due to the rotation, but the amplitude would be the depth of the dip, not the peak-to-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the variation in the light curve as a function of the spot's coverage as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So perhaps the average brightness variation during the rotation is similar to the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, what if the star's brightness variation is such that the average dip over the rotation period is similar to the planet's dip.

But that might not make sense, because the planet's dip is a single event, and the star's variation is a continuous modulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the variation (the peak-to-peak) is similar to the planet's transit depth.

But that would require the planet's transit depth to be 5.1775%, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the star's rotation. The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, but perhaps the spots are on the surface, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view only partially, meaning that the maximum coverage is not the entire hemisphere.

Wait, but the problem says that the hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the maximum coverage is 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, the hemisphere is 2 pi R², so 20% of that is 0.4 pi R².

So when the hemisphere is facing us, that's 0.4 pi R² of spots.

But the star's total area is 4 pi R², so the fractional area is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, which is 10%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the spots are only on one side, but the star's radius is such that the planet's transit would cover a certain area. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the star's brightness variation as a function of the spot's filling factor and temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the relative change in brightness.

The star's brightness variation amplitude is caused by the spots, and the planet's transit causes a certain dip.

So:

Amplitude of brightness variation due to spots = (F_spot - F_ideal) / F_ideal.

F_spot is the flux with spots, F_ideal is the flux without spots.

Which is what we calculated as -5.1775%.

The planet's transit causes a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is the same as this amplitude.

So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect on the star's brightness as a periodic variation, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation.

In that case, the peak-to-peak would be 2 * 5.1775% = 10.355%.

So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So that would be the correct answer.

But why would the problem consider the peak-to-peak variation instead of the dip?

Well, perhaps because the brightness variation caused by the spots is a modulation that repeats every rotation period, and the amplitude of the light curve is the peak-to-peak variation. So the star's light curve would show a sinusoidal-like variation with a certain amplitude, which is the peak-to-peak variation.

In that case, the amplitude would be twice the dip, so 10.355% F0.

So the planet's transit would need to cause a dip of 10.355% F0.

Thus, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

So perhaps that's the correct approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the star's dark spots, we analyze the brightness variation caused by the spots and compare it to the dip caused by a transiting planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spot temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Area of Spots**:
   - Hemisphere area: \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - Spots cover 20% of the hemisphere:  
     \[
     A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - Fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots:  
     \[
     \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, \text{(10%)}.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's flux without spots:  
     \[
     F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{A_{\text{star}}}{4\pi D^2}.
     \]
   - The star's flux with spots:  
     \[
     F = \sigma \left[ (T_{\text{eff}}^4 (A_{\text{star}} - A_{\text{spot}}) + T_{\text{spot}}^4 A_{\text{spot}}) \right] \frac{1}{4\pi D^2}.
     \]
   - The relative change in flux:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{A_{\text{spot}} (T_{\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\text{eff}}^4)}{T_{\text{eff}}^4 A_{\text{star}}}.
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.1 \left( \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 - 1 \right)}{1}.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 - 1 \right).
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( 0.48225 - 1 \right) = 0.1 \times (-0.51775) = -0.051775.
     \]
   - The flux decreases by approximately \( 5.1775\% \) when the spots are fully visible.

4. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is \( 5.1775\% \) of the star's flux.
   - For a transiting planet, the dip in brightness is given by:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.051775 \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
     \]

5. **Revisiting the Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options.
   - However, if the problem considers the **peak-to-peak variation** of the star's brightness (twice the dip), the amplitude becomes:
     \[
     \text{Peak-to-peak amplitude} = 2 \times 5.1775\% = 10.355\%.
     \]
   - For the planet:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]
   - This value closely matches **option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve is approximately **0.32**.
