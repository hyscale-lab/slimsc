Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I usually see stability constants increasing with the number of ligands, but here β3 is higher than β2 and β4 is lower than β3. Well, maybe they're arranged in some other order.

The question asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that dithiocyanato complexes have two SCN ligands attached. So, probably, the Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the species in question here. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure which β corresponds to which complex. Oh right, typically, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe I have the charges wrong. Let me think: each SCN- is -1. So Co is +2. So for [Co(SCN)_n], the charge would be 2 - n. So for n=1: +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. So the complexes would be [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^- , [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)4]^2- complex, which is blue, right? Or is it the dithiocyanate, which is two SCN-? Hmm, maybe I need to get this straight. I remember that the color depends on the geometry and the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)6]^3- is a common complex, but that's not our case here.

Wait, the problem is about dithiocyanato, so two ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0. But I'm not sure if that's blue. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)₂(NH3)]^+ is another complex, but that's probably not relevant here. Oh wait, the question is about the blue ones, which I think are the tetrahedral complexes. But wait, the [Co(SCN)4]^2- is known to be blue. Hmm, perhaps I should read up on that, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with the given data.

Wait, the question specifically mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So I need to find the fraction of this species among all cobalt species.

So to find the percentage, I need to calculate the distribution of each possible cobalt species, considering all possible complexes. The total cobalt is the sum of all the species: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^- , [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But wait, the problem gives four stability constants. So four possible complexes (n=1,2,3,4). So I'll need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

Stability constant (β) is given by the formula for each complex:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

But, the formation of each complex is stepwise. So for each step, the stability constant is the cumulative product of the previous steps. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the β given is the overall stability constant for each complex. So for each n, βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]. So for n=1, β1=9. For n=2, β2=40. For n=3, β3=63, and n=4, β4=16.

Wait, that's a bit confusing because β4 is less than β3. So the higher complexes aren't as stable as the lower ones? That might complicate things. So the idea is to calculate the concentration of each complex.

But first, the general approach is to use the stability constants to calculate the fraction of each complex present. The distribution depends on the concentration of SCN- and the stability constants.

Let me think of the general approach.

The formation of complex ions can be represented as:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]

The stability constant βn is given by:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

But for the distribution, we can model the fraction of each complex using these βs and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

However, since each complex formation is a step-wise process, the total fraction must consider all possibilities. But perhaps it's easier to assume that the ligand addition is step-wise, but given the β values, perhaps we can model the distribution using the given βn values.

Alternatively, considering that each βn is the cumulative stability constant, we can calculate the fraction of each complex using the following approach.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by (βn / β4) * ( [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [SCN^-]^4 * K4 )

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the general method for calculating the distribution.

The total concentration of Co is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The total SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M.

Each Co²+ can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN^- ligands.

The fraction of each complex can be found by considering their respective stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

The fraction f_n of [Co(SCN)_n]^charge is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( Σ_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait, in this expression, the denominator would be the sum for all possible n (from 0 to 4) of (βn [SCN^-]^n ). But wait, the [Co]^2+ is [Co] = c(Co) * (1 - Σ f_n ), assuming that all Co is in some complex. Oh, but wait, the sum of f_n plus the free [Co²+] would be 1, because all Co is either in one of the complexes or as free ions.

So, perhaps a better approach is to model the distribution using the β values and the ligand concentration.

An alternative approach is to model the problem with the assumption that the free [Co²+] is much lower than the total Co concentration. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, I think the correct way is to consider the total concentration of Co:

Total [Co] = [Co²+] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n] for n=1 to 4.

But since the solution is at equilibrium, the [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-].

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

So, substituting into the total Co concentration:

Total [Co] = [Co²+] + Σ (βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n ) for n=1 to 4.

Let me write this as:

c = [Co²+] ( 1 + Σ (βn [SCN^-]^n ) for n=1 to 4 )

But wait, because βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN^- ions, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the equation becomes:

Total Co = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Because for n=0, it's 1 (the free ion), and for n=1, it's β1 [SCN]^1, etc.

So, solving for [Co²+], we get:

[Co²+] = c / (1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4 ), where s is [SCN^-].

Wait, but wait: the exponents for [SCN^-] are n, which is correct.

Given that, we can compute [Co²+] and then find the distribution of each complex.

But let's plug in the numbers.

Given c(Co) = 1e-2 M = 0.01 M.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So s = 0.1.

Calculate denominator D:

D = 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4

Compute each term:

β1 s =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 s² =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4

β3 s³=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

β4 s^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

So summing all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So D = 2.3646.

Then [Co²+] = c / D = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004222 M.

Wait, 0.01 divided by about 2.3646. Let me compute that.

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004222 M.

Now, to find the concentration of each complex, [Co(SCN)_n], which is βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Compute each term:

For n=1: [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN]^1 =9 * 0.004222 *0.1.

Compute that:

9 * 0.004222 =0.037998. Multiply by 0.1: 0.0037998 M.

n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2=40 *0.004222 * (0.1)^2.

0.1^2 is 0.01. So 40 *0.004222=0.16888. Multiply by 0.01: 0.0016888 M.

n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^- =63 *0.004222 * (0.1)^3.

0.1^3=0.001. 63 *0.004222 =0.265566. Multiply by 0.001: 0.000265566 M.

n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2- =16 *0.004222 * (0.1)^4.

0.1^4=0.0001. 16 *0.004222=0.067552. Multiply by 0.0001: 0.0000067552 M.

Now, sum all the concentrations:

[Co²+] = 0.004222 M.

n=1: ~0.0038 M.

n=2: ~0.0016888 M.

n=3: ~0.0002656 M.

n=4: ~0.000006755 M.

Wait, let me add them up:

0.004222 (free Co²+) +

0.0037998 (n=1) = 0.0080218

+ 0.0016888 (n=2) =0.0097106

+0.000265566 (n=3)=0.009976166

+0.000006755 (n=4)=0.009982921 M.

Hmm, but the total Co concentration is 0.01 M. Let's check:

0.004222 +0.0037998 =0.0080218

+0.0016888=0.0097106

+0.000265566=0.009976166

+0.000006755=0.009982921.

But that's only about 0.009983, which is close to 0.01 but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me check the denominator D again.

D=1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016.

Adding:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646. So that part is correct.

Then [Co²+] = 0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004222 M.

Now, the concentrations of the complexes:

n=1: 9 * 0.004222 *0.1 = 9 *0.0004222=0.0037998 M.

n=2:40 *0.004222 *0.01 =40 *0.00004222=0.0016888 M.

n=3:63 *0.004222 *0.001=63 *0.000004222=0.0002656 M.

n=4:16 *0.004222 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004222=0.000006755 M.

So sum all:

0.004222 + 0.0037998 = 0.0080218

Plus 0.0016888: 0.0097106

Plus 0.0002656: 0.0099762

Plus 0.000006755: 0.009982955 M.

But total should be 0.01 M. So the sum is about 0.009983, which is very close to 0.01, considering rounding errors. So that's acceptable.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue complex is n=4, which is the tetra-dentate, [Co(SCN)4]^2-, but wait the dithiocyanato would be n=2. Hmm, earlier I thought the blue color is for n=4, but the question specifies dithiocyanato, which refers to two ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So the fraction for n=2 is 0.0016888 M.

Thus, the fraction f_2 is [Co(SCN)_2] / total Co.

But wait, the total Co is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.0016888 / 0.01 = 0.16888, which is 16.888%.

Looking at the options, D is 16.9%, which matches this. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I thought the blue color is for the tetra-dentate (n=4) complex. Am I mixing up something here?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. The blue complex is [Co(NH3)6]^3+, but that's with ammonia. Wait, no, I think [Co(SCN)4]^2- is blue. So perhaps the blue is for n=4. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN^- ligands, so n=2. So in that case, the percentage for n=2 is 16.88%, which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the tetra-dentate as blue and the dithiocyanato as another color. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, the question says, 'the blue dithiocyanato' which is a bit contradictory. Usually, dithiocyanato refers to two ligands. But the blue may refer to a different complex. Oh wait, perhaps I should look up the common colors of these complexes. But since I can't, I'll have to proceed based on the question's wording.

The question explicitly asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is for n=4, then we need to calculate the fraction for n=4.

Wait, but earlier I calculated for n=2. So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine.

The problem states: 'the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.' So 'dithiocyanato' implies two SCN ligands, which would be n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

But if the blue color is associated with a different complex, perhaps I'm mistaken. Wait, perhaps the color isn't directly tied to the number of ligands but the geometry or other factors. But without that information, I think I should proceed based on the question's wording.

But wait, the options have option C as 38.1%, which is higher than 16.9%. If the question is about the blue complex being n=4, let's see what the fraction is for that.

So for n=4, [Co(SCN)4]^2- is 0.000006755 M. So the fraction is 0.000006755 / 0.01 = 0.0006755, which is 0.06755%, which is way less than any of the options. So that can't be the case. So the blue probably refers to the n=2 complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the number of ligands wrong. If the dithiocyanato is two SCN, but the complex has more than two ligands but two dithiocyanate ligands. Hmm, not sure. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the complexes are not just varying in the number of SCN ligands but also include other ions. But the problem states it's a solution with Co(II) and thiocyanate; no other ligands are present. So the only ligands are SCN^-.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the formation of [Co(SCN)_n], where n can be up to 4.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is the second highest. Let me check the fractions.

The concentrations (in M):

[Co²+] = 0.004222 M → 4.222e-3.

n=1: 0.0037998 → 3.7998e-3.

n=2: 0.0016888 →1.6888e-3.

n=3: 0.0002656 →2.656e-4.

n=4: 6.755e-6.

So the fractions are:

[Co²+] → 4.222e-3 / 0.01 = 0.4222 → 42.22%.

n=1 → ~38%.

n=2 → ~16.89%.

n=3 → ~0.2656%.

n=4 → ~0.006755%.

So the largest fraction is the free Co²+ (42.22%), followed by n=1 (38%), then n=2 (16.89%).

So the percentage for n=2 is 16.89%, which matches option D (16.9%).

But wait, the question refers to 'blue dithiocyanato' complexes. If the blue is for n=4, which is minimal, that can't be. Hence, perhaps the blue refers to n=2. But that's conflicting with my initial assumption. Alternatively, maybe I've mixed up the complexes.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are arranged differently. For example, sometimes the stability constant for the first complex is the smallest, and they increase with the number of ligands. But in this case, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, followed by β2, β1, then β4. So the strongest complex is n=3.

Wait, but the [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have a higher concentration based on β3. Let me see:

Wait, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is calculated as 0.0002656 M, which is about 0.2656% of the total. So it's less than n=2. That's because, even though β3 is high, the [SCN^-]^3 drops off quickly, as each [SCN] is 0.1 M, so (0.1)^3 is 0.001, which is smaller than (0.1)^2=0.01, but β3 is 63, which is larger than β2=40.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the fraction for each complex.

But regardless, the question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Let me think again.

Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands, which would be n=2. So the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. The fraction is 16.89%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for n=1. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering which βn corresponds to which complex.

Wait, perhaps the βn are for different complexes. For example, maybe β1 is for [Co(SCN)(H2O)5]^+ and so on, but then the question would have to specify. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are arranged in a different way, like β1 is for [Co(SCN)4]^2- and β4 for [Co(SCN)].

Wait, but the problem statement says 'the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.' So each βn is for the complex with n SCN ligands.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the charge. The [Co(SCN)_n] complex has a charge of 2 - n, as each SCN is -1.

So for n=2, the charge is 0.

So if the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, then the calculation is correct, and the fraction is 16.89%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is approximately the fraction of n=1 (38%). So maybe the question is referring to a different complex. Alternatively, perhaps I have mixed up the n for the stability constants.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are in a different order. Maybe β1 is for the most stable complex. For example, if β4 is the highest, then n=4 would have the highest concentration. But in the given data, β3 is the highest (63), followed by β2=40, β1=9, β4=16.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are in the order of the complexes, but if the strongest complex is n=3, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recheck the calculation.

Denominator D =1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4.

s=0.1.

So:

β1 s =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 s²=40*(0.01)=0.4.

β3 s³=63*(0.001)=0.063.

β4 s^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

So D=1+0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So [Co²+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004222 M.

Then, for each complex:

n=1: β1 [Co^2+][s]^1 =9 *0.004222 *0.1= 0.0037998 M.

n=2:40 *0.004222 *0.01= 0.0016888 M.

n=3:63 *0.004222 *0.001=0.0002656 M.

n=4:16 *0.004222 *0.0001=0.000006755 M.

So the fractions:

n=1: 0.0037998/0.01=0.37998 → ~38%.

n=2: 0.0016888/0.01=0.16888 → ~16.89%.

So if the question is about dithiocyanato (n=2), then the fraction is ~16.89%, which is option D.

But the options also include option C:38.1%, which is about 38%, which is the fraction for n=1.

So perhaps the confusion arises from whether the question refers to the first complex (n=1) or the second (n=2).

Wait, the user question says: 'the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.' So 'dithiocyanato' implies two SCN, so n=2.

Then the correct answer is D (16.9%).

But looking back, the initial calculation suggests that the free Co²+ is 42.22%, n=1 is 37.998%, n=2 is 16.888%, and so on.

So the percentages:

Co²+: ~42.22%

n=1: ~38%

n=2: ~16.89%

n=3: ~0.265%

n=4: ~0.00675%.

So the sum is 42.22 +38 +16.89 +0.265 +0.00675= ~97.38%, which is less than 100%, but this is due to rounding errors.

So the correct percentage for n=2 is approximately 16.89%, which is 16.9% when rounded, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (total cobalt concentration = 0.01 M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co²⁺ and its complexes:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]
   \]

2. **Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constant for each complex is given by:  
   \[
   \beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]  
   Rearranging, the concentration of each complex is:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

3. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   Using the stability constants and the ligand concentration (\([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1\)), the denominator \(D\) is calculated as:  
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   D = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Free Co²⁺ Concentration**:  
   The free cobalt ion concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}}{D} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004222 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   Using the stability constants and the free Co²⁺ concentration, the concentrations of the complexes are calculated:  
   - For \([\text{Co(SCN)}]\):  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9(0.004222)(0.1) = 0.0037998 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]\):  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40(0.004222)(0.1)^2 = 0.0016888 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For \([\text{Co(SCN)}_3]\):  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63(0.004222)(0.1)^3 = 0.0002656 \, \text{M}
     \]
   - For \([\text{Co(SCN)}_4]\):  
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16(0.004222)(0.1)^4 = 0.000006755 \, \text{M}
     \]

6. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex**:  
   The blue dithiocyanato complex is \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^\circ\). Its fraction is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.0016888}{0.01} = 0.16888 \, \text{or} \, 16.89\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
