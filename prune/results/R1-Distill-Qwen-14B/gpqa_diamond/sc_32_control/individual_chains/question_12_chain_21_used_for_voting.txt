Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The masses given are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the principles of conservation of energy and momentum apply. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means the muon and the neutrino will have momenta with equal magnitude but opposite directions.

Let me think about the energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, right? Because neutrinos are leptons, but they're so light that for most practical purposes, their mass is negligible. So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, if the neutrino is massless, its rest mass energy is zero, so its energy is all kinetic. Or wait, no, actually, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in many problems, especially when the parent is at rest, we often assume neutrino is massless for simplicity, unless stated otherwise. So for this problem, maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless.

So the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV/c², and the neutrino has negligible mass.

Let me write down the conservation equations. 

Energy conservation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation:
p_pi = p_mu + p_nu

But p_pi is zero since the pion is at rest. So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of momentum of the muon, then the neutrino's momentum is p in the opposite direction, but when considering magnitudes, they are equal. So when squaring for energy, the signs go away.

So for the muon, its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c², but since units are in MeV, let's just consider E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 ) / c^2. Hmm, no, wait, the units might not be necessary if I'm considering everything in terms of MeV. Maybe it's better to work in units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p, since E_nu = |p_nu| c, but if c=1, E_nu = p.

Wait, no, if the neutrino is massless, then E_nu = p * c. But again, in units where c=1, E_nu = p. So in that case, E_nu = p.

So putting it all together:

Energy conservation: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

So,

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p

Hmm, solving for p. Let me rearrange this equation.

m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

Square both sides:

(m_pi - p)^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Expanding left side:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p = m_mu^2

Now, bring the 2 m_pi p term to the other side:

m_pi² - m_mu^2 = 2 m_pi p

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi)

Wait, that looks right. Let me compute that.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So,

(m_pi² - m_mu^2) = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2

Let me compute that.

Calculating 139.6 squared: 139.6 *139.6. Let me see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, but 139.6^2 is (139 +0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6². 139² is 19321. 2*139=278, 278 *0.6=166.8. 0.6²=0.36. So 19321 + 166.8 = 19487.8 +0.36=19488.16 MeV². Same as before.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and the cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2=10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that.

19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) = 8316, and 0.16 - 0.49 would be negative, so 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67? Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49)
= 8316 + (-0.33)
= 8315.67 MeV².

So numerator is 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * m_pi = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, but 29.8 is 0.2 less, so 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2) = 8376 - 55.84=8320.16. Hmm, but the numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less. So maybe around 29.8 MeV/c? Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 279.2 * x = 8315.67. So x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

First, approximate 279.2 * 29.8: 279.2 *30=8376, so 29.8 gives 8376 - (279.2 *0.2)=8376-55.84=8320.16. But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49= a bit less. So x ≈30 - (55.84/(279.2* something)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2*(30-0.2) = 8376-55.84=8320.16.

But 8315.67 is 8320.16 -4.49.

So the difference is 4.49 less than 29.8 *279.2.

So 29.8 - (4.49 /279.2) → 4.49/279.2≈0.016.

So x≈29.8 -0.016=29.784. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c. But wait, let me check with precise division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me see:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

But 8096.8 is less than 8315.67.

So 29 *279.2=8096.8.

Difference: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2= approximately 0.784.

So 29 + 0.784=29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, that's the momentum of the muon. So p_mu is about 29.784 MeV/c.

But wait, let me think. The neutrino's momentum is the same magnitude as the muon's, but opposite direction. So p_nu is also 29.784 MeV/c. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = p_nu c, but since c=1 in these units, E_nu = p_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Wait, no. Because in units where c=1, E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2). For neutrino, m=0, so E_nu = p_nu.

So E_mu is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Wait, let's compute that.

29.784^2≈ (30 -0.216)^2= 900 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216^2=900 - 12.96 + 0.046656≈887.086.

105.7^2=11172.49 as before.

So E_mu= sqrt(887.086 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu is about 109.81 MeV.

Now, from the energy conservation, E_nu = m_pi - E_mu =139.6 -109.81=29.79 MeV.

Which matches our earlier calculation of p_nu=29.784 MeV, so that seems consistent.

Now, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. But m_nu is zero (assuming), so KE_nu = E_nu=29.79 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the KE_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV, and KE_nu is 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use the principles of energy and momentum conservation. The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   Since the pion is at rest, \( E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\pi^+} = \vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_\nu
   \]
   The pion's momentum is zero (\( \vec{p}_{\pi^+} = 0 \)), so the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta are equal (\( p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu \)).

3. **Energy of the Muon**:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu
   \]
   (Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum.)

### Solving for Momentum:
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+}
\]
Rearranging and solving for \( p_{\mu^+} \):
\[
p_{\mu^+} = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
p_{\mu^+} = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]
Calculating:
\[
p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Muon Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino Energy**:
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_\nu = E_\nu - m_\nu = 29.78 - 0 = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
