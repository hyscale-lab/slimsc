Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. The question is about which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reaction steps. 

Hmm, let's break down the target molecule first. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, actually, numbering in benzene rings is a bit confusing. Let me visualize it. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent to each other. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, but wait, benzene is a ring, so substituents in 1,2,3 would be meta to each other? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the substituents' positions relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about each substituent's directing effect and the order in which they are introduced. For aromatic substitution reactions, activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors. 

The substituents here are ethoxy (which is an activating, ortho/para director), tert-butyl (a strong activating, ortho/para director since it's a bulky alkyl group), and nitro (a strong deactivating, meta director). Wait, no. Wait, nitro is a meta director because it's deactivating. But ethoxy is activating, so it's ortho/para. Tert-butyl is a bulky activating group, so ortho/para but tends to direct more to para because of steric hindrance, but in this case, maybe the substituent positions are such that each group is introduced in a certain order.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about their positions. If the ethoxy is at position 1, then where are the others? Let's imagine the benzene ring: numbering such that position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, they are all adjacent, which is a bit unusual because substituents are typically introduced in a way that each directs the next substitution appropriately.

Wait, maybe the order of substitution is important here. Let me consider that we might need to introduce the substituents in an order that allows each step to direct the next substitution correctly.

Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent. Nitro is a meta director. The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are ortho/para directors. So, when introducing substituents, the order will determine where each group goes.

The target structure is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at 3. That implies that position 1 is ethoxy, and the nitro is in the next position (position 3), while the tert-butyl is in between (position 2). So, perhaps the order of substitution is ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl? Or some other order.

Wait, no. Let me think about the steps needed. Starting from benzene, the first substituent will direct the next. So, perhaps the first substitution is ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl. Or maybe nitro is added after an ethoxy group.

Wait, nitro is a meta director. So if I first introduce ethoxy, which is activating, then the next substitution would be at the para position relative to ethoxy. But in the target, the nitro is adjacent to ethoxy, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced first, but that's a deactivating group, so subsequent substitutions would be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's see.

Wait, but in order to get all three substituents, I need to perform three substitution reactions. Each substitution introduces a new group, so the order of adding these groups will determine their positions.

Let's list the substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, positions 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, with substituents at adjacent positions. That's a bit unusual, as substituents are usually meta or para to each other when possible, but maybe in this case, they're all adjacent because of the order of addition.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the possible steps.

Option D: The steps are i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me think about each step.

Starting with benzene. Step i) is nitration with HNO3 and H2SO4. So first, we add a nitro group to benzene. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. Then step ii) is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing environment. Maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But in what context? Wait, after nitration, you have nitrobenzene. If you then treat with Fe and HCl, which is a typical conditions for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So now you have phenyl amine.

Wait, but phenyl amine is a strong activating group, ortho/para director.

Then step iii) is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. But after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is strongly activated. So, adding tert-butyl. In which position would that go?

If the ring has an amine group (which is ortho/para directing), the next substitution (tert-butyl) would likely go into either ortho or para positions relative to the amine. So, let's say we add the tert-butyl in the para position of the amine. Now, the ring has nitro group (from step i) in position 1, amine in position 4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with numbering.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch this. Let me imagine the benzene ring. After nitration, the nitro group is in position 1. Then, in step ii, itâ€™s reduced to an amine group (NH2) in position 1. Then, in step iii, we do Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Since the amine is a strong activating group, the new substituent (tert-butyl) will go either ortho or para to the amine. If the nitro was at position 1, then the amine is at position 1. So, adding in para would be position 4. Or ortho would be position 2 or 6.

Wait, but the target has substituents at 1,2, and 3. Hmm. If after nitro is added, it's at position 1, then after adding tert-butyl, it could be in position 3 (if meta to nitro), but wait no, because the amine is at position 1. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too confusing. Maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order of adding substituents is ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl. Let me see.

If I start with benzene, first add ethoxy group. Ethoxy is a strong activating group, so the next substitution would be ortho, meta, or para. But ethoxy is ortho/para director. Then, the next substituent would be nitro. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the ring becomes deactivating, which would affect where the next substituent goes.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the target, which has an ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, ethoxy is position 1, nitro is position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy?), but wait, positions 1 and 3 are meta on the benzene ring. So, if ethoxy is at position 1, then nitro at position 3 would be meta to it. So, if I first add ethoxy, then nitro in the meta position, then the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go into position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro. Hmm, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivating, so the next substitution (tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts) might be difficult because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro, ethoxy, tert-butyl. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, adding ethoxy (which is activating) would require some kind of substitution where the ring is deactivating. That might not be feasible because Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the nitro group is a meta director, so when it's added, the next substituent will go meta to it. So, if we have a nitro group, and then add ethoxy, the ethoxy would go meta to nitro, which would be position 3 if nitro is in position 1. Then, adding tert-butyl, which would be directed by the ethoxy group, possibly ortho or para.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about each substituent's directing effect.

Each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Activating groups (like ethoxy, tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

So, let's imagine the steps:

1. First substitution: let's say we add ethoxy. Then, the ring has an activating group, so next substitution can be ortho or para.

2. Second substitution: adding nitro. But nitro is a meta director. Wait, but how? Because after adding ethoxy, the next substitution (nitro) would be directed by ethoxy. So, nitro would be in ortho or para to ethoxy.

Wait, but in the target, nitro is next to ethoxy. So, if ethoxy is position 1, nitro is position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. But nitro is a meta director. Hmm, that's conflicting because after adding nitro, the next substituent would be directed by nitro as a meta director.

Wait, but if we have ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), which would be a bit difficult because nitro is deactivating. Then, adding tert-butyl, which is a bulky group, might go into position 3, which is meta to nitro.

But wait, let's think about the order. Suppose we first add ethoxy to benzene. Then, adding nitro in the ortho position (position 2) relative to ethoxy. But wait, adding nitro as the second substituent after ethoxy. Ethoxy is an activating group, so it directs the nitration to ortho or para. So, if we nitrate after ethoxy, the nitro group could be in position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). If we get nitro in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy, then the third substituent (tert-butyl) would be added next.

Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and nitro (2). The next substitution would be directed by the most influential group. Since nitro is deactivating, it's a meta director, while ethoxy is activating and ortho/para. So, where would the tert-butyl group go?

The next substituent would be directed by the existing groups. The ring has ethoxy (1) and nitro (2). The tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, so the position might be determined by the strongest director. Ethoxy is activating, so perhaps directing to ortho or para. But nitro is deactivating, so it would direct to meta. However, when multiple substituents are present, the substituents' directing effects can compete, and the position can be influenced by steric factors as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl would enter the position that is ortho to the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is in position 1, the ortho positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 is already occupied by nitro, so perhaps position 6. But in the target, the tert-butyl is in position 2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the order is nitro first. So, first nitration: nitro at position 1. Then, adding ethoxy in a position that's meta to nitro. Nitro is a meta director, so ethoxy would go into position 3 or 5. Then, adding tert-butyl, which would be directed by ethoxy in, say, position 4 (para to ethoxy) or position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). But in the target, the tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and nitro (position 3). Hmm, that might work.

Wait, let me imagine:

1. Nitration first: nitro at position 1.

2. Then, ethoxy. Since nitro is a meta director, ethoxy would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

3. Then, tert-butyl. Now, the substituents are nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). Ethoxy is an activating group, so it's ortho/para. The possible positions for tert-butyl are ortho or para to ethoxy. Ortho to ethoxy would be positions 2 and 4. Para would be position 6. But in the target, the tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy (3) and nitro (1). Wait, but that's possible if ethoxy is at position 3 and nitro at position 1. Then, adding tert-butyl in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 3) and meta to nitro. Hmm, maybe that's the case.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the steps in the options and see if any make sense.

Looking at the options, each option is a series of reactions. Let's go through each step in each option to see which sequence would lead to the target.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration â†’ benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction of nitro to amine â†’ nitrobenzene â†’ phenylamine (NH2) group.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, after step ii, the ring has an amine group (NH2) which is a strong activating group. So, the F-C alkylation would add tert-butyl in the ortho or para positions to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again. So adding another nitro group.

But wait, the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Let me think.

Wait, Option D's steps are: Nitration, reduction, alkylation, nitration again, then several steps. Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group. So perhaps this isn't the correct path. Alternatively, maybe some steps involve removing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps are for functional group interconversion. Let me see.

Wait, let me think. After step i: benzene â†’ nitrobenzene (position 1). Step ii: nitro is reduced to NH2 (phenylamine, position 1). Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So, the ring has NH2 (position 1). Adding tert-butyl would be in ortho (2) or para (4). So, if it goes ortho, position 2. Now, the substituents are NH2 (1) and C(CH3)3 (2). Then step iv: nitration again. Now, the ring has NH2 (1) and C(CH3)3 (2). Where would the nitro go? Nitration is directed by the most activating group. NH2 is a strong activating group, so it's ortho/para. The ring has substituents at 1 and 2. So, possible positions for nitration are 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the NH2 is at 1, the para is 4. Ortho would be 2 and 6. 2 is already occupied, so possible positions are 3,4,5,6. But which is more likely? Let me think: the NH2 group is in position 1, and the tert-butyl is at 2. So, the available positions are 3,4,5,6.

But the nitration is directed by NH2 (which is activating, ortho/para). So, the next nitro group would go to the para position relative to NH2, which is position 4. Or, if possible, ortho, but position 2 is already taken. So, nitro would go to 4. Now the ring has substituents at 1 (NH2), 2 (tert-butyl), and 4 (NO2). But our target has substituents at 1,2,3. So this doesn't match. Also, the target has ethoxy group. Hmm, so Option D's steps don't seem to include ethoxy introduction. Wait, step iii is Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which adds a tert-butyl group. But where is the ethoxy coming from? Oh, in step ix of option D, it's NaOH and EtBr. That's an ethoxy substitution. Wait, but when would that happen?

Wait, after step iv, which is nitration, the ring has NH2 (1), tert-butyl (2), and NO2 (4). Then step v: NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. But NH2 is at position 1; diazotization would form a diazonium salt. Then step vi: SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation. Hmm, not sure. Then step vii: dilute H2SO4. Step viii: H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis? Wait, perhaps a nitro group is involved.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should check another option.

Option B: Steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, benzene â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration. So, adding nitro group. Now, tert-butyl is an activating group (ortho/para), so nitration would add nitro in ortho or para. Let's say para, so nitro at position 4.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction of nitro to amine. So, nitro at 4 becomes NH2 at 4.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again. Now, the ring has NH2 (4), tert-butyl (1). Nitration would be directed by NH2, which is ortho/para. So, NH2 is at 4, possible nitration at 3 or 5 (ortho) or 1 (para, but 1 is already occupied by tert-butyl). So nitro could go to 3 or 5.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. NH2 would be converted to diazonium.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group? Or maybe something else. Or perhaps it's a Sandmeyer reaction, but without a copper salt, maybe it's just hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy group substitution. So, perhaps an SN2 reaction where a leaving group (like a bromide) is replaced by ethoxy. But when would that occur?

Wait, let me try to track this.

After step iv, the ring has tert-butyl (1), NH2 (4), and nitro (say, 3). Then step v: diazotization of NH2 (4) to form a diazonium salt. Step vi: H3O+ and heat â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium to hydroxyl group. So, position 4 becomes OH. Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's an example of an SN2 reaction where a good leaving group (like OH-) is replaced by EtO-? Wait, NaOH and EtBr would be an SN2 where Br- is a leaving group, but perhaps it's an alkoxy group substitution. Wait, but where is the leaving group?

Alternatively, maybe after step vi, we have a phenol group at position 4. Then, in step vii, NaOH and EtBr could perform an ethoxylation. But phenol is a strong activating group, but I'm not sure how that would work. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups and a good leaving group. Maybe the OH group is converted into a leaving group first.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction on a bromide. But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a bromide. But I don't see any step where a bromine is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy comes from a substitution of a nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via an O-alkylation after making a phenol. Let's see. Suppose after step vi, the ring has tert-butyl (1), nitro (3), and OH (4). Then, in step vii, NaOH and EtBr would deprotonate the OH to O- and then substitute with EtBr. So, OH â†’ OEt. So the substituents would be tert-butyl (1), nitro (3), and ethoxy (4). But the target has substituents at 1,2,3. So this would put ethoxy at 4, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps option B isn't the right one either.

Option C: Steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation. Sulfuric acid as catalyst. Sulfonation is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, adding a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration. Now, the ring has tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta). So, the nitration would be directed by the sulfonic acid group (since it's more deactivating?), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the tert-butyl is a stronger activating group, so nitration would be directed by it.

Wait, no. The sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when adding a nitro group in the presence of both, the nitration would likely occur at a position meta to the sulfonic acid group. But the tert-butyl is a bulky group, so steric factors may also play a role.

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs meta to the sulfonic acid. But this is getting complicated. Then step iv: Fe/HCl â†’ reduction of nitro to amine. 

Step v: NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. 

Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again. Hmm, not sure. 

Step vii: H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis. 

Step viii: dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe acid workup. 

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy substitution.

But this seems convoluted. I'm not seeing a clear path to the target structure.

Option A: Steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration. Activating group directs ortho/para. So nitro at position 2 or 4.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation. Adding a sulfonic acid group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again.

This also seems like many steps and I'm not seeing the target.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The ethoxy is an activating group, tert-butyl is also activating. Nitro is deactivating.

Since ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating, perhaps they are introduced early in the synthesis, before adding the nitro group. But nitro is a deactivating group, which complicates further substitution.

Wait, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's see.

1. Ethoxylation: benzene â†’ ethoxybenzene (anisole). Ethoxy is ortho/para director.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride â†’ adds tert-butyl in ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say para, so positions 1 (ethoxy) and 4 (tert-butyl). Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 4.

3. Nitration: directed by ethoxy (ortho/para). So possible positions are 2,4 (but 4 is taken), 6. So nitration could go to position 2 or 6. Let's say position 2. Now, substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 4 (tert-butyl), 2 (nitro).

But the target has substituents at 1,2,3. So that's position 1, 2, and 3. But in this scenario, substituents are at 1,2,4. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added in a position adjacent to ethoxy. So, if ethoxy is at 1, and nitro at 2, then tert-butyl would be added in which position? Let me think.

After ethoxy (1) and nitro (2), the next substitution would be directed by both. Ethoxy is activating, directs ortho/para. Nitro is deactivating, directs meta. So, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed by the strongest effect. Maybe it's directed by ethoxy, so ortho or para. Ortho to ethoxy (positions 2 and 6). Position 2 is already taken by nitro, so position 6. Or para to ethoxy, which is position 4. Alternatively, if directed by nitro, which is in position 2, then meta would be position 5.

But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2, which is already occupied by nitro. That doesn't work. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added after the tert-butyl group. Let me try that.

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

2. Ethoxylation â†’ add ethoxy group. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para director, ethoxy would go into ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para, position 4. Now substituents are 1 (tert-butyl) and 4 (ethoxy).

3. Nitration: directed by ethoxy (activating) â†’ ortho or para to ethoxy. So, ortho would be positions 3 and 5, para is position 1 (taken by tert-butyl). So nitro could go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Now substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (ethoxy). Wait, but the target is 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in different positions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me consider each option's steps again, focusing on whether they can produce the target.

Looking again at Option D: steps are nitration, reduction, alkylation, nitration, etc. But the target has only one nitro group. So, perhaps in Option D, after the first nitration, the ring has nitro (1). Then reduced to NH2 (1). Then alkylation adds tert-butyl (2). Then, another nitration adds nitro in position 4. Then, steps involving diazotization and sulfonation. But the target doesn't have a nitro in position 4, it has nitro in 3.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is nitration first, then ethoxylation, then alkylation. Let me see.

After nitration, the ring has nitro (1). Then, ethoxylation would be directed by nitro (meta), so ethoxy at 3 or 5. Then, alkylation would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para to it). So, tert-butyl could go to 2 (ortho to ethoxy) or 4 (para to ethoxy). If it goes to 2, then the substituents are 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy), and 2 (tert-butyl). But in the target, the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, if nitro is at 1, ethoxy at 3, tert-butyl at 2, that would be the same as the target. Wait, but in that scenario, the nitro is at 1, which is ethoxy's meta position. So, how would that happen?

Wait, the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, perhaps the order is nitro, ethoxy, tert-butyl.

But when I add nitro first, then ethoxy would be at meta to nitro, which is 3 or 5. Then, adding tert-butyl would be ortho to ethoxy (positions 2 or 4). So, if ethoxy is at 3, then tert-butyl could be at 2 or 4. If it's at 2, that would make substituents at 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl). Which is the same as the target. Wait, but in that case, the numbering would be different. Let me think again.

If benzene is first nitrated at position 1. Then, ethoxy is added at position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, tert-butyl is added at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy at 3). So, substituents are 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl). But the target is 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). Hmm, so this would be meta-nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3. So, perhaps the numbering is different based on the substituents' priority?

Wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. The priority order is based on alphabetical order. Let me see: 'ethoxy' (O), 'nitro' (N), 'tert-butyl' (C). Wait, alphabetical order is C comes before N, which comes before O. So, tert-butyl would have the lowest number, then nitro, then ethoxy. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, substituent priorities are determined by the first atom's atomic number. So, O (ethoxy) has higher priority than N (nitro) and C (tert-butyl). Wait, no, the first atom in the substituent determines priority. So, ethoxy (O) is higher than nitro (N) which is higher than tert-butyl (C).

So, the substituent with the highest priority (ethoxy) gets the lowest number. So, in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. Then, the next highest priority is nitro, so it should get the next lowest number. But in the target, nitro is at position 3. Hmm, that might not align. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are numbered to give the lowest sum.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's get back to the reaction steps.

In the target molecule, the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, their positions are adjacent to each other.

If I go back to the options, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the number of nitration steps. The target has one nitro group, so any option that involves multiple nitrations might not be correct. Option D, for example, has step i and iv as nitration, which would add two nitro groups. But the target has only one, so that's a problem.

Looking at Option B: steps ii and iv are nitrations. So, it would add two nitro groups. That's not correct for the target.

Option C: step iii is nitration, step vi is nitration again. So, two nitro groups. Not matching.

Option A: step ii is nitration, step ix is nitration. So again, two nitro groups. But target has one.

Wait, this suggests that the correct option should have only one nitration step. None of the options have only one nitration. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps one of the nitration steps is used to convert a nitro group elsewhere. Or perhaps a nitro group is reduced and then another nitration occurs.

Wait, looking at Option B: steps ii (nitration), iv (nitration), and then steps involving diazotization and others. But that would lead to two nitro groups. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is the one where the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps in Option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration: benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction: nitro â†’ NH2 (phenylamine).

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adding tert-butyl to NH2.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again: adding another nitro group.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So, steps i and iv would introduce two nitro groups, which is incorrect. So, Option D is out.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B: steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts â†’ tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration: tert-butyl directs ortho/para. Let's say nitro at position 4 (para to tert-butyl).

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction: nitro â†’ NH2 at position 4.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration again: NH2 directs ortho/para. So, possible positions 3 or 5 (ortho) or 1 (para, but taken by tert-butyl). Let's say nitro goes to position 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization of NH2 (4) â†’ diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium to phenol (OH at position 4).

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy group substitution. Maybe this is an SN2 reaction where OH is replaced by OEt.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation, but that's after ethoxy is added. Hmm.

Wait, after step vii, the substituents would be tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), ethoxy (4). Wait, no, because the NH2 was at 4, which is converted to OH, then to OEt. So substituent at 4 is now ethoxy. Substituents at 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (ethoxy). 

But the target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think again.

After step iv, the ring has tert-butyl (1), nitro (4), and another nitro (3). Wait, no, step iv in option B is a second nitration. So, after step iii, the ring has tert-butyl (1) and NH2 (4). Then, nitration in step iv adds nitro to position 3 (ortho to NH2).

So, substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 4 (NH2), 3 (nitro).

Then step v: diazotization of NH2 (4) â†’ diazonium.

Step vi: hydrolysis â†’ OH at 4.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr â†’ OEt at 4.

So, substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4 (OEt). 

But the target has substituents at 1 (OEt), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So this isn't matching.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are numbered in a way that the substituents are arranged differently. Let me imagine the ring:

Positions:

1: tert-butyl

3: nitro

4: ethoxy.

But the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, this doesn't align.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think about the correct order of substitution.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, the positions are adjacent. So, the substituents are 1, 2, 3 in order.

The nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). Since nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group, it must have been introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, because after nitro is added, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitution difficult.

Wait, but the tert-butyl group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. So, if nitro is present, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, nitro must be introduced last, after ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation: benzene â†’ ethoxybenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: ethoxybenzene + tert-butyl chloride â†’ 2-(tert-butyl)-ethoxybenzene (positions 1 and 2).

3. Nitration: nitro group added at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl (position 2). But wait, nitro is a meta director, so if tert-butyl is at position 2, then nitration would be at position 5 (meta to tert-butyl). But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Hmm, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl, but how? Because after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two activating groups, so nitration would be directed by the strongest activating group. Ethoxy is a better activating group than tert-butyl, so nitro would be added ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ethoxy is at position 1. So, para would be position 4, ortho positions 2 and 6. Position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl, so nitro could be at position 6 or 4. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl. So, this doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the nitro is added via some other directing effect. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added using a different method, like using a directing group that's already present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group. But that would require the ring to be activated again after being deactivating, which is not straightforward, because nitro groups deactivate the ring.

Wait, maybe the nitro is introduced as a substituent that's later modified. For example, introducing nitro and then converting it into a better leaving group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitration first, then ethoxylation, then alkylation. Let me think again.

If nitration is done first, nitro at position 1. Then, ethoxy is added in a meta position (position 3). Then, alkylation adds tert-butyl in ortho to ethoxy (position 2). So substituents are 1 (nitro), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (ethoxy). But the target has 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are in the same positions but in a different order. But since the target's substituent priorities are O (ethoxy) > N (nitro) > C (tert-butyl), the numbering would start with ethoxy as position 1, nitro as 3, and tert-butyl as 2.

So, the correct order would be nitration (nitro at 1), then ethoxylation (ethoxy at 3), then alkylation (tert-butyl at 2). This would give the substituents in the correct positions.

Now, looking at the options to see which sequence does this.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction â†’ NH2 at 1.

iii) Alkylation â†’ tert-butyl at 2 (since NH2 is activating, ortho/para).

iv) Nitration â†’ another nitro at 4.

But the target only has one nitro, so this can't be right.

Option B:

i) Alkylation â†’ tert-butyl at 1.

ii) Nitration â†’ nitro at 4 (para to tert-butyl).

iii) Reduction â†’ NH2 at 4.

iv) Nitration â†’ nitro at 3 (ortho to NH2).

v) Diazotization â†’ NH2 at 4 becomes N2+.

vi) Hydrolysis â†’ OH at 4.

vii) Ethoxylation â†’ OEt at 4.

So substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4 (ethoxy). But the target has substituents 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, this doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that after nitration, the ethoxy group is introduced in a way that directs the tert-butyl to the correct position.

Alternatively, let me consider Option A.

Option A steps:

i) Alkylation â†’ tert-butyl at 1.

ii) Nitration â†’ nitro at 2 or 4.

Assuming nitro at 2.

iii) Sulfonation â†’ sulfonic acid at, say, position 4.

iv) Diazotization â†’ NH2 somewhere.

v) Dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat.

vii) NaOH, EtBr â†’ ethoxy substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduction.

ix) Nitration â†’ another nitro.

This seems to have multiple steps, but I'm not seeing the correct substituent positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that first adds ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's see.

Looking for an option that starts with ethoxylation, then alkylation, then nitration.

But looking at the options, none of them start with ethoxylation. They all start with either nitration or alkylation.

Wait, option C starts with alkylation, then sulfonation, then nitration. So, not ethoxylation first.

Hmm. Another approach: the target has ethoxy group, which is an OCH2CH3 group. This could be introduced via an alkoxy group substitution. So, perhaps after making a bromide or another leaving group, an ethoxy group can be introduced.

Wait, looking at option B's step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's a typical condition for an SN2 substitution where a bromide is replaced by ethoxy. So, perhaps a bromine is introduced, then replaced by ethoxy.

But how would that bromine be introduced? Maybe via a benzene ring with a substituent that can be converted into a bromide.

Wait, in option B, after step iv, the ring has NH2 (4), tert-butyl (1), and nitro (3). Then, step v: diazotization of NH2 (4) â†’ N2+ at 4. Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis to OH at 4. Step vii: NaOH and EtBr â†’ ethoxy at 4. So substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4 (ethoxy). Which doesn't match the target.

Wait, unless the numbering is different. If the ring is numbered such that ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, but in the option B scenario, substituents are at 1,3,4. So, the numbering doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but the substituents are arranged differently.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Based on the target structure, the correct order is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. So, looking for an option that nitrates first, then ethoxylation, then alkylation.

Looking at the options, which option has nitration first, then ethoxylation, then alkylation?

Option D: Nitration first, then reduction, alkylation, nitration again. Not matching.

Option B: Alkylation first, then nitration, reduction, nitration again. No.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options directly match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, despite the confusion.

Wait, another angle: the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, after ethoxylation, the next substitution would be tert-butyl (ortho to ethoxy), then nitro in position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl and ortho to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, making further substitutions difficult. So, in that case, nitro would have to be introduced last, but I don't see how that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced in a position that's directed by both ethoxy and tert-butyl. Since ethoxy is activating and directs ortho/para, and tert-butyl is activating and directs ortho/para, the nitro would go in a position that's ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

In this case, nitro would be at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl (position 2).

So, the sequence would be ethoxylation, alkylation, nitration.

Looking for an option that does ethoxylation, then alkylation, then nitration. But none of the options start with ethoxylation.

Wait, perhaps in the options, the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after some leaving group is created. For example, introducing a nitro group, then converting it into a good leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

Let me think about option B again.

Option B:

i) Alkylation â†’ tert-butyl at 1.

ii) Nitration â†’ nitro at 4.

iii) Reduction â†’ NH2 at 4.

iv) Nitration â†’ nitro at 3.

v) Diazotization â†’ NH2 at 4 â†’ N2+.

vi) Hydrolysis â†’ OH at 4.

vii) NaOH, EtBr â†’ OEt at 4.

So, substituents are 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4 (ethoxy).

But the target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, substituents are in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is done such that the substituents are in the correct positions. Maybe in option B, after all steps, the substituents end up in the target positions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the ring after all steps in option B.

After step vii: substituents are at 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (ethoxy).

If we number the ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl would be at position 4, and nitro at 2. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering starts with the substituent with the highest priority. Ethoxy has the highest priority, so it's at position 1. Then, the next substituent is nitro, which would be at position 2. Then, tert-butyl at position 3. But in option B, substituents are at 1,3,4. So, it's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct option is B, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are all adjacent. The ethoxy directs the next substitution to ortho (position 2) where tert-butyl is added. Then, the next substitution is nitro, which is directed by tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, it directs ortho/para. The only available position adjacent (ortho) would be position 3, which is also meta to the ethoxy. Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, which is meta to tert-butyl.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Considering all the steps, the correct sequence would involve nitrating first, then ethoxylation, then alkylation. But I can't find an option that does this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, because after multiple steps, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Wait, another angle: the target has an ethoxy group, which is likely introduced via an SN2 substitution, such as using NaOH and EtBr. Which step in the options does that? It's in option B's step vii: NaOH and EtBr.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation (tert-butyl) â†’ position 1.

2. Nitration â†’ position 4.

3. Reduction â†’ NH2 at 4.

4. Nitration â†’ position 3.

5. Diazotization â†’ NH2 at 4 â†’ diazonium.

6. Hydrolysis â†’ OH at 4.

7. SN2 substitution â†’ OEt at 4.

This would give substituents at 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4 (OEt). But the target is 1 (OEt), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, perhaps the numbering is such that OEt is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, let me draw it out:

Positions:

1: OEt

2: t-Bu

3: NO2

But in option B's scenario, substituents are at 1 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2), 4 (OEt). So, this would require the ring to be rotated so that OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3. But that's a different arrangement, which might not be possible given the substituents' positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is done based on the substituent priorities and their positions. So, the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the analysis involves understanding the directing effects of substituents and the sequence of reactions required to achieve the target structure. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other. The synthesis must account for the activating and deactivating nature of these groups and their directing effects.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituent Directing Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy (OCH2CH3)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl (C(CH3)3)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing (but sterically hindered, favoring para).
   - **Nitro (NO2)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Target Structure**:
   - Ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. These substituents are adjacent, which is unusual due to steric and electronic effects.

3. **Reaction Sequence**:
   - The synthesis must involve three substitution reactions: introduction of ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in the correct order to achieve the desired positions.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Steps: tert-butyl alkylation â†’ nitration â†’ sulfonation â†’ diazotization â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxylation â†’ nitration.
- This sequence introduces multiple nitro groups and does not align with the target structure, as it results in more than one nitro substituent. Additionally, the timing of ethoxylation is incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
- Steps: tert-butyl alkylation â†’ nitration â†’ reduction â†’ nitration â†’ diazotization â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxylation.
- This sequence starts with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration and reduction. The second nitration introduces a nitro group, and subsequent steps introduce an ethoxy group. However, the substituents end up at positions 1 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), and 4 (ethoxy), which does not match the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
- Steps: tert-butyl alkylation â†’ sulfonation â†’ nitration â†’ reduction â†’ diazotization â†’ nitration â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxylation.
- This sequence introduces sulfonation early, which is a deactivating group. The subsequent reactions do not lead to the correct positions for the substituents in the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
- Steps: Nitration â†’ reduction â†’ tert-butyl alkylation â†’ nitration â†’ diazotization â†’ sulfonation â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxylation.
- This sequence introduces two nitro groups (via steps i and iv), which is inconsistent with the target structure. Additionally, the timing of ethoxylation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly match the target structure. However, **Option B** comes closest, as it introduces the substituents in a logical order (tert-butyl, nitro, ethoxy) and aligns most closely with the required positions, despite some discrepancies in the final arrangement. The reasoning suggests that Option B is the most plausible choice.

Answer: B
