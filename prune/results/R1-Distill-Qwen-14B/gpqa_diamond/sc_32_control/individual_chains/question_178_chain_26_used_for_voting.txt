Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum field theory. But I'll take it step by step. The question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me see what I remember.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, right. So σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh wait, I remember that σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which I think is from a gauge field, like electromagnetism or non-Abelian fields.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify what F is. Oh wait, but the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like in electromagnetism, has dimensions. Let me think: in 4-dimensional spacetime, the field strength F_{μν} has mass dimension 2, right? Because the field A_mu has dimension 1, and F is the derivative of A plus terms, so each derivative brings a dimension of 1, and each A is dimension 1, so F is like ∂A which is dimension 2.

Now, the Lagrangian is an interaction term, so we have to make sure that each term in the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, let's break down the dimensions of each component.

First, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is the same as ψ, right? Because it's the adjoint, but dimension-wise, same.

σ_{μν} is made from [γ matrices], which are dimensionless. Because the gamma matrices are just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ, γ], which is zero. So the sigma term doesn't contribute any dimension.

So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. Then, F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the term is κ multiplied by (3) * (2) = 6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ would be 3. Then σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so σ ψ̄ ψ would still be 3. Then F is 2. So the product is 3 + 2 =5. So the entire term is κ multiplied by something of dimension 5. Because 3 (from ψ̄ψ) plus 2 (from F) is 5. Wait, but wait—no. Because it's multiplied together, not added. Wait, no, because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product of the fields must have dimension 4, and the coupling constant will adjust that.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So each term in L must have [mass]^4. So for the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, let's compute the dimension.

ψ̄ has [3/2], ψ has [3/2], so ψ̄ ψ is 3. σ is dimensionless, so that's still 3. F has [2]. So the product is 3 * 2 = 5. So the term is κ multiplied by something of dimension 5. So for the entire term to have dimension 4, κ must make up the difference. So [κ] must be [mass]^(4 -5) = [mass]^-1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term must have dimension 4. The term is κ multiplied by the product (ψ̄ σ ψ F). The product has dimension (3/2 +3/2) for the ψ terms, which is 3, and F has 2, so 3 * 2 = 6? Or wait, actually, the product is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Since each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 =3 (since σ is dimensionless). Then F is dimension 2. So the product is 3 * 2 =6? Wait, no. Because the product is (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by F. So each is multiplied, so the total dimension is 3 +2 =5. So the term is κ * (something with dimension 5). So to get the term to dimension 4, κ must be dimension -1, because 5 + (-1) =4.

Yes, so [κ] must be -1. So that answers the first question.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero). Because couplings with negative mass dimension are super-renormalizable, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the rule is that for a theory in 4 dimensions, a coupling with positive mass dimension would make the theory non-renormalizable because it would require an infinite number of counterterms, I think.

Wait, no, wait: The mass dimension of the coupling tells us about renormalizability. The general rule is that a coupling with negative mass dimension would lead to a super-renormalizable theory, because the interaction terms have higher dimensions, leading to less divergences. Wait, no, wait: Let me think.

In 4 dimensions, the mass dimension of the coupling in a term L ~ g φ^n would have [g] = d - (n × [φ]). Each field φ has a certain dimension. For the term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have [g] ≥ 0. If [g] <0, then the theory is super-renormalizable because the interaction is "weaker" at high energies. If [g] >0, the theory is non-renormalizable, because the coupling becomes stronger at high energies, requiring an infinite number of counterterms.

Wait, but wait, in this case, our coupling κ has dimension -1. So [κ] = -1. So it's negative, which implies the theory is super-renormalizable. But wait, the question is asking if the theory is renormalizable. So super-renormalizable is a subset of renormalizable theories, or is it that super-renormalizable is a different category?

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it wrong. Let me get this straight. Renormalizable theories are those where all the couplings have non-negative mass dimensions (including zero). If any coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable. Because in super-renormalizable theories, the number of divergences is finite, so you can handle them with a finite number of counterterms.

In non-renormalizable theories, the couplings have positive mass dimensions, leading to an infinite number of divergences, requiring infinitely many counterterms, hence not renormalizable in the conventional sense.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling in a term L ~ g φ^n is [g] = D - (n × [φ]), where D is the spacetime dimension. For 4D, D=4.

For a term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥ 0. So if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable. No, wait, no. Because if [g] is negative, the term is allowed in a renormalizable theory only if [g] ≥ 0. So if the coupling has [g] <0, the term is non-renormalizable. Wait, I might be mixing up.

Wait, no. Let me think of specific examples. For example, in φ^4 theory: [φ] =1, so [g] =4 - 4*1=0. So [g] is 0, which is allowed, so the theory is renormalizable. For φ^3 theory in 4D: [g] =4 -3*1=1>0. So the coupling has positive mass dimension, which makes the theory non-renormalizable. Because higher energy scales would require higher-order terms, leading to infinite terms.

Wait, but in our case, the coupling κ has [κ] = -1. So [κ] is negative. So that would imply that the term is super-renormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension. So the interaction term is allowed in a renormalizable theory? Or does it mean the theory is super-renormalizable, which is a subset of renormalizable?

Wait, I think I need to clarify: Renormalizable theories are those where all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. If a coupling has a negative mass dimension, the term would be non-renormalizable because the interaction becomes relevant at lower energies. Wait, no. Alternatively, the other way around: If a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction is more relevant, making the theory super-renormalizable because the interactions are weaker at high energies. So the theory can have only a finite number of divergences.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of power counting. The general rule is that the mass dimension of the coupling [g] must be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because if [g] is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable because the term has a higher dimension, leading to more divergent Feynman diagrams at higher orders. Wait, no, that's not right. Because higher dimension terms have lower dimension couplings.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the interaction term, the dimension of the coupling [g] must be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable as it would require higher powers of momentum in the propagator or vertices, leading to more divergent integrals, which cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: The superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram is given by D = d - (vertices × (each coupling's dimension) ) + ... (I might be mixing the exact formula).

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated as D = d L - (sum over each vertex (n_i * [g_i])), where L is the number of loops, and n_i is the number of lines attached to the vertex for coupling g_i.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler way is to think: each vertex contributes a certain number of dimensions based on the coupling.

In our case, the interaction term is L ~ κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each vertex would have 4 fields: ψ, ψ, F, F? Wait, no. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each vertex connects two ψ lines and two F lines? Wait, no, because ψ̄ is one ψ and F^{μν} is a field for the gauge field. Wait, maybe each vertex connects two ψ lines and two photons (or gauge bosons) lines. Because F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which is like two derivatives of the gauge field, but the vertex would have two ψ lines and two A lines (if it's an electromagnetic interaction, for example).

Wait, but F^{μν} is a field strength, not the gauge field itself. Hmm, but in the Lagrangian, when we have terms like ψ̄ σ F ψ, it's a four-point vertex where two are Dirac spinors and two are derivatives of the gauge field. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each vertex is a ψ, ψ, A, A interaction. Because F is made from A. So each vertex would have two ψs and two As. So each vertex has four legs: 2 ψ and 2 A.

But regardless, the main point is to determine whether the theory is renormalizable based on the coupling's dimension.

So, we determined that [κ] is -1. So [κ] is negative. So the coupling has mass dimension -1.

In 4D, a coupling with [g] <0 means that the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because, for example, in φ^4 theory, [g] is 0, which is allowed. For φ^3, [g] is 1, which is not allowed, so the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait: For a term like L = g φ^n, the condition for renormalizability is [g] ≥ 0. So if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable. Because the term has a higher dimension, making the interaction weaker at low energies. So the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms because the coupling becomes relevant at high energies (or the dimensionless coupling grows with energy). Hence, non-renormalizable.

Wait, but in our case, the coupling has [κ] = -1. So it's negative. So that would make the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because some sources say that a coupling with negative mass dimension implies super-renormalizable. Let me think about the standard model. In QED, the interaction is L = e ψ̄ A ψ. The dimension of e is [mass]^0, because ψ has dimension 3/2, A has dimension 1. So the interaction term has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 4, which is correct. So [e] must be 0 because the term must have dimension 4. So e is dimensionless. Hence, QED is renormalizable.

Wait, in our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So the interaction term is dimension 4 because [κ] is -1, and the rest (ψ̄ σ ψ F) is dimension 5, so the product is (-1 +5)=4.

So, in terms of renormalizability, the coupling's dimension is negative, which, as I thought earlier, might imply that the term is non-renormalizable. But wait, no, because QED has a dimensionless coupling (e) and is renormalizable. So according to the standard, if the coupling has dimension ≤0, the theory is renormalizable. Or is it [g] ≥0?

Wait, maybe I've got it mixed up. Let me think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a diagram with V vertices, each vertex contributes a certain dimension. The superficial degree of divergence is D = d V - (sum over each vertex (n_i [g_i])) ), where n_i is the number of lines at that vertex.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For a theory to be renormalizable, all the divergences must be absorbed into the existing fields and couplings, without the need for introducing an infinite number of new terms.

In our case, the coupling has negative mass dimension, which implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension. So higher-dimensional terms usually lead to super-renormalizable theories because higher-dimension operators are less relevant, leading to fewer divergences.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the renormalizability conditions. The general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. If any coupling has negative dimension, the theory is either non-renormalizable or super-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct condition is that all couplings must have non-negative mass dimension for the theory to be renormalizable. So if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. But wait, I think this is not correct.

Wait, I think the opposite is true. That if a coupling has positive mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because the interaction becomes more significant at higher energies. Whereas if the coupling is dimensionless ([g]=0) or negative ([g]<0), the theory is renormalizable, because the interaction is either marginal or irrelevant, leading to finite or manageable divergences.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of loops that can lead to divergences. If a coupling has negative dimension, the number of loops that can cause divergences is limited, making the theory super-renormalizable. Because each loop brings in a factor of the energy scale, and with a negative dimension coupling, the divergences would be tamed.

So, for example, in φ^3 theory in 6 dimensions, [g] =6 -3*(1) =3>0, so the coupling is relevant, leading to a non-renormalizable theory. But in 4 dimensions, [g]=4-3=1>0, so again, non-renormalizable.

In our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So it would imply that the theory is super-renormalizable, which is a subset of renormalizable theories. Because the interaction is of higher dimension, the theory is not as bad as non-renormalizable, but it's not the most standard case.

Wait, but I'm getting myself tangled. Let me try to look up the standard criteria. So, according to my notes, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension less than or equal to that of the spacetime dimension (d). Wait, no, more accurately, in d dimensions, a coupling g in a term g φ^n must satisfy [g] = d - n [φ]. For the theory to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0.

Wait, no, wait. The correct condition is that [g] ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable. Because you can't have a finite number of counterterms. So in our case, [κ]=-1, which is less than zero. So the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting more confused now. Because I remember that in effective field theories, higher-dimensional operators (with negative coupling dimensions) are included, and these are non-renormalizable but can be used at low energies.

Hmm. So if [g] <0, the term is non-renormalizable because it's a higher-dimension operator. Thus, the theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term in our Lagrangian is dimension 4, because the coupling's dimension is -1, and the rest is dimension 5. So 5 -1 =4. So the term is part of a renormalizable theory? Or not?

No, wait, the dimension of the term is 4, which is correct for a Lagrangian. But it's the dimension of the coupling that determines the renormalizability. So if [g] is negative, then the term is non-renormalizable, but if it's positive, it's non-renormalizable, and if it's zero, it's renormalizable.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. No, a term with [g] <0 is non-renormalizable. Because in such case, the term is a higher-dimension operator, which only makes sense as an effective theory. So our term has [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: [κ]=-1, which makes the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Another perspective: The number of possible divergent diagrams depends on the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, the Feynman diagrams can only have a finite number of divergences because each vertex would contribute a negative power of the momentum, limiting the possible loop divergences.

So, for example, in scalar φ^3 theory in 4D, [g]=1. The coupling is positive, so the theory is non-renormalizable because each vertex would contribute a momentum factor that, when integrated, could lead to higher and higher degree divergences, requiring infinite counterterms.

But if [g] is negative, each vertex would contribute a lower power, leading to only a finite number of possible divergent diagrams. Hence, the theory is super-renormalizable, meaning it's renormalizable but requires fewer counterterms than a renormalizable theory.

But wait, according to some sources, a theory is super-renormalizable if the coupling has negative mass dimension. Because the interaction is of higher dimension, making it irrelevant at high energies, leading to a finite number of divergences.

So in our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative, so the theory is super-renormalizable, which is a subset of renormalizable. Because super-renormalizable theories are renormalizable, but they require fewer counterterms.

Wait, but the question is phrased as, "is the theory renormalizable?" So if it's super-renormalizable, the answer would be yes. Because super-renormalizable theories are a subset of renormalizable theories. So the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me think again.

Renormalizable theories are those for which the interaction terms have couplings with mass dimension ≥0. If any coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. Because the term would be an effective interaction, valid only at low energies.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, no, no. Because if [g] is negative, the term is a higher-dimension operator, which is part of an effective theory. Such terms are non-renormalizable. Because they require an infinite number of terms to be included when considering high energies.

So, for example, Fermi's theory of the four-fermion interaction has [g] = -2 in 4D. Because the interaction term is ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ, which has four ψ fields. Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so total is 6. So the term must have dimension 4, so [g] =4 -6= -2. Thus, the theory is non-renormalizable because [g] is negative.

So in our problem, because [κ]=-1, the term would have a negative dimension coupling, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the Standard Model, some terms have negative coupling dimensions but are still considered renormalizable. Or is that not the case?

Wait, perhaps no, because the SM is renormalizable because all couplings are dimensionless or have positive dimensions. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Wait, in the electroweak theory, the Higgs potential is V(φ)=λ (φ^2 - v^2)^2. The coupling λ has [λ] =4 -2*( [φ] ) =4 - 2*(1)=2. So [λ]=2, which is positive, making the theory non-renormalizable. Wait, but that's not correct because the Higgs is a renormalizable theory.

Wait, no, wait. The Higgs field φ has dimension (mass)^1 in 4D. So the term (φ^2) has dimension 2, so the term (φ^2 -v^2)^2 would be (2) + (2) =4. The coupling λ would have dimension [λ] =4 -4 (from the four φ fields) =0. So λ is dimensionless. Hence, the theory is renormalizable.

Ah, right. I see where I was getting confused earlier. So for each term, the coupling's dimension is determined by subtracting the sum of the fields' dimensions from the needed dimension for the Lagrangian.

So in our problem, the coupling κ has [κ]=-1. So the interaction term is dimension 4, as required. But the negative dimension of κ means that the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, how? Because in the Higgs example, the coupling was dimensionless, which is okay. So if a coupling is negative, such as [κ]=-1, the term is non-renormalizable.

So, to summarize, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. So looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, because [κ] is -1.

Option C is correct.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\) and \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime. Each term in the Lagrangian must also have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the dimensions of the components:

- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}\). Since \(\bar{\psi}\) is the adjoint of \(\psi\), it also has \([ \bar{\psi} ] = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 2\).
- The operator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices \(\gamma_\mu\), so it is dimensionless: \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] = 0\).

The product \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi\) has mass dimension:
\[
[ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi ] = [ \bar{\psi} ] + [ \psi ] + [ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 = 3.
\]
Including \(F^{\mu\nu}\), the full term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension:
\[
[ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ] = [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi ] + [ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the entire term has mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must have mass dimension:
\[
[ \kappa ] = 4 - [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} ] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension (\([g] \geq 0\)). If a coupling has a negative mass dimension (\([g] < 0\)), the interaction term is of higher dimension and the theory is **not renormalizable**. Such terms typically arise in effective field theories and require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

In this case, the coupling \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
