Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to determine how many possible organic products are formed.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait, the 'd' here is probably a typo. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Hmm, no, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 'd' could be a lowercase 'm' or another letter. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? But the question isn't clear. Wait, actually, looking back, maybe the 'd' is a mistake. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, but maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene? No, wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which probably means 2-dimethyl groups or something else. Wait, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl groups. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 4 positions. That would make sense, perhaps.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and a good deprotonating agent. In aromatic substitution reactions, especially under such basic conditions, it's likely an elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, such as a benzene ring with a substituent that has a triple bond or a double bond.

Wait, another possibility is that the bromide leaves, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond, perhaps leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Or wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in aromatic systems, when you have a leaving group like bromine and another substituent, under strong base conditions (like NaNH2 in ammonia), you might be looking at a dehydrohalogenation, which would form a triple bond. Because, I think, when you have a benzene ring with a substituent that can lose H and Br, you can form a benzyne intermediate, but perhaps in this case, the substituents might direct the elimination in a certain way.

Alternatively, considering the structure 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene: the positions 2 and 4 are both methyl groups. So the bromine is at position 1. So the benzene ring has methyl at 2 and 4 positions, and bromine at 1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to elimination of H and Br, forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (but wait, that's adjacent to the methyl groups). Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a triple bond or a double bond, removing H and Br.

Wait, elimination reactions typically form either alkenes or alkynes. In this case, since the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative, the elimination would presumably form a triple bond, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond (like benzyne). But wait, benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So when the base (NaNH2) is added, it might abstract a beta-hydrogen. Let's see: the bromine is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group. So the hydrogen that can be abstracted would be at position 6 (if any) or maybe position 4 or another position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 has a methyl group. Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine. Then, elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Wait, but position 2 is already substituted with a methyl. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination is possible between the bromine and another position. Wait, maybe the bromine is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at 2 and 4. So, the positions adjacent to the bromine are 2 and 6. Position 2 is occupied by a methyl, so perhaps the hydrogen is abstracted from position 6, leading to elimination across 1 and 6, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. Wait, but then the ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's a meta position relative to the methyl groups?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If bromine is at position 1, then the positions are numbered 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 3, 4 (CH3), 5, and 6. So the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl, position 6 is H maybe?

So, the base (NaNH2) would abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine. So, possible positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl, so the only possible beta-hydrogen is at position 6. So the base would abstract the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so eliminating H and Br would form a triple bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no—actually, elimination removes H from adjacent to the leaving group. So if Br is at 1, the beta hydrogens are at 2 and 6. Since position 2 is a methyl (no H), the only H available is at position 6. So the base takes H from position 6, and Br leaves, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. But wait, that would make the triple bond between 1 and 6. But in a benzene ring, that's two positions away from position 2's methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a triple bond between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a methyl, which might prevent that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't go via elimination but via another pathway. Wait, another possibility is that the base could abstract a proton alpha to the bromine, leading to a benzyl carbanion, which then could undergo some reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a bromide is attached to a benzene ring, and treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it could lead to a dehydrohalogenation, forming a ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's more with AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products. If the bromide leaves, and a proton is abstracted, then we form a triple bond. So the product would be 1-ynesomething. Wait, no, the benzene ring would have a triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzannulene or a benzyne. Benzyne is a diradical intermediate that's highly strained but can undergo various reactions. But in this case, the reaction is in ammonia, which is a good nucleophile.

Wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and after elimination, the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2, but wait, position 2 has a methyl group. Hmm, that's a problem because the triple bond requires a sp-hybridized carbon, which can't have a methyl group attached. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination is between positions 1 and 6, but position 6 is a hydrogen. So, eliminating H from 6 and Br from 1 would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But then, the ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a structure where positions 2 and 4 are methyl groups. That might lead to a meta arrangement.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the actual possibility of that structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's deprotonated. But that would likely form a phenide ion, which might not be a stable product under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, making a compound like 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-didehydrobenzene (but I'm not sure if that's possible). Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2, but the methyl at position 2 would be in the way.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't possible in this case because the necessary hydrogen isn't available. If the bromine is at position 1, and the adjacent positions 2 and 6 are both substituted (position 2 has methyl, position 6 is H), then the base can abstract position 6's H. Elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but then the structure would have a triple bond between 1 and 6. But then, looking at the substituents, the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, which are adjacent to the triple bond?

Wait, but the triple bond would create a lot of strain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is more of a base, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires activating groups and a good leaving group, and under high temperatures or other conditions. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are activating. Wait, but bromide is a leaving group. So maybe the amide ion (NH2-) acts as a nucleophile. But in that case, the product would be a substitution where the bromide is replaced by NH2. But wait, that would be a meta-directing group substitution.

Wait, but let's think: if NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution, especially in a strongly activated ring (with activating groups), nucleophilic substitution could happen. But 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene would have two methyl groups, which are activating. So, perhaps the NH2- would attack the ring in a position activated towards substitution.

Wait, but the bromide is at position 1. So the substituents are methyl at 2 and 4. So the ring has a bromine at 1, methyl at 2 and 4. If substitution occurs, the NH2 would replace Br. But wait, that's possible. So the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

Wait, but I thought elimination is more likely because NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the major pathway is elimination, leading to the formation of a triple bond in the ring.

But then, the structure after elimination would have a triple bond between carbon 1 and 6, but I'm not sure about the feasibility. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a methyl group, which may not be compatible.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's more accessible, leading to the formation of a different elimination product. For example, maybe the hydrogen is abstracted from position 4 instead of 6. But wait, position 4 is a methyl group, so there's no H there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two different positions where elimination can occur, leading to different products. Wait, but in this structure, with the substituents as described, I'm not sure if multiple elimination pathways are possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed with elimination but instead undergoes a coupling reaction. But I'm not recalling any such reaction under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about deprotonation, but I'm not sure what that would lead to.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and upon treatment with NaNH2, it forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2. But since position 2 has a methyl group, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination is less straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the benzene ring, but I don't think that's common without a strong activating group. But methyl groups are activating, so maybe.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. So the product would be a 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-didehydrobenzene, but that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkyne. For example, if the bromide and a hydrogen are eliminated, forming a triple bond adjacent to the methyl groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzene with a substituent that's a triple bond, and the methyl groups are in such a way that they can be in different positions, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. If there's only one way for the elimination to occur, then there's only one product. But if there are multiple possible elimination paths, then more products.

But in the structure 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the only possible beta hydrogen is at position 6. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But then, the substituents are methyl at 2 and 4. So the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, making the structure a bit strained, but perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination can happen in two different ways, leading to different products. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are symmetric around position 1. Let me visualize the molecule: the Br is at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So positions 2 and 4 are symmetric with respect to position 1. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is para to position 2, so perhaps that would lead to a structure where the triple bond is between 1 and 6, with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

But wait, would that be the only possible product? Or, could the triple bond form in a different position, leading to a different product?

Alternatively, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 5, but that's not adjacent to the Br. So that's not a beta hydrogen. So elimination can't happen from there.

Wait, perhaps there's another possible site for elimination. For instance, if the Br is at 1, and a methyl at 2 and 4, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 4. But position 3 is not adjacent to the Br, so that would not lead to elimination of Br.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead the base deprotonates the methyl groups. But methyl groups are pretty stable and don't lose protons easily under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps another possibility is that the bromide leaves, and the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could then capture a proton from somewhere else. But I'm not sure if that's a feasible pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so. Sodium amide is more about deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, maybe the correct reaction is elimination, forming benzyne, but in this case, the structure would have triple bond between 1 and 2. But position 2 has a methyl group, which can't be attached to a sp-hybridized carbon. So that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps this isn't the pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination isn't possible, and the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the options include B) 1 as a possible answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by the amide ion. So the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But wait, substitution would require that the ring is activated towards nucleophilic attack. Methyl groups are activating, so the ring is activated, making substitution feasible. But NaNH2 is a strong base; would it favor the elimination over substitution?

Hmm. In some cases, elimination is favored when possible, especially under high base conditions. So perhaps the major product is the elimination product (the triple bond), and any substitution would be minor.

But if substitution is possible, it would give a different product. So, if both substitution and elimination are possible, how many products would form?

Alternatively, perhaps only elimination is possible, leading to one product.

Wait, but let's think about the product structures. If the elimination forms a triple bond between 1 and 6, that would create a ring with a triple bond. But then, the ring would have methyl groups at 2 and 4, which are in positions that are meta to the triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond between 1 and 6, which is adjacent to the methyl at 2. But I'm not sure about the stability of that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't possible, and the reaction simply doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely as the starting material is a bromide.

Wait, another angle: the structure 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene is actually 2,4-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene. So the substituents are in positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3).

In such a structure, the possible sites for elimination (beta hydrogens) are positions 2 and 6 adjacent to the bromine. But position 2 has a methyl, so the only possible H is at position 6. So elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. So the product would be 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

But wait, in that structure, the triple bond is between 1 and 6, which are adjacent to the methyl at 2. So the methyl is at position 2, which is next to position 1 (triple bond), and position 6 is adjacent to position 1 as well. But position 6 is where the triple bond starts, so the structure would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

But how many possible products can form from this elimination? If the elimination can only happen in one way, then only one product is formed. But if there are multiple possible sites for elimination, more products would form.

Wait, but in this case, the only possible site is position 6, so elimination would only form one product. So the number of products would be 1.

But wait, perhaps the triple bond could form in another position, leading to a different structure. Let me think: suppose the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to elimination elsewhere. But that's not possible because the bromide is only at position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from another position, but that would require the leaving group (Br) to be in a position that allows elimination. So, in this case, only position 6's hydrogen is available for elimination, leading to a single product.

So, the reaction would yield only one product, which is the elimination product with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a substitution, but as I thought earlier, substitution would give another product. So if both elimination and substitution occur, then two products would form.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the mechanism again. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. For a bromobenzene derivative, the reaction typically leads to elimination to form a triple bond (benzyne) if possible. However, in this case, the substituents may block certain elimination paths.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Upon treatment with NaNH2, the base abstracts a beta hydrogen (position 6), leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6. But with methyl groups at 2 and 4, this might not be possible, leading to no reaction. But that doesn't make sense because the question provides options.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, but that's not adjacent to the bromine. So that's not a beta hydrogen.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 4 (which has a methyl), but that's not adjacent to the bromine, so elimination wouldn't occur.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let's think of the possible products. If elimination is possible, we get one product. If substitution is possible, another product. So if both happen, you get two products. But under strong base conditions, elimination is more favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible due to steric hindrance from the methyl groups, leading to substitution as the major pathway, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the possibility of elimination is limited because the only available beta hydrogen is at position 6. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but with the methyl groups at 2 and 4, perhaps that's not possible because of steric issues. Therefore, perhaps elimination isn't feasible, and substitution occurs, leading to the formation of 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

But then, how many products would form in substitution? Only one product, since substitution occurs at the bromine's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple substitution products. But since the ring already has substituents, substitution at bromine's position would only give one product.

So, if substitution is the major pathway, the number of products would be one. If elimination is possible, perhaps another product. So, the total could be two products.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible organic products are formed, not the major product. So, if substitution and elimination are both possible, then two products would form.

But earlier, I thought elimination might not be possible because of the substituents. So perhaps only substitution occurs, giving one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product. For example, if the elimination occurs in different positions, but that's unlikely in this structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen not adjacent to the bromine, but that would require a different mechanism. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a di-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to different sites of elimination.

Wait, but in this structure, if elimination is possible, it can only occur in one way. Thus, only one product would form.

Hmm. So, perhaps the reaction leads to one product via elimination, and no substitution because elimination is favored. Therefore, the number of products is one.

So, looking at the options, option B is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the possibility of elimination. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination, leading to no product, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination or substitution but something else. For example, perhaps coupling via a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think NaNH2 facilitates that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that leads to one product.

In conclusion, I think the reaction forms only one product, so the answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. Sodium amide (NaNH₂) is a strong base, and under these conditions, the reaction typically proceeds via elimination rather than substitution. 

In the starting material, the bromine atom is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. For elimination to occur, a β-hydrogen must be available adjacent to the bromine. The only β-hydrogen available is at position 6, as position 2 is occupied by a methyl group. The base (NH₂⁻) abstracts this β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Given the structure of the starting material, there is only one possible pathway for elimination, as the β-hydrogen at position 6 is the only viable candidate. Substitution (replacement of the bromine with an amine group) is less likely under these strong basic conditions, as elimination is favored. Additionally, the steric hindrance from the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 does not allow for alternative elimination pathways.

Thus, the reaction produces only one product.

Answer: B
