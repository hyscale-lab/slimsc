Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is Sz. So Sz|up> = (ħ/2)|up>, and Sz|down> = -(ħ/2)|down>. 

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix because the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are two in number. 

So for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, maybe (assuming |up> is row 1 and |down> row 2). So when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because if i and j are different, Aij is ħ/2. So when i=1, j=2, and i=2, j=1, those are ħ/2. The diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, Aij is 0. So this operator is like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2)σx.

The eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σx multiplied by a scalar. The eigenstates of σx are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator Sx. Oh wait, but I'm not sure if the operator in question is Sx or something else. Wait, Sx has a matrix like [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2,0]], right? So yes, because Sx = (ħ/2)σx. So the operator A in this problem is Sx itself, because A has elements (ħ/2) at the off-diagonal. Let me confirm: if i≠j, Aij = ħ/2. So yes, that's exactly the matrix for Sx. So the operator in question is Sx.

So the eigenstates of Sx are the eigenstates of the operator A. So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates. The eigenstates of Sx are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator's matrix is A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else 0. So the operator is the same as Sx, right? Because Sx is defined as (ħ/2)(σx), so the matrix for Sx is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That matches exactly with A. So the eigenstates we're considering are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of Sx.

So the first step is to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state. Because the problem says it's proportional, but we need to find the exact probabilities, so normalization is necessary.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down> 

where c1 = (1 + i), c2 = (2 - i). 

The normalization condition is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1. So let's compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

|c1|^2 = (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². i squared is -1, so this becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2.

Similarly, |c2|^2 is (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) =5. Because (2)(2)=4, (2)(i)=2i, (-i)(2)=-2i, (-i)(i)=-i²=1. So 4 + (2i -2i) +1 =5.

So |c1|^2 is 2, |c2|^2 is5. The sum is 7. So the state is proportional to 1/sqrt(7) times the given state. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, because the sum of squares is 2 +5=7, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring |alpha> in the eigenstates of Sx, which are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written in terms of |up> and |down>.

I recall that:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

|-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> )

Wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Wait, the eigenstates of Sx have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, right?

The Sx operator is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ), so its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the superpositions of |up> and |down>. Let me double-check the exact expressions.

The eigenstates can be found by solving (Sx - λ I)|v> = 0.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that the eigenstates are:

|+x> = ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)

and 

|-x> = ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

But wait, wait. Let me confirm. The eigenvalues of Sx are ± ħ/2. So the eigenstates would satisfy Sx |+x> = (ħ/2)|+x>.

Let me compute Sx |+x> = (ħ/2)( |down> + |up> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (ħ/2) ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ) = (ħ/2) |+x> . Yes, that works. So |+x> is correct. Similarly for |-x>.

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis, and we need to find the expansion in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner products between |alpha> and |+x>, and |alpha> and |-x>, square them to get probabilities.

So let's compute the amplitudes.

First, let me express |alpha> in normalized form:

|alpha> = [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis, it's ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Now, the eigenstate |+x> is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) in the same basis.

Similarly, |-x> is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) , (1/sqrt(2)) ] multiplied by [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So let's compute that:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, looking at the options.

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is:

< -x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + [ (-1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i )= (-1) + 2i.

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The absolute square is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4 )/14 =5/14 ≈0.357143, which is approximately 0.36.

But wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, so that's about 0.36.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the inner products more precisely.

Rewriting the inner product for |+x>:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the inner product with |+x> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, because when you take the inner product, it's [ < up | + < down | ] multiplied by |alpha>.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Which is [3] / sqrt(14), as I had before. So the magnitude squared is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

Similarly, for |-x>:

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) / sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i) / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

Which is [ (1 + i - 2 + i) ] / sqrt(14) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

So the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357143.

But wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities are about 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36). So looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and then the average value is hbar/7.

So the first part is matching option A, but let me check the average value part as well.

The average value of the operator A (which is Sx) is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is Sx, which has matrix representation [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and |alpha> is the given state.

To compute <A>, I can express |alpha> as a column vector and compute the expectation value.

Let me write |alpha> as (a, b)^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

The expectation value <A> is [a* b + b* a ] * (ħ/2).

Wait, because the matrix A has elements 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

So compute <A> = (1/sqrt(7))^2 [ a* b + b* a ] * (ħ/2)

Wait, because when you have a vector (a, b)^T, the expectation value is a* b^ + b* a^ multiplied by the matrix elements. So for A, which is [[0, h/2],[h/2,0]], the expectation is a* (h/2) b + b* (h/2) a.

Which is (h/2)( a* b + b* a )

So let me compute a and b:

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So a* is (1 - i)/sqrt(7)
b* is (2 + i)/sqrt(7)

Now compute a* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= (2 -1) ) + (-3i)
= 1 -3i

Similarly, compute b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

Multiply numerator: 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 +2i +i +i^2
=2 +3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
=1 +3i

So a* b + b* a = [1 -3i +1 +3i ] /7
= (2) /7

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Wait, but option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which match my calculations. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the inner products.

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = 3/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is 9/14, which is approximately 0.642857.

Similarly, for |-x>, the inner product was (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are about 0.64 and 0.36.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron in a state |α> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, Sz. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The given state is |α> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- |1+i|² = (1+i)(1-i) = 2,
- |2-i|² = (2-i)(2+i) = 5.

The normalization factor is 1/√7, so the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is the spin-x operator, Sx, whose eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring |+x> and |-x>
The probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3).
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring |-x> is:
\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of A and the coefficients of |α>, compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) \right] \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
(1-i)(2+i) = 1 + 3i, \quad (2+i)(1-i) = 1 - 3i.
\]
Adding these gives:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{7} (2) \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring |+x> and |-x> are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of A is ħ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
