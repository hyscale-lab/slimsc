Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, so maybe it's describing a surface in some space. Since it's a metric in terms of x and y, I'm guessing it's a 2D surface embedded somewhere, maybe in 3D or higher. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So maybe this metric is representing such a surface.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. I remember that the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) depends on its curvature. The formula for the area of a pseudosphere is something like 4πr², but wait, no, wait a second. Wait, pseudosphere has infinite area, doesn't it? Because it's like a horn that keeps going infinitely, right? But wait, maybe I'm getting confused with something else.

Wait, another thought: in 3D, a pseudosphere is a surface with finite volume but infinite surface area. Or was it the other way around? Hmm, no, maybe it's the other way. The volume of a pseudosphere is finite, but the area is infinite. Wait, no, the standard pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is a finite surface with infinite area. Because if you imagine the tractrix curve being revolved, as the parameter goes to infinity, the surface area doesn't converge. So the area would be infinite.

But wait, maybe in this case, the metric is given, so perhaps I should compute the area from the metric. Because the metric might represent a finite area? Or maybe it's a different kind of space.

Wait, let's analyze the metric. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That suggests that the domain of x and y is such that 4 - x² - y² >0, so x² + y² <4. So the coordinates x and y are defined on a disk of radius 2. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which would make the metric blow up. So the metric is only defined for x² + y² <4.

Wait, so the metric is conformally flat, since it's (something) times (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²) where r² is x² + y². So as r approaches 2 (from below), the factor goes to infinity. So this would look like a point at r=2 is at infinite distance away. So the space is a two-dimensional surface that's kind of like a hyperbolic plane, but compact? Hmm.

Wait, I think that this metric is actually representing a two-dimensional space with negative curvature, but the area might be finite because the domain is limited. Wait, but wait, in two dimensions, when you have a metric like this, the area can be computed using the standard area formula for 2D Riemannian manifolds, which is the double integral over the domain of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But in this case, the metric is conformally flat, so the determinant is just [32/(4 - r²)]² times (dx dy). Wait, because the metric tensor has components (g_xx, g_xy, g_yy) where g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 -x² - y²), and g_xy=0. So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², since it's diagonal.

So the area would be the integral over the domain (x² + y² <4) of sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, but in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. So sqrt(g) here is 32/(4 - r²), since sqrt([32/(4-r²)]²) is 32/(4 - r²).

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - (x² + y²))) dx dy.

Hmm, let me switch to polar coordinates, because x² + y² = r². The integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, and theta=0 to 2π, of (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

So the area A is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, let's separate the integrals. The θ integral is 2π. The r integral is from 0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute the r integral. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So substituting:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 -r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(u) = 32 * ∫ (-du/2)/u = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits when r=0, u=4, and r=2, u=0. So ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral becomes ∫ from 4 to 0 of (-16)(1/u) du → which is same as ∫ from 0 to4 (16)(1/u) du. Because the limits are flipped and the negative cancels.

Wait, let me do substitution again:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to2.

Let me do substitution:

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So integral is 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-du/2) ) → 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4→0) (1/u) du.

This becomes 32*(-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0. Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral would diverge. Because [ ln 0 - ln4 ] is -infty - ln4, which is -infty.

So the integral ∫ (32 r dr)/(4-r²) from 0 to2 is (-16) [ ln u ] from 4 to0 → (-16) [ (ln0 - ln4) ] → (-16)(-infty - ln4) → which is positive infinity.

Wait a minute, that means the area integral is 2π multiplied by positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

But wait, that can't be right because the metric's denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the curvature is increasing towards r=2, but the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. A pseudosphere typically has finite area, but maybe in this case, the metric represents an infinite area.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe this metric is actually representing a sphere of radius 2 in some way.

Hmm, the metric is written as ds² = 32/(4 - (x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²). So when r² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which suggests that the "north pole" is at r=2, but the area around it is highly curved.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic geometry, but embedded in a certain way.

Wait, but regardless, the calculation of the area from the metric seems to suggest that the area is infinite, because the integral diverges as r approaches 2. Because the factor is (32/(4 - r²)) which blows up at r=2, and the integral over r from 0 to2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent.

So according to the calculation, the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the correct answer would be D.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The domain of \(x\) and \(y\) is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), as the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) must remain positive to avoid singularities. The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). As \(r \to 2\), the conformal factor diverges, indicating strong curvature near the boundary.

To compute the area of the surface, we use the standard formula for the area element in a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold:

\[
A = \iint \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is \(\left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\), and the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

in polar coordinates (\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(y/x)\)). The area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, separate the angular and radial integrals. The angular integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du\) approaches infinity as \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the area integral diverges, and the total area of the surface is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not relevant to the area calculation.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
