Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu must be a neutrino, right? So the pion is at rest, I think. Because the problem says Pi(+) is stationary. 

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, there are some conservation laws to consider. Oh right! Conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero.

Wait, but neutrinos have very small mass, almost like they're massless. So maybe I can treat them as massless particles for this problem. That might simplify things.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. So the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to these, I think. So it's like m_nu ≈ 0.

The question is about kinetic energy, so I need to find the KE of each product. The pion's rest mass is its total energy since it's at rest. When it decays, the total energy must be conserved between the rest mass and the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is the rest mass of the pion, E_initial = m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy of the muon, the rest energy of the neutrino (which is negligible, since m_nu is almost zero), and their kinetic energies.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu. But E_nu is just its kinetic energy since m_nu c² is negligible.

E_initial = m_pi c² = E_mu + KE_mu + KE_nu.

Wait, actually, E_mu = m_mu c² + KE_mu, and E_nu = KE_nu (since m_nu c² ≈ 0). So the total energy is m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu.

So, KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c².

But I don't know KE_mu or KE_nu individually yet. Oh wait, but since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu, so their magnitudes are the same.

Hmm, I think I can use conservation of momentum. The vector sum of the momenta must be zero. So p_mu = -p_nu, so |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But for each particle, the energy is related to their momentum and mass.

For the muon: E_mu² = (p c)² c² + (m_mu c²)². So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 c² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Energy is E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ).

For the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0, E_nu = p c. Because E² = (p c)^2 + (0)^2 → E = p c.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

And this must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, 139.6 = sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, that's one equation with one unknown (p c). Let me denote x = p c. So the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for x.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7²).

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x² = x² + (105.7)^2.

Cancel out x² on both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x = (105.7)^2.

Compute the squares numerically.

139.6^2: Let me calculate that. 139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So plugging into the equation:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 x.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 x → 8315.67 = 279.2 x.

Solve for x:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute this.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's see: 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So 279.2 *29.8 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is more than 8315.67 by 60.33.

So 30 is too high, let's try 29.8:

279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30-0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2) = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

But 8320.16 is still more than 8315.67 by about 4.49.

Hmm, so 29.8 gives 8320.16. So perhaps x is approximately 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, maybe I can just do 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.77.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.77 = ?

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 *0.77 = 279.2 *0.7 = 195.44, 279.2 *0.07=19.544 → total 195.44+19.544=214.984.

So 8096.8 +214.984 =8311.784. Hmm, but we have 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8311.784 =3.886.

So 279.2 per unit x, so 3.886/279.2 ≈ 0.0139.

So x≈29.77 +0.0139 ≈29.7839.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I can use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just go with 29.78 or so.

So x ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, x is p c, so p = x / c.

But for the purposes of finding KE, perhaps I don't need to find p, but I can proceed.

So, we have x ≈29.78 MeV.

Now, E_nu = x =29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute 29.78^2: approx 29.78*29.78. Let's see:

30^2=900, so 29.78^2 ≈ (30-0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22²= 900 -13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

But wait, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 -105.7 ≈4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's KE is x=29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check what the options say.

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Option C) 3.52, 20.8 → seems lower than my calculation.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation for x.

Wait, I think I messed up something earlier.

Wait, let me redo the equation step by step.

We had 139.6 = sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

Let me rearrange: sqrt(x^2 +105.7^2) = 139.6 -x.

Square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So:

x^2 +11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x +x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

11172.49 =19488.16 -279.2x.

Then, 279.2x = 19488.16 -11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49:

19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 → Let me compute this.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 * 29.7 → 279.2 *29 =8096.8; 279.2 *0.7=195.44 → total 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24.

279.2 *29.8 → 8292.24 + 279.2 *0.1=27.92 → 8292.24 +27.92=8320.16.

But 8320.16 is higher than 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.49 over.

So, the exact x is between 29.7 and 29.8.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.77 → 29.77 =29 + 0.77.

279.2 *29=8096.8.

0.77 *279.2 → 0.7*279.2=195.44; 0.07*279.2=19.544 → total 214.984.

So 29.77 *279.2=8096.8 +214.984=8311.784.

So 8311.784 is less than 8315.67 by 3.886.

So, 3.886 /279.2 ≈ 0.0139.

So x ≈29.77 +0.0139=29.7839, approximately 29.784.

So x≈29.784 MeV.

So E_nu =29.784 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 +105.7^2 ).

Compute (29.784)^2 → approx 29.784 *29.784. Let me compute:

(30 -0.216)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 =900 -12.96 +0.046656=887.086656.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.576656) ≈109.812 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu =109.812 -105.7 =4.112 MeV.

Neutrino's KE is x=29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says mu KE is 4.12 MeV, neutrino's 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is treated as massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy of the muon, the rest energy of the neutrino (negligible), and their kinetic energies:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]

For the muon:
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{(p_\mu c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2},
\]
where \(p_\mu\) is the momentum of the muon.

For the neutrino:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu c,
\]
since \(m_\nu \approx 0\).

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero:
\[
p_\mu = -p_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad |p_\mu| = |p_\nu| = p.
\]

Let \(x = p c\). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x.
\]

### Solving for \(x\)
Rearranging:
\[
139.6 - x = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 105.7^2.
\]

Substituting numerical values:
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 11172.49.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
8315.67 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(E_\nu = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{887.086656 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.576656} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Results
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). These values match closely with **Option D**.
