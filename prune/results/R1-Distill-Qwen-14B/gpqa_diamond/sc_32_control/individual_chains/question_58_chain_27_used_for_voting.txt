Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. Hmm.

First, I need to remember what regularization means in physics. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary modification to the theory to make these infinities manageable, and then you remove the regularization, hopefully getting finite results after renormalization.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization at high energies. High energy usually implies that the theory is being pushed to its limits, maybe approaching some scale where it breaks down or needs to be modified.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a quantum theory of gravity and attempts to unify all forces. It's a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because it deals with strings rather than point particles, maybe it avoids these infinities. Or perhaps it requires some form of regularization, but maybe it's not needed in the same way. I'm not entirely sure, but I think string theories might not require the same type of divergent regularization because their perturbative expansions are different. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills, but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD is known to have a property called asymptotic freedom, where at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative methods applicable. Wait, but when you do calculations in QCD, especially in perturbation theory, you sometimes get divergences. So you would need regularization. For instance, in loop calculations, you have to regularize the integrals to make sense of them before renormalizing. So QCD does require regularization. So B is out.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood quantum field theory. It does have divergences, like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization. These require regularization and renormalization to make physical sense. Without regularization, the theory would predict infinities for things like the charge and mass of the electron. So C requires regularization, so not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. In classical E&M, you don't have the same issues with divergences that come from quantum fluctuations. For example, in classical theory, you can have point charges with infinite densities, but the theory itself doesn't have the same loop divergences as in QED. So in classical E&M, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So D might be the correct answer.

So putting this together. The question is about which theory doesn't need regularization at high energies. High energies for QED and QCD would require considering quantum effects, leading to the need for regularization. But in classical E&M, there's no regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So option D is the one that doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but what about Superstring Theory? I thought that string theories, especially when dealing with high energies, might need regularization, but maybe they don't? Or perhaps string theories naturally avoid these issues because of their structure. Alternatively, perhaps string theories require some form of regularization when calculating amplitudes, but I'm not certain. However, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. 

Classical theories don't use regularization because they don't have the same divergent loop integrals as quantum theories. So if the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization, it's probably D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

1. **Superstring Theory (A):** Superstring theory is a quantum theory of gravity that unifies forces and is free from certain types of divergences due to its string-based framework. However, it still involves high-energy calculations and may require regularization in some contexts, though it is less clear than for other quantum field theories. This option is uncertain.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, involves divergences in loop calculations that require regularization. Even though it has asymptotic freedom at high energies, perturbative methods still necessitate regularization to handle infinities. Thus, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (C):** QED, the theory of electromagnetism, is a well-established quantum field theory. It suffers from divergences in calculations, such as electron self-energy and vacuum polarization, which require regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED also requires regularization.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (D):** Classical E&M is a non-quantum theory and does not involve the divergences associated with quantum field theories. It does not require regularization because it lacks the loop integrals and other quantum effects that necessitate such techniques. Hence, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

Based on this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
