Okay, I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. So, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The reactions involve butan-2-one and another compound reacting with reagents A and B respectively.

The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. So, butan-2-one is a ketone, reacting with NaCN. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In acidic conditions, maybe? Because I think the addition of HCN to ketones usually happens under specific conditions.

Wait, in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would be a nitrile group added, and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, that's right. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with HCN, typically under acidic conditions. So, the reagent A must be something that provides the H+ to make it acidic.

Looking at the options, A can be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is just a source of H+ ions, like in an acid. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- and H+ in solution. So, for the first reaction, which requires an acid, either of these might be possible. But wait, what's the role of each reagent.

For the formation of cyanohydrin, the typical conditions are HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, the reaction would be butan-2-one + HCN in acidic conditions. Here, NaCN is providing the CN- ion, but where's the HCN coming from? Oh wait, maybe in the presence of an acid, like H3O+, the CN- from NaCN can pick up H+ to form HCN, which then adds to the ketone.

So, in this case, reagent A is the acid. So, if option A is H3O+, that would make sense. Let me look at the options. Option A says A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option D says A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

Wait, but another thought: NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+? Or maybe it's a source of H+ as well. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is about the formation of the cyanohydrin, which requires an acid. So, if A is H3O+, that would help generate HCN from NaCN. So, the first reaction would use H+ as A, so H3O+ is option A.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes NaHSO3 is used as an acid catalyst. So, if A is NaHSO3, it would provide H+ as well. Let me think about what's more common. For the cyanohydrin formation, it's usually done with HCN and an acid like H2SO4. Alternatively, sometimes NaHSO3 is used because it's a mild acid. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but when you have NaCN, adding an acid would protonate CN^- to make HCN, which can then attack the carbonyl. So, in the first reaction, the reaction is ketone + NaCN + A (acid) -> cyanohydrin.

So, which of the options has A as an acid? Option A and D have A as H3O+ and NaHSO3, respectively. H3O+ is a strong acid (since it's the conjugate acid of water), while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid.

Wait, but in the first reaction, perhaps the cyanide comes from NaCN, and the acid is necessary to protonate the CN^- to form HCN. So, which of these would do that?

H3O+ would definitely provide H+ ions. NaHSO3 would also provide H+ because it dissociates into H+ and HSO3^- in solution. So, either of them could work as an acid. But which one is more likely in such a reaction?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the second part of the problem. The second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. So the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative, and the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid.

So, the reaction is probably the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. But wait, nitriles can hydrolyze under different conditions. Typically, nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid requires either strong acid (like HCl) and heat or other conditions, or maybe using a base with H2O.

Wait, but the product is a hydroxy acid, so perhaps it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid via the amide intermediate. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon. Now, when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol, perhaps under certain conditions, it can undergo oxidation or hydrolysis.

But the second reaction is using H2O as a reagent. So, perhaps the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the hydroxyl group is still present.

So, how does that happen? Nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involves strong acidic conditions, such as HCl and heat, or using a strong base like aqueous H2SO4 with HgSO4 as a catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of water and an acid, the nitrile could hydrolyze. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid using a strong acid. So, reagent B is HCl. Because in the options, B is HCl in option A, and in option C, B is HCl as well.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is written as B (H2O). Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Because in the question, it's written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product. So, perhaps B is the reagent but the reaction is with water, but under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzing in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, maybe B is HCl, which acts as both the acid and the catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which would require either strong acid or strong base conditions. Let me think about the typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using a strong acid, like conc. HCl, with heat, or under basic conditions (like NaOH, H2O, heat). Alternatively, using a mild acid might not be enough.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is under acidic conditions to form the cyanohydrin. The second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. If the first step uses H3O+ (option A), then the second step uses HCl as the reagent. Alternatively, if the first step uses NaHSO3, the second step could be something else.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, for the first reaction, the correct A would be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. For the second, B needs to be a strong acid (like HCl) for the nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if B is HCl, that would fit the second reaction. So, options A and C have B as HCl.

So, the first reaction's A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. What's the difference between the two?

H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid (HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H+). So, in the first reaction, the formation of the cyanohydrin requires acid, but perhaps the strength of the acid matters.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN^- which is a weak base. So, in an acidic solution, CN^- would be protonated to form HCN, which is a better nucleophile? Or is that the case? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of H+ and HSO3^- as a buffer, perhaps. Or maybe it's a milder acid than H3O+.

Wait, but the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the cyanide is adding to the ketone to form the cyanohydrin.

In acidic conditions, the ketone is protonated, making it a better electrophile. Then CN- (from NaCN) attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, the presence of H+ is essential. So, either H3O+ or NaHSO3 would provide H+.

If the reaction uses NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, perhaps it's sufficient. So, both options A and C could be possible for the first reaction.

But for the second reaction, the nitrile needs to be hydrolyzed. Let me think about the typical reagents. Nitrile to carboxylic acid is usually done under strong acidic (like HCl) or strong basic conditions (like NaOH with H2O and heat). So, if B is HCl, that would make sense. So, options A and C have B=HCl.

Now, looking at the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that's a strong acid. If it's NaHSO3, that's a weaker acid. Which is more suitable for the formation of the cyanohydrin?

Wait, I think that NaHSO3 is often used in such reactions because it's a mild acid. For example, in the addition of HCN to ketones, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a buffer because it can provide a moderate acidic environment. H3O+ (from HCl or H2SO4) is a strong acid, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, perhaps better for this purpose.

So, maybe the correct A is NaHSO3, and B is HCl. That would make option C the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The reaction of ketones with HCN to form cyanohydrins is often done in the presence of an acid. For example, HCN is usually added with an acid like H2SO4. So, if we're using NaCN and an acid to generate HCN, then the acid is necessary.

So, if the reagent is H3O+ (like HCl), that would provide the necessary H+ for HCN formation. Alternatively, NaHSO3 provides H+ as well.

But why would one be chosen over the other? Maybe because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and also can act as a buffer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN (from NaCN and H3O+), and the second uses HCl for hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. That would make option A the choice, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN to this would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So, the first reaction is correct when using HCN in an acidic medium.

Now, the second reaction is the nitrile converting to a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) becomes -COOH. How is that done?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids with strong HCl and heat, or with aqueous H2SO4 and HgSO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, under basic conditions with heat.

But in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions must be acidic. So, reagent B is HCl (as in options A and C).

So, if B is HCl, then the second reaction is likely a hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

So, considering that, for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid. So, between options A and C, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Which is more likely for the first reaction? H3O+ or NaHSO3?

I think that when adding HCN to a ketone, usually a strong acid catalyst is used. For example, H2SO4 is a common catalyst. So, H3O+ is a source of H+ ions, similar to H2SO4. So, option A has A as H3O+.

So, if A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that's option A.

Wait, but then why is option C present with A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well. Maybe in some cases, a milder acid is used.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A. So, let's think: for the cyanohydrin formation, sometimes a controlled acid is used, perhaps NaHSO3 is a better choice. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: perhaps the first reaction is done under acidic conditions, but in the presence of more than just H+. Maybe the nitrile is a good enough nucleophile without needing a strong acid. Hmm, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 and the second uses HCl. So, option C would be correct.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look for another angle. Maybe the second reaction's reagent can help me decide.

The second reaction is about hydrolyzing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The starting material has both a hydroxyl and nitrile group. So, perhaps the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile, making it a vicinal diol or something else.

Wait, no. The structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)CH2CN ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me imagine the structure. It's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the butane chain has four carbons. The second carbon (position 2) has a hydroxyl group and a phenyl group attached, perhaps. The last carbon is a nitrile.

So, the structure is:

CH2- C(OH)(Phenyl group) - CH2 - CN

Wait, but that's butanenitrile, so four carbons. So, it's:

CH2- C(OH)(Phenyl group) - CH2 - CN

No, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So, the substituents on the second carbon would be the hydroxyl and the 4-benzylphenyl group.

So, the molecule is:

CH2- C(OH)(Phenyl)-CH2-CN

Now, when this undergoes hydrolysis to become a carboxylic acid, the CN group becomes COOH, and the hydroxyl remains.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

So, the reagent B is HCl. So, in the presence of HCl and water, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

So, the second part requires B = HCl, which is in options A and C.

So, now the question is which A is correct.

The first reaction: NaCN + A (acid) → HCN.

If A is H3O+ (option A), then it's a strong acid; if A is NaHSO3 (option C), it's a weaker acid.

In the formation of cyanohydrins, sometimes a strong acid is used. For example, using HCl as the acid. So, perhaps A is H3O+.

But in the options, A is H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but H3O+ is just the aqueous H+ ions, which is a strong acid. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, since HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H+.

Wait, but wait: NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than HCN (pKa around 1.8 for HCN, but HSO3^- has a pKa around 1.8 as well? Wait, no, HSO3^- has a pKa around 1.8? Wait, no. Let me think: H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) has pKa1 around 1.8 and pKa2 around 7.2. So, HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, so its pKa is ~7.2.

So, HSO3^- is a weaker base than CN^- (which has a pKa of ~9.2 for HCN). So, in an acidic solution, CN^- would be protonated to HCN, which is a better nucleophile.

So, if A is H3O+ (option A), then the solution is strongly acidic, which would protonate CN^- to form HCN, which would then attack the ketone.

If A is NaHSO3 (option C), which provides H+ and HSO3^-, but the H+ would still protonate CN^- to form HCN. So, either A would work, but perhaps H3O+ is a stronger acid and might drive the reaction more effectively.

Therefore, for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second, B is HCl, making option A the correct choice.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A says B=HCl. So, that fits the second reaction.

Alternatively, I'm a bit unsure because I've heard that sometimes NaHSO3 is used in the cyanohydrin formation. Let me think again. In some procedures, like the addition of HCN to ketones, a solution of NaHSO3 is used to generate a controlled amount of HCN and to buffer the solution. So, perhaps A is NaHSO3.

In that case, the reaction would be butan-2-one + NaCN + NaHSO3 → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Then, for the second reaction, B is HCl, so option C would be correct.

Wait, but option C says B=HCl. So, if I go with that logic, option C would be correct.

But I'm getting a bit confused because I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, and the second uses HCl. So, option A.

But I'm a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Another way: what is the role of each reagent in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+ (acid), B=HCl (acid for hydrolysis)
Option C: A=NaHSO3 (acid), B=HCl

Which of these is correct?

The first reaction requires an acid, so either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The second requires HCl.

So, the answer would be either A or C.

But which A is correct.

Wait, another thought. The first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. The nitrile is a good nucleophile, but in the presence of a strong acid, maybe it's better.

Wait, but nitrile is a weak base, so in an acidic solution, it's protonated. Wait, no, CN^- is a stronger base than H2O, so in an acid, CN^- picks up H+ to form HCN.

So, in either case, whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3, HCN is formed, which then adds to the ketone.

But perhaps the choice of A depends on the specific conditions. For example, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^- which can act as a buffer, preventing the solution from becoming too acidic. Maybe that's better for the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps H3O+ is more likely because it's a stronger acid, which would better drive the reaction to form the cyanohydrin.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for some textbook examples.

In the formation of cyanohydrins, the reaction is typically:

R2CO + HCN → R2C(OH)CN

This is done under acidic conditions. The acid is necessary to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.

In the reaction, HCN is added to the ketone. HCN is often added with an acid catalyst. So, if we have NaCN as the source of CN^-, then in the presence of an acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4), it would form HCN.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, that's correct.

Then, the second reaction needs a strong acid for hydrolysis. So, B is HCl.

Thus, the correct option would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options again.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer must be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, while the second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Reaction 1: Formation of Cyanohydrin
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. For this reaction, the acid is necessary to protonate the CN⁻ ion, forming HCN, which then nucleophilically attacks the ketone. Both H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) and NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) can provide the required H⁺ ions. However, H₃O⁺ is a stronger acid and is more commonly used in such reactions to drive the formation of the cyanohydrin effectively.

### Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of water. This typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a strong acid, suitable for the first reaction. HCl is a strong acid, suitable for the second reaction. This combination is correct.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid, insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. This combination is incorrect.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid, which may not be as effective as H₃O⁺ for the first reaction. However, HCl is suitable for the second reaction. While plausible, H₃O⁺ is more commonly used for the first reaction.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - CH₃COOH is too weak for the second reaction. This combination is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The most suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as they effectively facilitate both the cyanohydrin formation and the nitrile hydrolysis reactions.

Answer: A
