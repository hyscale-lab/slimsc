Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. So, the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, no, wait. It says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/(1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5. Because (1/(1/r^5)) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Hmm, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (like how many stars exist between r and r + dr) would be the derivative dN/dr. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance goes as r^4.

But wait, let me double-check. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So the total number up to radius r is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars between r and r+dr would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4 dr. So the density of stars (number per unit distance) is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars in a given distance interval increases as r^4, which is option C.

But wait, wait. Am I sure about the setup? The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (plx)^-5, where k is some constant. And since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

Now, the question is about the change in number per unit distance. So it's the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr, which is dN = (dN/dr) dr. So dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number per unit distance (dN) is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

A) r^3

B) r^5

C) r^4

D) r^2

So the correct answer would be C. Is that right? Let me recount. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume, but here the relation is given in terms of parallax. So for each unit of distance, the number of stars increases as r^4.

Alternatively, if the number of stars in a region is proportional to r^5, then the number in a thin shell would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So yes, the number per unit distance is r^4. So the answer is C.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars up to a distance \( r \) increases as \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range (\( \frac{dN}{dr} \)), we take the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the scaling is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the number per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the scaling is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).
