Okay, let's try to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, so the first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like dibromides) react with KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so maybe the reaction happens where the bromines are in positions that allow for that.

So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent (or vicinal) carbons? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromo would be on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is more like a diamondoid structure, maybe with multiple rings. So 1 and 3 are probably on different parts. Wait, but when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, like in 1,2-dibromo, then elimination would give an alkene. But in this case, 1,3-dibromo might not be adjacent, so maybe the KOH does something else. Or maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess and heated, perhaps it's a double SN2 substitution. But considering adamantane's structure is very rigid, SN2 is unlikely because of the steric hindrance. So maybe it's more of an E2 elimination if the structure allows for it. Wait, but with two bromines, perhaps the product would be a diol if it's a substitution, but with two OH groups.

Wait, the product after heating with KOH is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the product isn't a diol but a diketone or something else with a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. How can KOH cause the formation of a carbonyl?

Wait, wait. Maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone? Oh, no, elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a substitution or elimination but something else.

Wait a minute, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for amines. Wait, or maybe a Fittig reaction? That's when two aryl halides are coupled, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Let's think: if each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require a substitution, and two OH groups. But then, under certain conditions, could those OH groups lose protons and form ketones? Maybe if the structure is strained, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't seem straightforward. Maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, but the initial structure was 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which probably isn't adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 is probably a triplet or another splitting, but 2H. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which could be from CH2 groups adjacent to something. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group near an electronegative atom or in a different environment.

Wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a diketone. So maybe the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Let me think about possible mechanisms. Maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then the O- groups lose H+ to form ketones. But under what conditions? Maybe via elimination of HBr. Wait, but KOH is a strong base. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- which then gets deprotonated, but that would require acidic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br leaves, and the resulting carbanions combine with each other. Wait, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are eliminated as Br-, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but then how does a carbonyl form?

Hmm, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, another approach. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The 1H NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which is around where an alcohol or maybe an ether would be, but more likely something like an OCH2 group. 4.79 ppm is also where a ketone's alpha protons might be. For example, in acetone, the CH3 is around 2.1, but maybe in a more substituted environment, the protons could be downfield.

Wait, in the NMR, 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. Then, the 2H at 1.94 could be another CH2 group. The 10H in the 2.4-2.23 region are likely from CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a ring.

If product 1 is a diketone, perhaps like 1,3-diketone adamantane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-ketone and another group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a Dieckmann cyclization, but that would require ester groups, which we don't have. Alternatively, maybe it's a Robinson annulation, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. But how? For each Br, perhaps each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbon is oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent unless it's under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but forming a double bond, but how does that lead to a carbonyl? Oh, wait, maybe after elimination, further oxidation occurs, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless the reaction is in a particular setup, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a glycol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a ketone and an ether. No, but the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. Let's think: if both Br are replaced by O groups, but they are in positions that allow for the formation of a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH to form a 1,3-diketone.

How would that happen? Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, which then loses H2O to form the carbonyl. But that would require two elimination steps. So each Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is involved in a substitution to form an alcohol, and then those alcohols lose protons to form ketones. But I thought that substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but in adamantane's structure, it's hard to have SN2.

Wait, perhaps it's an E2 elimination for each Br, forming two double bonds, but that would give a diene. But that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, which upon protonation gives an ether. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage. If the adamantane structure is such that two Br are on adjacent carbons, then eliminating both would form a carbonyl group. For example, if a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo) is treated with a base, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. Because each elimination would form a double bond, but with two eliminations, perhaps the adjacent carbons lose H and Br, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for the Br's to be in positions that, upon elimination, form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide, but that's usually from a dihalide with a base, but the IR doesn't suggest that.

Wait, another thought: if the product has a carbonyl, the 4.79 ppm peak could be adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to a ketone. For example, in acetone, the CH3 is around 2.1, but if it's a CH2, maybe around 2.2-2.4, which matches the 2.41-2.23 region. So perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but the 4.79 is 2H. So maybe it's an OCH2 group. Let me think: if the product is a ketone and an ether, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would require two OH groups on the same carbon, which would show up as a broad peak, which isn't indicated here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 may have a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to some kind of enol formation or perhaps a Friedel-Crafts reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and product 2 is formed by heating with excess Al isopropoxide. Friedel-Crafts typically requires aromatic rings, but if product 1 has a carbonyl group in a position that can form an enol, perhaps it's forming an enol ether or something.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Al isopropoxide is causing some kind of dehydration to form a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit because the product 1 already has a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the second step forms a ketone via some elimination. So product 2 would have more carbonyl groups or a different arrangement.

Wait, but let me focus on the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

But in the question, product 3's 1H NMR is being asked about, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So the most deshielded would be near an electronegative atom, like oxygen, or in a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bond was.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Let me think backwards. Product 1 is reacted with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone.

Wait, another approach: product 1 is a diene or has a double bond. Because, if product 2 is formed by a reaction that introduces a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it. Hmm, but product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, which I thought might form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide might lead to elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

So let's try to piece this together.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH → product 1.

If KOH causes elimination, perhaps each Br leaves with a base, leading to the formation of a diol. Wait, but if two eliminations occur, perhaps forming an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but more likely elimination.

Wait, maybe the product is an alkene. Let me think, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form a diene. But wait, 1,3-dibromo might not be adjacent, so elimination would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure allows for a different elimination pathway.

Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the NMR of product 1 again.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows:

- 4.79 (2H) → perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe O.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H) → probably several CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a ring.
- 1.94 (2H) → another CH2 group.

So, it's possible that product 1 is a secondary or tertiary alcohol. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. So, after treatment with KOH, two ketone groups are formed. Then, when product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enol formation or Friedel-Crafts acylation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, it causes the diol to lose water and form a carbonyl group, making a ketone. But then, product 2 would have a carbonyl, and product 3 would be formed via ozonolysis, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, another thought. Suppose product 1 is an epoxide. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide might ring-open the epoxide. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 1250 cm^-1, which is typical for epoxides. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide could form an enol, which might lead to some rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol with two adjacent OH groups. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, a strong acid catalyst, it could dehydrate to form a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would be the result of ozone cleavage. Let's imagine that the alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

But wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl group, perhaps as a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

So, if the carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, the protons on the adjacent CH2 would have coupling with both the carbonyl-adjacent CH2 and any others.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If product 2 is an alkene, say, between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For each fragment, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In product 3, each of these carbonyls would have adjacent CH2 groups. The most deshielded would be the one on the end, perhaps a CH2 group attached directly to the carbonyl.

So, the structure of product 3 would have something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R', but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let's try to model this. Suppose product 2 is an alkene in such a way that ozonolysis would create two ketone groups. For example, if product 2 is a cyclohexene ring, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups connected by something else.

But wait, the initial compound is adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure. So after elimination, product 2 would have a double bond within the adamantane structure.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a mono-alkene adamantane. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring protons. If it's a CH2 group next to another CH2, each proton would have coupling with two sets of neighboring protons.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. Each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the adjacent CH2's protons. Suppose the structure is something like (CO)-(CH2)2-something. So, the CH2 next to CO would have two neighboring protons from the same group and possibly others.

Wait, maybe it's like this: the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl is itself connected to another CH2. So, each proton on the first CH2 would have coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each. But wait, each proton on the first CH2 would also be split by their neighboring protons on the same CH2, which would be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is only coupled to the next CH2, which has two protons. So each proton would have a triplet (coupled with two protons from the adjacent CH2). But wait, the adjacent CH2 would have protons that are also coupled to each other, so the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, if the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a -CH2-CO- group. The protons on this CH2 would couple with the next CH2 group, which has two protons. So each proton on the first CH2 would have a triplet from coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. But the adjacent CH2's protons would also couple with each other, but that's a separate consideration.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's imagine that each of these CH2 groups is next to a carbonyl. So the first CH2 (adjacent to CO) has two protons. Each of these protons would couple with the two protons on the next CH2. So each would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the adjacent CH2's protons are also coupled to the next group, but perhaps that's more than we need to consider for the most deshielded proton.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 next to the carbonyl is itself part of a longer chain, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-..., then the end CH2 would have neighboring protons only from the CH2 before it. But that's not necessarily the case here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. So each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

But wait, considering that the first CH2 is next to the carbonyl, and the second CH2 is next to that, perhaps the first CH2's protons each have two neighboring protons (from the second CH2), leading to a triplet. But because the first CH2's protons are also coupled to each other, perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

Wait, but in a CH2 group, the two protons are equivalent, so the coupling between them is usually not observed as splitting in the NMR because they are equivalent and split each other into a singlet. Wait, no—equivalent protons don't split each other because their coupling doesn't cause splitting. So each proton in the CH2 group would only see the neighboring group's protons as coupling partners.

So, if each CH2 group has two protons, and the first CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, then the first CH2's protons would each see two protons from the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet. But wait, the adjacent CH2's protons are also split by their own coupling. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to each of the most deshielded protons being part of a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. Each of these protons would have two neighboring protons, so their signals would be triplets.

Wait, but the options for the coupling pattern include triplet of triplets, which would imply coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, if a proton is coupled to two different groups of protons, each with a different coupling constant, it would result in a triplet of triplets.

So, in this case, the most deshielded proton (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be coupled to two protons on one adjacent group and possibly another group.

Wait, maybe the structure looks like this: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-... So the first CH2 (adjacent to CO) is coupled to the next CH2's two H, which are themselves coupled to another CH2. But perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group, leading to coupling with different numbers of protons.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try to approach this systematically.

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 has a single double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Assuming product 2 is a mono-alkene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be attached to a CH2 group, perhaps.

So, the structure of product 3 could be something like O=C-(CH2)n-O-C=O, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's two separate carbonyl compounds.

But the NMR of product 3 is what's important. The most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs. If the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each H is also coupled to another set of Hs elsewhere, leading to more splitting. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs from the next CH2, and perhaps also with another group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if the most deshielded H is on a CH2 that is next to another CH2 (with two Hs), then it would have a triplet. But if it's also coupled to another group with a different J, then it could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that is adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs. Then, each H on the CH2 would see two Hs from the CH group, resulting in a triplet. But if the CH group is itself adjacent to another CH2, the Hs on the CH2 might also be coupled to those, adding another layer of splitting.

Wait, but if the structure is such that the CH2 next to the carbonyl is connected to a CH group, which is connected to another CH2, then each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would see two Hs from the CH group, leading to a triplet. Additionally, each H on the CH2 might also see the two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to another triplet, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

So, in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group, which has two Hs, then each of those Hs on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the CH, leading to a triplet. But if the CH group is itself next to another CH2, then each H on the CH might couple with those as well, but that might not directly affect the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is only coupled to the adjacent CH2, which has two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet, which is option A.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the product 3's structure after ozonolysis.

If product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose the alkene was in a straight chain, like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's probably not the case in adamantane.

Wait, considering adamantane's structure, product 2 probably has a double bond within the diamondoid framework. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, each connected to a CH2 group.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. Each CH2 would then have two Hs that are adjacent to the carbonyl.

In the NMR, each of these Hs would be deshielded and would couple with the neighboring CH2's Hs. So, each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would see two Hs from the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if each CH2 is only connected to another CH2, then the splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is connected to a CH group, which has two Hs, then each H on the CH2 would see two Hs from the CH group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is only connected to another CH2, then each H would only see two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: the most deshielded H could be part of a geminal diol, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-X, where X is another group, then the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would have two Hs, each seeing the two Hs on the next CH2. So each would be a triplet.

But if each H on the first CH2 is also coupled to another group, like a neighboring CH2 with two Hs, then the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But the adjacent CH2's Hs would also couple with their own neighbors, but that doesn't directly affect the first CH2's Hs.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet, so option A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: look at the options and think about possible structures. The most deshielded H is likely next to a carbonyl. If that H is on a CH2 that's next to another CH2, then each H would see two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group with two Hs. That would mean each H on the CH2 is coupled to two Hs, leading to a triplet. If there's another coupling, perhaps from another adjacent group, it could result in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that would require the H to be coupled with three different sets of Hs. That's less likely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, option B.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: in ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. The adjacent CH2 groups would have their Hs split based on neighboring groups.

If the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl are also adjacent to another CH2, then they would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the Hs are adjacent to both a carbonyl and a CH group, each H would couple with two Hs from the CH group, leading to a triplet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be sure.

Wait, the initial product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, suggesting a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but product 1 is a ketone, which might undergo some kind of enol formation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Wait, let's reevaluate. Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

If product 1 is a diol, then treating with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) could cause elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups, leading to product 3. So in product 3, each carbonyl group would be adjacent to CH2 groups.

The most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

But I'm not entirely sure because I might have gotten the structure wrong. Alternatively, if the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs, then each H on the CH2 would see two Hs from the CH, leading to a triplet. If the CH group is also adjacent to another CH2, the Hs on the CH2 would also see those, but that's probably beyond the question's scope.

So, tentatively, I think the coupling pattern is a triplet, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The reaction likely involves elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a diol or a diketone. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, suggesting that product 1 is a diketone.

2. **Reaction 2: Treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates further reaction. Given that product 1 is a diketone, the subsequent reaction could involve dehydration or rearrangement to form an alkene (product 2). This is consistent with the formation of a double bond, which would later undergo ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond introduces carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
