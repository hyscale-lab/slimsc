Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction. In Yukawa theory, the coupling between a scalar boson and fermions is something like λ ψ ψ X, right? So the mass term comes from the v, which is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of some scalar field. 

Wait, but the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of X. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent.

So X is a boson, and in the given interaction, it couples to various fermions. So the possible decay channels are into fermion-antifermion pairs. The options given are different combinations of these pairs.

Let me list out all possible fermion pairs X can decay into. The fermions would have to be those that are lighter than 3 GeV each because X is 6 GeV. Because each fermion and antifermion must each be less than 3 GeV to sum to 6 GeV. 

Wait, but wait. For a decay into two particles, each must individually have a mass less than X's mass. Because when X is at rest, the decay products would each have some energy, but their rest masses must add up to less than or equal to X's mass. So each fermion must have a mass less than 6 GeV. Or wait, no, each fermion's mass must be less than X's mass divided by 2. Because if each is m, then 2m ≤ M_X. So m ≤ M_X / 2. 

So M_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the known fermion masses, let's think:

- Up-type quarks: up (u), charm (c), top (t). The masses are about u ~ 2 MeV, c ~ 1.3 GeV, t ~ 173 GeV. So t is way too heavy (173 GeV > 3 GeV). So u and c are possible, but t is not.

- Down-type quarks: down (d), strange (s), bottom (b). d ~ 4-5 MeV, s ~ 95-100 MeV, b ~ 4.5 GeV. So b is about 4.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV? Wait, 4.5 is more than 3. So wait, 4.5 GeV > 3 GeV. So the b quark is 4.5 GeV, so each b would need to be less than 3 GeV for X to decay into b bbar. But 4.5 * 2 is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 4.5 * 2 =9 >6. So that decay is not allowed. Hmm, but wait, in the options, some include b and some don't. So that's a point.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: For X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each must satisfy m_fermion ≤ M_X / 2. So for each fermion, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

u: 2 MeV → yes

d: ~5 MeV → yes

s: ~100 MeV → yes

c: ~1.3 GeV → yes (1.3 <3)

t: 173 GeV → no

b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no

Similarly, charged leptons:

e: ~0.5 MeV → yes

mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes (0.1 <3)

tau: ~1.78 GeV →1.78 <3 → yes

What about neutrinos? Well, the problem doesn't list any neutrino options, so I guess we're only considering charged leptons and quarks.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. 

Wait, but wait: The interaction term has "f", which probably represents all the fermion types. But in the Lagrangian, the interaction is written as -λ_f f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a typo, and it should be ψ_f and ψ_f bar? Because the term should be something like λ ψ ψ X, which would be a scalar interaction. So perhaps the correct term is λ_f ψ_f^† ψ_f (v + X). But that's probably a Yukawa coupling.

But regardless, the point is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. So, which fermions are those?

So the allowed fermions are:

- Quarks: u (up), d (down), s (strange), c (charm). Because their masses are way below 3 GeV.

- Leptons: e (electron), mu (muon), tau (tau lepton). Tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV.

But wait, the bottom quark (b) is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because each b is 4.5 GeV, and 4.5*2=9 GeV >6 GeV. So that decay is forbidden.

Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy. So when looking at decay options, any option that includes b bbar (like options A and D include b bbar) would be incorrect because that decay is kinematically forbidden.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But X can't decay into b bbar, so option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c is fine because c is about 1.3 GeV, which is <3 GeV.

So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed. But wait, what about other quarks?

Wait, the options list all possible quarks that are allowed.

So in option B, the fermion pairs are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these fermions have masses under 3 GeV.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is way too heavy, so decay into t tbar is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, this includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B, because it includes the allowed fermions and excludes those that are too heavy.

Wait, but let me double-check each fermion's mass.

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV, which is way below 3 GeV.

- Muon: ~105.7 MeV (0.1057 GeV), also below 3 GeV.

- Tau: ~1.78 GeV, below 3 GeV.

- Up: ~2 MeV.

- Down: ~4-5 MeV.

- Strange: ~95-100 MeV.

- Charm: ~1.3 GeV.

- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → too heavy.

- Top: way too heavy.

So in option B, the fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All are allowed.

Wait, but option B says c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+mu-, e+ e-.

So all of these are allowed except for any that are too heavy. So yes, option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decays must involve fermion-antifermion pairs where the combined rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). For a decay into two particles, the rest mass of each particle must be less than \( M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 4.5 > 3 \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 173 > 3 \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( M_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these fermions have masses less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), making this option correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( M_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( M_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are listed in **Option B**.
