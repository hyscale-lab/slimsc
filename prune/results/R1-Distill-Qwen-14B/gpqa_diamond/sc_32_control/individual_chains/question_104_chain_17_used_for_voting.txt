Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that as a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So the shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is proportional to the star's velocity (v). The formula I remember is delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where c is the speed of light. So if the shift is larger, the star's velocity is higher.

But how does this relate to the orbital period of the planet? Oh right, the orbital period of the planet is the same as the star's period because they orbit each other. The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and other factors.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (2π/P)^(1/3) ))

But wait, this might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the ratio of their velocities (K1 and K2) would be related to the inverse cube root of their orbital periods.

Wait, no, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated as proportional to (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ). But since both M_star and M_p are the same for both cases (same star masses and planet masses), the only varying factor is the orbital period P.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun's mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( G^(1/3) * M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) * (1/c )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV method gives K, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K ∝ (2π/P)^(1/3). So if K1 is the velocity for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me think again. Since K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because if P increases, the semi-amplitude K decreases.

Wait, let me set up the proportionality correctly. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so the denominator becomes (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) c)).

So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) c) )

Therefore, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = (constant) / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = (constant) / (P2)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

But the problem states that the shift in the spectral line is proportional to K, because delta lambda is proportional to v (K) since delta lambda/lambda = v/c. So the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for the two planets. Assuming the wavelength lambda is the same for both (same spectral line), then the ratio of the shifts is the same as the ratio of the velocities.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

From the earlier proportionality, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Compute (5/7)^3: 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3645.

So P2/P1 is approximately 0.3645, which means Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.3645 times that of Planet #1. Wait, but the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's. So it's P2 / P1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is longer, the ratio P2/P1 would be greater than 1. But according to our calculation, P2/P1 is 0.3645, which is about 0.36 times. That would imply that P2 is shorter than P1. But that would mean Planet #2 has a shorter period, so it's closer to the star.

Wait, but in our calculation, we have K1/K2 = 5/7, so K2 is larger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K implies a smaller period. So planet 2 has a shorter period.

Wait, but the question is how much longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is shorter, then the ratio would be less than 1. So the answer would be around 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

But let me double-check the math. Let me write down the steps.

Given:

Shift1 = 5 mA
Shift2 = 7 mA

Assuming the same star and same spectral line, the shifts are proportional to K, the velocity semi-amplitude.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)  →  5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → (125)/(343) ≈ 0.3645.

So P2 is approximately 0.3645 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So planet #2's period is about 36% of planet #1's period. So it's not longer; it's shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the answer is option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than that of Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \), the orbital period \( P \), and the Doppler shift of spectral lines. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). Since the Doppler shift is proportional to \( K \), the ratio of the shifts in the spectral lines corresponds to the ratio \( K_1/K_2 \).

Given:
- The shift for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms (\( \Delta \lambda_1 \)).
- The shift for Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms (\( \Delta \lambda_2 \)).

The ratio of the shifts is:
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), we have:
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):
\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:
\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):
\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.3645.
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.3645.
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's, the answer is approximately 0.36 times.
