Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A through D, with various exponents on eV.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The idea is that a state with a shorter lifetime (meaning it decays quickly) has a larger uncertainty in its energy measurement. 

The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But wait, since the time here is given as the lifetime, Δt is roughly the lifetime τ of the state. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ/(2τ). 

So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be based on its lifetime. The energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, actually, the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties of both states. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and you need the separation between E1 and E2 to be more than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or maybe it's more about each state's uncertainty. Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 sec. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, for state 2, ΔE2 is ħ/(2τ2). But since τ2 is larger (1e-8), the uncertainty ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. Because uncertainty decreases with longer lifetime.

I need to calculate ΔE for each state. Let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers. 

First, let's compute ħ in eV·s. Because the options are in eV, maybe it's easier to have the units in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, I divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV. 

So ħ ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. Okay, that's a useful number because it's in eV·s.

So, for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s: 
ΔE1 = ħ / (2τ1) ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) 
= 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 
= 3.291e-7 eV. 

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV. Hmm, that's 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-8 s) 
= 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 
= 3.291e-8 eV. 

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. 

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, right? Because if the separation is less than the sum of uncertainties, the two levels might overlap. So we need ΔE (E2 - E1) > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, let me think. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty, the actual energy of E1 could be uncertain by ±ΔE1, and E2 by ±ΔE2. So the difference in energy needs to be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties for the two to be distinguishable. 

So the minimal ΔE would be when the difference is just larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute that sum:

ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV.

Wait, 3.29e-7 is about 3.29 * 1e-7, and 3.29e-8 is about 0.329 * 1e-7. So sum is around 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV for them to be resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7. No.
B) 1e-11 eV → 0.000001e-7 → even smaller. No.
C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 which is 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 100,000e-7. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4. So compared to 3.6e-7, 1e-4 is much larger (since 1e-4 is 1000 times 1e-7). So 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.6e-7. So option C is a possibility.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify the numbers. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 0.00000036 eV. So yes, the energy difference in option C is much larger than the required minimum, so it can be distinguished.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Hmm, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Which is about 0.027 of 3.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so D is not enough.

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the sum again. 

ΔE1 = 3.291e-7 eV. 

ΔE2 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Sum is 3.291e-7 + 0.3291e-7 = 3.6201e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → 0.0001 * 3.6e-7 → way smaller.

Option B: 1e-11 → negligible.

Option C: 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times 1e-8, or 1e3 times 3.6e-7. So 1e-4 is definitely larger than 3.6e-7. So yes, C is possible and would allow clear distinction.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1 times 3.6e-7 (since 3.6e-7 is 3.6 x1e-7, which is 36e-8; no, wait, 3.6e-7 is 36e-8. So 1e-8 is 1/36th of 3.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so D is not enough.

Wait wait, no, 3.6e-7 is 3.6 x1e-7, which is 36 x1e-8. Oh, right, because 1e-7 is 10 times 1e-8. So 3.6e-7 is 36e-8. So 1e-8 is (1e-8)/(36e-8) ) = 1/36 of the required sum. So the energy difference in option D is 1e-8, which is way below the required 3.6e-7. So option D is not sufficient.

So the only option that is larger than 3.6e-7 is option C, which is 1e-4 eV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The lifetimes are given as 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. But the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties for them to be resolved.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the maximum possible energy difference that can be detected? Or perhaps the minimal that can be detected.

Wait, the question says: which one could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So they need to have a difference larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

So only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So the answer is C.

To determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) to be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) to the lifetime \( \tau \) as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is calculated as follows:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The energy difference between the two states, \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} = E_2 - E_1 \), must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \) for the two states to be distinguishable:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Calculating the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than \( 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.1 \times 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
