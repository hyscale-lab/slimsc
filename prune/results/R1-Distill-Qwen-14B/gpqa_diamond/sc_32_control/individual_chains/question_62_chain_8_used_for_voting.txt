Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the correct sequence of reagents. Let me break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is CH2-OH attached to another cyclohexane ring, and then a formyl group (CHO) is also attached. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring. On carbon 1, there's a substituent: a methyl group which is attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And the cyclohexane ring also has a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde).

Wait, maybe the structure is more like the cyclohexane ring has a methyl group attached, and on that methyl, there's a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent. So it's like cyclohexane with a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group? Or maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the cyclohexane ring, and another aldehyde group. So the molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One is the main ring, and the substituent is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexane (so cyclohexyl), and that same methyl also has a hydroxyl group.

But regardless of the structure, I need to figure out how to get there from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group) attached. So the starting material is CH2Cyclohexane with a triple bond—like cyclohexane with an ethynyl substituent.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So I think we'll need a oxidation step. Also, the substituent has a hydroxyl group, which suggests some kind of addition reaction, maybe a hydration.

So, the process might involve several steps. Let's think about possible reactions.

First, ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various reactions. One common reaction is hydration. If we add water across the triple bond, we can get either an aldehyde or a ketone, depending on the conditions. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group. Oh wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, when you hydrate that, you can get either the ketone or the aldehyde.

Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic conditions (like H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) would give the ketone. So if we have CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane, adding water under acidic conditions would probably give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, because the triple bond is between CH2 and CH. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's attached to the cyclohexane via a carbon. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, that would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. If it's ethynylcyclohexane, the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-H group attached to one of its carbons. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's CH2CH2 cyclohexane with a triple bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure cyclohexane with an ethynyl group attached. So that would be cyclohexyl-ethynyl, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. Ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH attached to one of its carbon atoms. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it directly attached?

Wait, no, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond. Wait, no, ethynyl is a substituent. So it's cyclohexane with a triple bond as a substituent. So, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. No, the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so if the cyclohexane is attached to that, it would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH.

When I add water across the triple bond, under certain conditions, I can get different products. Let's think: in the presence of an acid like H2SO4 and HgSO4, I think the triple bond would add water to form a ketone. But wait, where would the addition occur?

Wait, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So adding water across it would give a carbonyl group. Let's imagine the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Under acidic conditions, hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. Because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, when you add water, the more substituted (more stable) carbocation would form. So the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. When you protonate it, you get CH2-C≡C-H2+. Then, water attacks, perhaps at the more substituted carbon. Wait, perhaps the acetylide is formed first.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents involved. The options given include several reagents. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd. 3. Ba(OH)2. 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for elimination or deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, perhaps a methyl group is being added. Then H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions, perhaps for epoxide openings or for elimination after some substitution.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. 2. Li/liquid NH3. 3. O3, H2O. 4. NH4OH.

Hmm, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would probably do an alkylation. Li in liquid NH3 is for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reactions, but more commonly for deprotonating things, like in elimination.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. 3. O3, (CH3)2S. 4. Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, after the alkylation, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. Then ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol. 2. Li/liq. NH3. 3. O3, (CH3)2S. 4. NH4OH.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about each reagent.

First, in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 (a strong base) with methanol. That might cause deprotonation and alkylation. Methanol as the alkylating agent? Or wait, maybe it's using methanol as a source of methyl groups. But NaNH2 is a strong base that can deprotonate things. If you have a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form an acetylide. Then, if you add methyl chloride, you can alkylate the acetylide. So perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide and then methylating it.

Wait, in all the options, the first step is NaNH2 with something. So in option D, the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol wouldn't provide an alkyl group; perhaps it's used for something else. Wait, wait, maybe the first step in each option is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Let me think.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. NaNH2 is a strong base and would deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, adding an alkylating agent like methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So the first step would form a new alkyne with a methyl group attached.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for example, ethynylcyclohexane would react with NaNH2 to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to give a longer alkyne, cyclohexyl-propargyl? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonating the terminal H on the triple bond (which is acidic) gives cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡^-). Then, treating with CH3Cl would alkylate the acetylide: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexyl-1-propyne, perhaps.

Then, step 2 in some options is hydrogenation. Like in option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd. Hydrogenation of an alkyne would give an alkane, but perhaps with partial hydrogenation, it becomes a cis or trans alkene. Wait, but if you hydrogenate a triple bond, you can go to a single bond. So cyclohexyl-propyne (after step 1) would become cyclohexyl-propyl after hydrogenation. But wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically fully hydrogenate it to a single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two hydrogens.

Wait, but that would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that doesn't add any new functional groups. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is not full. Wait, perhaps step 2 is partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But hydrogenation of alkynes under certain conditions can give either cis or trans alkenes. But with H2 and Pd, it's likely to be a full hydrogenation.

Wait, but perhaps in some conditions, the alkyne can be hydrogenated to a trans alkene. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the target molecule. It has both a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group. So maybe after some steps, we form a double bond, which is then broken by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Looking at the options, some of the steps include O3 (ozone), which is used for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if after a hydrogenation step, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, maybe after forming a di-substituted alkyne, it's hydrogenated to a single bond, but perhaps in another step, an elimination forms a double bond, which is then ozonized.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves forming a diol, then eliminating to form a double bond, then ozonolysis. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about each option's steps.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: forms the acetylide and adds methyl to make a longer alkyne.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane. But that would just add two H's. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. If there's a neighboring group, it could eliminate. But after hydrogenation, the molecule is a single bond. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 would cause some elimination, but I'm not sure. Then, step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the typical conditions for ketone formation from an alkyne, but since the alkyne is already hydrogenated, maybe this is for oxidation. Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in the oxymercuration of alkynes to form ketones, but in this case, the alkyne is gone.

Hmm, not sure about this option.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: so the acetylide is formed and ethylated, making a longer alkyne, like cyclohexyl-1-pentyne? Not sure. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base and can cause elimination or deprotonation. Maybe forms a Grignard-like reagent, but Li is more for Birch reductions or elimination. Then step 3: O3, H2O. Ozonolysis of a double bond. But if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. Then step 4: NH4OH. That's a workup after ozonolysis, maybe for reductive workup.

But wait, after step 1, the alkyne is ethylated to perhaps cyclohexyl-1-propyne (if ethylCl adds a CH2CH3 group). Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a deprotonating agent. Maybe causing elimination to form a double bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkene via deprotonation and elimination? That doesn't make sense, because Li in NH3 is typically for deprotonating, but perhaps with an alkyne, it could cause some reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated in step 2, but I'm not sure.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: makes the acetylide and adds methyl, so cyclohexyl-propyne.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the alkyne to cyclohexyl-propane.
3. O3, (CH3)2S: ozone would need a double bond. But if after step 2, it's a single bond, how does that work? Unless step 3 is ozonolysis of a diene, but where would the diene come from? Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the alkyne but forms a cis or trans alkene. Wait, can H2 and Pd partially hydrogenate an alkyne to an alkene? Because, typically, full hydrogenation is done with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's (for cis) or with a poison for trans. But if it's just H2 and Pd, perhaps it would stop at the alkene. So step 2 would convert the alkyne to an alkene. Then, step 3: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, breaking it into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the product after step 2 would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 (if alkyne becomes single bond) or cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH2 (if alkyne becomes trans alkene). Wait, no, the alkyne after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. Then, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate it to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. So step 3 would be ozonolysis, but there's no double bond, so nothing would happen. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different part. Maybe not the alkyne part. I'm getting a bit confused.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonating the alkyne to form acetylide, then perhaps reacting with methanol. Wait, methanol is CH3OH. If the acetylide is treated with CH3OH, would that add a methyl group via alkylation? Or is it a different reaction? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When you have an alkyne and NaNH2, you get the acetylide. Then, adding CH3Cl (methyl chloride) would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. But in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps the acetylide is reacting with methanol? Would that lead to something else? Methanol is a good nucleophile. The acetylide (strong base) would deprotonate, but methanol is a weak acid. Wait, maybe it's a different kind of reaction, like a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, leading to the alkyne being converted into a ketone or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D's step 1 is adding a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is also attached to another cyclohexane that has a formyl (CHO) group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then some kind of elimination, then oxidation, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydroboration or some hydration. But the options don't include hydroboration. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, but that requires certain steps.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is then attached to another cyclohexane that has a CHO group.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2CHO group (carbaldehyde), and then another cyclohexyl group is added to the same carbon, which would then be oxidized or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a double bond, which is then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reagents.

Option C: after step 1 (alkylation), step 2 is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, so triple bond becomes single. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But if it's a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't work. So maybe in option C, step 2 is hydrogenating the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene, not fully hydrogenated. So if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but earlier I thought H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate an alkyne to a single bond. Unless it's a different catalyst. Wait, sometimes, with certain catalysts, alkynes can hydrogenate to alkenes. For example, using H2 and a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's (palladium with quinoline and lead) would hydrogenate alkynes to cis alkenes. But if the catalyst is just Pd, maybe it goes all the way to the alkane. Hmm. So perhaps step 2 in option C is not a full hydrogenation but stops at the alkene. If that's the case, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the target molecule has only one aldehyde group, so maybe that's where the CHO comes from.

Wait, let me try to outline a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Deprotonate with NaNH2 to form the acetylide.

3. Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride to form cyclohexyl-1-propyne (so structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3).

4. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. If the catalyst is poisoned (like Lindlar's), it becomes cis, but if it's regular Pd, maybe it goes to the alkane. Wait, but option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, no, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd with CaCO3 is usually for alkene hydrogenation. Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is an alkyne. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So perhaps step 2 in option C is not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylating the acetylide, we have an internal alkyne, which upon hydrogenation would give a single bond. Then, perhaps another step forms a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps another approach: after alkylating, we have a longer alkyne, which is partially hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis is used to cleave it into two carbonyls.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 group is attached to both a cyclohexyl group (another cyclohexane ring) and a hydroxyl group (OH). Additionally, the main cyclohexane ring has a formyl group (CHO).

Wait, perhaps the main chain is the cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to another cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group. And there's a formyl group on the same cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol and then oxidizing it to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl, then another cyclohexyl group is added via some alkylation.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to another cyclohexane that has a CHO. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group to a CH2OH group, which is then attached to a cyclohexane that's been oxidized to have a formyl group.

So, perhaps the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then another cyclohexyl group is added via some alkylation, and then an oxidation or some other step forms the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the options don't have all that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a vinyl group, which is then used in a cycloaddition or some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has both a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group. So maybe the synthesis involves introducing an aldehyde via oxidation, and then adding a hydroxyl group via some dihydroxylation or addition.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again, but that seems convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via partial oxidation. Wait, how?

Wait, when you have an alkyne, under certain conditions, you can perform oxymercuration to get a ketone, but that's for internal alkynes. For terminal alkynes, oxymercuration would give a ketone as well, but wait, no, because the triple bond is at the end. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. Let's say, under acidic conditions, the alkyne is hydrated to form a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) would, under H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, form cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-CH3. No, wait, no. Wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Adding water across would give CH2-C(OH)-CH3, but where would the water add? Let me think: the triple bond is between two carbons, each with one substituent. The left is CH2 attached to cyclohexane, and the right is CH. So when you add water, the more substituted side (the CH2 side) would form the carbocation? Or maybe the acetylide is formed, and then the water adds.

Wait, perhaps the hydration of the alkyne would give a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Adding water would give CH2-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)CH3. Which would be a ketone. Because the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups (from the cyclohexane and the CH3).

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via another method. Perhaps through ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: first, the alkyne is alkylated to make a longer alkyne, then hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis breaks the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

So, for example:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making cyclohexyl-1-propyne (CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, not sure. But structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne with H2 and Pd. Wait, but that would make the triple bond single. So it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that's a single bond, no carbonyl. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene. So, if the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butane. Wait, no, that's not possible because hydrogenation of an alkyne would add H2 across the triple bond.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? No, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So after alkylation, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Hydrogenation would add two H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Let me think about the target again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to another cyclohexane with a CHO. So the molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH2 group that has both an OH and a cyclohexyl group attached, and the main ring has a CHO.

So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group to a CH2OH, which is then attached to another cyclohexane with a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the target structure is built by adding substituents to the main cyclohexane ring. So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a formyl group, and another substituent (cyclohexyl) is added.

Wait, but how?

Another approach: think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C: steps are alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2.

After step 1: cyclohexyl-propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So product is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis needs a double bond, but after step 2, it's a single bond. So this doesn't make sense. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: steps are NaNH2 + methanol, Li/liq NH3, O3, NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So the acetylide would attack the methyl group in CH3OH? But that would form a new alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol, leading to the formation of a geminal diol? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, yielding a carbonyl compound. Wait, that's possible. For example, acetylide + H2O would form a ketone, but with methanol, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a new alkyne, like adding a methyl group. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps step 1 in option D is not an alkylation but a substitution. The acetylide could be treated with methanol, leading to a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Option B's steps: alkylation, Li in NH3, ozonolysis, NH4OH.

So, after alkylation, the alkyne becomes longer. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Let's think:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 and ethylCl → cyclohexyl-ethynyl with an ethyl group added.

Wait, ethylCl is CH2CH3Cl. So acetylide + ethylCl would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3?

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. That's a deprotonation, perhaps causing elimination to form a double bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions or for elimination reactions, but in this context, perhaps it's causing the alkyne to become an alkene via elimination. So the triple bond (CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3) becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogen shift during elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is a longer chain, and step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the target molecule.

The target has a formyl group (CHO), which suggests an oxidation. So perhaps one of the steps is oxidation after forming an alcohol.

Looking at the options, some steps involve H2SO4 and HgSO4 (option A) which is for ketone formation from an alkyne, or Ba(OH)2 which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

Wait, perhaps step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which would cause an elimination, forming a double bond. Then, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which would hydrate a triple bond to a ketone, but if step 3 already formed a double bond, maybe step 4 isn't applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the target has both OH and CHO groups. So maybe a diol is formed, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde. So perhaps the molecule undergoes dihydroxylation, then oxidation.

But that would require a double bond to undergo dihydroxylation (like with OsO4), but that's not in any of the options.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the correct sequence.

We need to introduce both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group on a methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane, which also has an aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO) via hydration. Then, a cyclohexyl group is added to the adjacent carbon, perhaps via alkylation. Then, some oxidation or reduction steps to get the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Let me think of the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → hydrate to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group).

2. Then, introduce a substituent (cyclohexyl group) on the adjacent carbon.

3. Then, introduce a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

But the options don't directly support this. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, and then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the options don't include Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, then hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reagents.

In the target molecule, the presence of the OH group suggests some kind of addition or substitution reaction. Maybe an epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps a hydroboration-oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which is then subjected to some reaction.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring with a CHO. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol, then oxidizing it to a ketone, and then further modifying.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think about which option's steps could lead to the desired product.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Assuming step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. The alkyne is deprotonated to form acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Wait, acetylide (strong base) plus methanol (nucleophile) might lead to a substitution. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide attacks the methanol, leading to an alkyne with a methoxy group. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a way that adds a methyl group, but I'm not certain.

Option D's step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, which could deprotonate or cause elimination.

Assuming after step 1, we have a longer alkyne, then step 2 forms a double bond via elimination.

Step 3: O3 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then, step 4: NH4OH is a workup, perhaps for reductive cleavage.

But I'm not sure how this would form the target molecule.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to form a longer alkyne.

2. Partially hydrogenate to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some elimination to form the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, another angle: think about when you use NaNH2 and an alkyl halide. That's a deprotonation followed by alkylation of the acetylide. So step 1 in all options except D is alkylating the acetylide. So after step 1, the alkyne becomes longer.

Then, step 2 varies. In options A, C, and D, step 2 is hydrogenation. In option B, it's Li in NH3.

If step 2 is hydrogenation, then the alkyne becomes an alkane. But then, how do you get a double bond for ozonolysis? That's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction that creates a double bond.

Wait, H2 with a poisoned catalyst can stop at the alkene. For example, using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate an alkyne to a cis-alkene. But in option C, the catalyst is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. I'm not sure if that's poisoned. Calcium carbonate is a support, perhaps not a poison. So Pd without a poison would typically hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to the alkane.

But perhaps in some cases, it could stop at the alkene. I'm not certain.

Assuming that step 2 in option C does form an alkene, then step 3 would be ozonolysis. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

So, after ozonolysis, the molecule would have two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

Wait, but the target only has one carbonyl (CHO), so perhaps only one of the ozonolysis products is relevant.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis is followed by a reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, after ozonolysis, depending on the workup, you can get carbonyl groups. For example, using (CH3)2S as a reductant would typically break the ozonides into aldehydes/ketones.

So, if the alkyne becomes an alkene in step 2, then ozonolysis in step 3 would break it into two carbonyls.

But where would these carbonyls be located?

Let me imagine the molecule after step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Hydrogenation (step 2) would make it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. No double bond, so ozonolysis is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 2, the hydrogenation is incomplete, leaving a double bond.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct answer as option C.

Wait, considering the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to another cyclohexane with a CHO.

Perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to form a double bond (so alkyne → alkene).

3. Ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyls.

4. Ba(OH)2 treatment to form the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination to form the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Alkylate the alkyne → hydrogenate to alkene → ozonolysis to form aldehyde groups → then some treatment to form the hydroxyl group.

But without knowing exactly, I'm not sure.

After considering all the options, I think option D is the correct one. Because:

- Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol could form a methylated acetylide, adding a methyl group.

Wait, no, methanol is CH3OH. Adding it to the acetylide may not add a methyl but perhaps a hydroxymethyl group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because after alkylation and hydrogenation to alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls, and Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination to form the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Option C: Alkylate to form a longer alkyne → hydrogenate to single bond (but then ozonolysis won't work) → so perhaps not.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane or something else. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is for hydrating an alkyne to a ketone. But after step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a base.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → methylated alkyne.

Step 2: H2, Pd → hydrogenate to single bond (alkane).

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination. But the molecule is now an alkane. How does Ba(OH)2 affect it? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening, but there's no epoxide here.

Hmm, not sure.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C. Because after alkylation and hydrogenation, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls, and Ba(OH)2 could cause some elimination or formation of the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: the target has both a hydroxyl and aldehyde group. The aldehyde could come from ozonolysis, and the hydroxyl could come from some addition.

So, in option C, after ozonolysis, you get a carbonyl group, and Ba(OH)2 could perhaps cause some elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, which could then undergo further reactions. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones to form lactones or ketones.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude.

After all this thought, I'll go with option C. Because the steps seem to involve adding a methyl group, hydrogenating to an alkene, ozonolysis to form carbonyls, and Ba(OH)2 possibly for elimination to form the hydroxyl group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the main cyclohexane ring has a formyl group (CHO). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (alkane).
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, potentially for elimination, but the molecule is now an alkane, and no double bond is present for elimination.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Typically used for hydrating alkynes to ketones, but the alkyne has already been hydrogenated, making this step redundant.

This sequence does not align with the target molecule, as the alkyne is fully hydrogenated, and no double bond is present for further reactions like ozonolysis.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, potentially for elimination, but the mechanism for forming a double bond or hydroxyl group is unclear.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the alkyne has not been converted into an alkene, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH4OH**: A workup step after ozonolysis, but the lack of a double bond in the molecule invalidates this sequence.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the alkyne is not converted into a double bond before ozonolysis.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkene. If the catalyst selectively stops at the alkene (e.g., under specific conditions), a double bond is formed.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. This step could generate the aldehyde group in the target molecule.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, potentially for elimination or forming the hydroxyl group on the CH2 group.

This sequence aligns well with the target molecule, as the alkyne is converted into an alkene, ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the formation of the hydroxyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide, which reacts with methanol. The exact reaction mechanism is unclear, but it may involve forming a hydroxymethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, potentially for elimination, but the mechanism for forming a double bond or hydroxyl group is ambiguous.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the alkyne has not been converted into an alkene, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH4OH**: A workup step after ozonolysis, but the lack of a double bond in the molecule invalidates this sequence.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule, as the alkyne is not converted into a double bond before ozonolysis.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. The alkyne is alkylated, hydrogenated to an alkene, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 facilitates the formation of the hydroxyl group.
