Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it. 

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. Both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity affects transit chances, right?

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both host stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. Wait, but if they have the same radius but different masses, that probably means Planet_1's star is more dense, maybe a main-sequence star, while Planet_2's might be a subgiant or something slightly evolved since the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. But I'm not sure if that affects the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Since the question is about which planet has a higher probability, I think the key factors are the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the orbital distance. Wait, no, the formula for transit probability is a bit more involved.

Wait, the probability is given by R_p / a, where R_p is the planet radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, that's only part of it. I think the actual formula is more complex. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The alignment probability is 1/(1+ (a/(R_s)) * (R_p/(R_s))) ), or something like that. Wait, no, I think the probability of an edge-on orbit is about 1/(sqrt(1-e²)) * (R_p/(R_s + a)) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), maybe it's just (R_p/(R_s + a)) * (something else). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_p / a) / (1 + (R_p / a)) )^2, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, another formula I remember is P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 + a/(R_s))) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, some sources say that the transit probability is roughly R_p/(a) divided by (some factor), but maybe I should think in terms of the actual formula. Let me think again. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. Or wait, no, it's more about the geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit, when seen edge-on, will cause it to cross our line of sight. The chance is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, the opposite. If the star is small and the planet is close, the chance is higher.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / a))^-1. Or maybe it's (R_p / a) times something else. Alternatively, the probability is the area of the circle defined by the planet's distance from the star (the orbital radius) and the planet's size. Wait, no, maybe it's about the planet being in the right orientation. Another approach: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I think that's not quite right. Or perhaps it's (R_p / a), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I found some notes before. The transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-2}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is (R_p / R_s) * (1 + (R_p / (R_s + a)))^{-1}, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / (a)) * (something with the impact parameter).

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the transit probability as a function of the planet's orbital distance a and the star's radius R_s. The probability is approximately (R_p / (a R_s)) * something else. Hmm.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / (R_s + a))^2 multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital orientation. But since the orbits are circular and edge-on, the chance is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. But since the orientation is random, the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's path would cause a transit to the total possible area. So, the probability P is (π (R_p)^2) / (π (a)^2 (1 - e²)), but since e=0, it's (R_p/a)^2. But wait, that doesn't account for the actual geometry of the transit. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, I remember that for a star with radius R_s and a planet with radius R_p in an orbit of semi-major axis a, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-1}. Or maybe it's (R_p/(R_s + a)) * (something else). Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the key factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit. Since the host stars have the same radius, but their planets' orbital periods are different. So Planet_1 has a shorter period (3 times shorter) than Planet_2. Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_s)^(1/2), where M_s is the mass of the star. Since Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's (M1=2*M2), and P1 is P2/3.

So P1 = (24h)/3 = 8h if P2 is 24h, but I'm not sure. Let me write down Kepler's third law.

The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p << M_s, we can ignore M_p. So P^2 = (4π²/(G M_s)) a^3.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_s.

So for each planet:

P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³ → a1³ = (G M1 P1²)/(4π²)

P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³ → a2³ = (G M2 P2²)/(4π²)

Since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3.

So substituting, a1³ = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )/(4π²)
a2³ = (G * M2 * P2² )/(4π²)

Dividing a1³ by a2³:

a1³ / a2³ = [ (2 M2) * (P2^2 /9) ) ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ) ] 
= (2/9) * (1) 
= 2/9.

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's compute it. 2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root is about 0.6. Let me compute 0.6³ = 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to theirs, because it has a shorter orbital period and the star is more massive. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Now, transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size and the orbital distance. Wait, the formula I'm trying to recall is that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (1/(1 + a/(R_s))) ), but I think I might be mixing terms. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / (R_s + a)) * something else.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the relative orbital size. No, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, I found a more concrete formula. The geometric probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that can't be right because when a is much larger than R_p + R_s, the probability should approach zero. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm confusing two different factors. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, when seen edge-on, would cross our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but only when a is much larger than R_p + R_s. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Let me think from the beginning. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that, from our perspective, the planet passes directly in front of the star. The probability of this alignment is a function of the sizes of the star and planet and the orbital distance.

The formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / (R_p + R_s)) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the impact parameter. The impact parameter is the distance between the star and planet along the line of sight during transit. For a transit, this impact parameter has to be less than R_s (the star's radius). The probability is the ratio of the area where this occurs to the total possible area.

The area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_s, and the total area is a circle of radius a (the orbital distance). So the probability is (R_s + R_p)^2 / a², but wait, that's if R_p is much smaller than R_s, which it is for Earth-like planets and stars.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )² * (something else?) No, maybe it's just the ratio of areas, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / (a)) * ( (R_p + R_s) / a )^{-1} ), which simplifies to R_p / (a + R_p). But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, I've read that the geometric transit probability is approximately (R_p / (a)) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-1}.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should find a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Because the area of the planet's disk is π R_p², and the area of the star's disk is π R_s². So the ratio is (R_p / R_s)^2. But that's just the area ratio; the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance and the alignment.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the transit probability is the product of two factors: the probability that the orbital inclination is such that the planet transits (which is (R_p + R_s) / a ), and the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the probability that the planet transits is given by (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-1}.

Wait, I found a source that says the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / (a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_p + R_s))^2 ))) ). But no, that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability for a circular orbit is (R_p / (R_s + a))^2 multiplied by some factor, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / (a)) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-2}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model it as the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size and the orbital distance. So for a planet with radius Rp, star radius Rs, and semi-major axis a, the transit probability is:

P = (2 R_p) / (a) * (R_p) / (R_s)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, after some quick research in my mind, I recall that the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (something about the orbital inclination).

Wait, another formula: the probability is (R_p / (a)) * (1 + (R_p / a))^{-1}.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the transit probability as the product of two factors: the geometric probability (which depends on the relative sizes of the planet and star, and the orbital distance) and the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough.

The geometric probability is the chance that, given the correct inclination, the planet will cross our line of sight. The other factor is the probability that the inclination is such that the transit occurs. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the inclination is within the required range is (R_p + R_s) / a.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / (R_s + a)) * (1 + (R_p / (R_s + a)) )

No, perhaps it's:

P = (R_p / (R_s + a)) * (R_p / (R_s + a)) )

Which would be (R_p/(R_s + a))^2.

But that doesn't sound right because larger a would decrease the probability, but a closer planet (smaller a) would increase the probability. Also, the star's radius being the same for both, and the same planet radius, so the one with smaller a would have higher transit probability.

Wait, in this problem, both host stars have the same radius. Let's denote R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

Planet_1's semi-major axis a1 is smaller than Planet_2's a2. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star. From earlier, a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So, for transit probability, if it's proportional to (R_p / (a)) * something, then Planet_1 would have a higher probability because a is smaller.

Wait, but the transit probability also depends on the ratio of the planet's size to the star's. Both planets are Earth-like, so R_p is the same. And the stars have the same radius, so R_p/R_s is the same for both.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance. So, if a is smaller, the planet is closer, which increases the probability of transit because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) 

Which would be (R_p / a) * (R_s / R_s) ) → R_p / a.

So, with a smaller a, higher transit probability. So in this case, Planet_1 has a1=0.6 a2. So (R_p/a1) is larger than (R_p/a2), so Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

But wait, both R_p and R_s are same for both planets. So:

P ∝ (R_p / a)

So P1/P2 = (R_p/a1 ) / (R_p/a2 ) ) = a2 / a1 = 1 / (0.6) ≈ 1.666... So about 1.67 times higher.

Wait, that's about 1.65 times higher, which would make Planet_1 preferred. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, so according to this, a1 is 0.6 a2, so a2/a1 is 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666, so P1 is 1.666 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit. So the correct option would be either C or D. But according to our calculation, it's about 1.65 times higher.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2, which is approximately 0.6 a2. So P1 is (1/0.6) = 1.666 times higher than P2.

But why do the options have C as 1.65 times and D as 2.7 times? Maybe my calculation is missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the relation between a1 and a2. Let's go back to Kepler's third law.

We have:

P1 = P2 /3

M1 = 2 M2

So, using P^2 ∝ a^3 / M.

So,

(P1^2) / (P2^2) = (a1^3 / M1) / (a2^3 / M2 )

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3 / (2 M2) ) / (a2^3 / M2 )

(1/9) = (a1^3) / (2 a2^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

(2 a2^3 ) / 9 = a1^3

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 ≈ 0.2222

Cube root of 0.2222: Let's compute 0.6^3=0.216, so cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Thus, a1 is 0.6 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a), so P1 = (R_p / a1), P2 = (R_p / a2) → P1/P2 = a2 / a1 = (1.666 a1) / a1 = 1.666. So 1.666 times higher.

So 1.666 is about 1.67, which is close to option C's 1.65. So the correct option is C.

But wait, another factor: the star's radius. Wait, wait. The transit probability also depends on (R_p + R_s) / a. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, so the impact parameter must be less than R_s. So the probability is actually (R_p + R_s) / a multiplied by some function, but since R_p << R_s, it's approximately R_s/a.

Wait, another source I just thought of says that the transit probability is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a, but when R_p << R_s, it's (R_s + R_p) ≈ R_s.

So, P ≈ R_s / a.

But in this case, R_s is the same for both stars. So P is inversely proportional to a.

Thus, P1 = R_s / a1, P2 = R_s / a2.

So P1/P2 = a2 / a1 = (1.666 a1) / a1 → 1.666.

So same as before. So the conclusion is the same: Planet_1 has about 1.67 times higher transit probability. So the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability, which depends on the planet's orbital distance \(a\), the star's radius \(R_s\), and the planet's radius \(R_p\). The transit probability is proportional to \(R_p / a\), assuming \(R_p \ll R_s\). Since both planets have the same mass and radius, and their host stars have the same radius, the key factor is the orbital distance \(a\).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Comparison
Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M_s\), where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M_s\) is the star's mass:

- For Planet_1: \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\), and \(M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}\).
- Substituting into the proportionality:  
  \[
  \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{s1}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{(P_2 / 3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 M_{s2}} \cdot \frac{M_{s2}}{a_2^3}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 a_2^3}
  \]
  \[
  a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} a_2^3
  \]
  \[
  a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
  \]

The cube root of \(2/9 \approx 0.222\) is approximately \(0.6\). Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is proportional to \(R_p / a\). Since \(R_p\) and \(R_s\) are the same for both planets, the probability depends only on \(a\). The ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R_p / a_1}{R_p / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6 a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65, close to the calculated value of 1.67.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its shorter orbital period and closer distance to its star. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1, as it has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Answer: C
