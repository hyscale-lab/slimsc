Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. I need to think about how operators and their matrix representations work.

Wait, the state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, the spin states. So first, I should probably normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant. 

The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself should equal 1. So let me compute that. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the inner product is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1 -i² = 1+1 =2.

|2-i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Okay, next part. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, so the matrix elements are zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let's think about the size of the matrix. Since we're dealing with spin states (up and down), it's a 2x2 matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (A_11 and A_22) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (A_12 and A_21) are ħ/2.

Wait, so the matrix looks like:
[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Hmm, that's interesting. What operator has this form? Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because Pauli X is [[0 1],[1 0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, the matrix becomes [[0 ħ/2],[ ħ/2 0 ]]. So the operator in question is (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Right, so the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x. Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A would have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to find the probabilities of measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and also compute the expectation value of A.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are the probabilities of the state being in each eigenstate of the operator A. So perhaps I should find the eigenstates of A and compute the overlap with |alpha>.

Wait, but σ_x's eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are the superposition states. Let me write them down.

The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Because σ_x |+x> = +1 * |+x>, etc.

So, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So, the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

So let's compute the inner product between |alpha> and |+x>, and then square it to get the probability.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

And |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1/(sqrt(2)) )*(1/sqrt(7)) ) ] [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ].

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So, the inner product is (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Simplify the terms inside: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈0.642857. Hmm, option A says 0.64, which is close. But wait, let me check other options.

Wait, but wait, that's (3/sqrt(14))² is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is about 0.64. So option A's first probability is 0.64, which would match this.

But wait, the other probability would be 1 - 9/14 =5/14 ≈0.357, which is about 0.36, which matches option A's second probability of 0.36.

Wait that would make the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So the average value would be the expectation value of A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the expectation value would be the weighted average of its eigenvalues, with weights the probabilities.

So, <A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 ) = [9/14 -5/14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = ħ/7.

Which matches option A's third part, which is ħ/7. So option A would be the correct one.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute the inner product correctly?

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So when I take the inner product with |alpha>, which is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Which simplifies to (1/sqrt(14)) [3 ], as before. So squared magnitude is 9/14.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the state |alpha> again. It's a spin-1/2 state, so the possible measurements of A can indeed be in the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, another approach is to express the operator A in its matrix form and compute the expectation value directly.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ]]. The state |alpha> can be written as a column vector. Let me write it out.

|up> is [1, 0]^T, |down> is [0, 1]^T.

So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T.

So as a vector, it's:

(1+i)/sqrt(7)
(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So to compute the expectation value <A>, we have <alpha| A |alpha>.

So compute A |alpha>, then take the inner product with |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, the expectation value is:

( (1 +i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * A * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So let's compute the product.

First, compute A multiplied by |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the first component is 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
The second component is (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

So A |alpha> is:

( (2 -i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) , (1 +i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

( (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) multiplied by the above vector.

Wait, wait. Wait, the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the inner product is:

( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * (2 -i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)).

So factor out ( ħ/(2 * 7) ) because sqrt(7)*sqrt(7) is 7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 - i) = (2 -i -2i +i²) = (2 -3i -1) → because i² is -1. So 2-1=1, so 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So the sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the inner product is [ 2 ] * ( ħ/(2 *7) ) * 1 → because each term contributes (1-3i and 1+3i sum to 2).

Wait, wait, so:

Each term is (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i² → 2-3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1=1+3i.

So sum is (1-3i + 1+3i ) = 2.

So the entire expression is 2 * ( ħ/(2 *7) ) * 1.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

The inner product is:

( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (2 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ) + ( (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (1 +i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ) )

Each term is:

Term1: (1 -i)(2 -i) * ħ/(2 *7)

Term2: (2 +i)(1 +i) * ħ/(2 *7)

So Term1: (1)(2) + 1*(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1-3i.

Term2: (2)(1) +2(i) +i(1) +i(i) = 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So adding Term1 and Term2: (1-3i)+(1+3i) = 2.

So overall, the inner product is 2 * ħ/(2 *7) ) * ( ) Hmm, wait, no. Because each term is multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) * ( ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ), which is ħ/(2*7). So each term is (something) * ħ/(2*7), and there are two terms adding to 2.

Wait, no, because each term in the inner product is (something) times ħ/(2*7). So the total is (1-3i +1+3i) ) * ħ/(2*7) ) → 2 * ħ/(14) ) → 2 * ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14 ≈0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. Which makes option A correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So yes, that's the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator and calculating the average value of that operator. The state of the electron is given as proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( | \alpha \rangle \)
The normalization condition requires \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). Calculating the inner product:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
These are also the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \)
The probability of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) is the square of the overlap between \( | \alpha \rangle \) and \( |+x\rangle \):
\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2.
\]
Substituting \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right] \), the inner product is:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]
Similarly, the probability of measuring \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) is:
\[
P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = 1 - P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = 1 - \frac{9}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \), \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), and the state \( | \alpha \rangle \), the expectation value is computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) - P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match option **A**.
