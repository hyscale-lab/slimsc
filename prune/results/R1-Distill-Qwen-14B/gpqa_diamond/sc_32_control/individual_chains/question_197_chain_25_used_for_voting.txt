Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to determine which one is the correct product.

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X. Let's break down what each of these tells us.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1 which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, but the 1720 could be a carbonyl. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe there's an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an acid.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak, probably an acidic proton. Could be a carboxylic acid (-COOH) since the O-H in carboxylic acids often shows up around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So maybe two protons in a doublet, which would suggest they are adjacent to substituents that deshield them.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, probably in a para-substituted structure as well. These would be the other two protons in the aromatic ring, possibly ortho to the substituent.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet integrating for 1H. Could be a CH group attached to something else, maybe a carbonyl. Like a CH adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone or an ester).

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet for two protons. These might be from a CH2 group next to a CH or something else. Maybe part of an isopropyl group or a butyl chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. Wait, actually, a doublet? No, wait, the integration is 3H. A doublet usually comes from coupling with one neighboring proton. So, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH that's connected to another group. Like a CH(CH3) group. So, maybe a geminal substituent or something like that. For example, in an isobutyl group, the CH(CH3)2 would have the central CH, and the methyl groups attached to it would split into a septet or something, but wait, here the 1.4 is a d (doublet) with 3H. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: maybe a methyl group adjacent to a CH that's connected to another CH2. Like in a chain, maybe, such as -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Or perhaps it's the methyl group in an isobutyl group attached to something else.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for three protons. A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. This is probably a terminal methyl group in a chain, like a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the 0.9 ppm suggests a CH3 at the end of an ethyl or propyl chain. Because the triplet indicates it's next to a CH2 group which has two protons.

Putting this together, the aromatic part seems to be a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent on the benzene is probably a group that includes a carbonyl and a chain with branching.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, if that's the case, the IR would show a broad peak around 3000 cm-1, but the IR here lists 3400–2500 which is a broad region. The 1720 cm-1 is consistent with a carbonyl, but for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but maybe it's a bit higher if it's an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which matches the 3400–2500 region. So, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, let's think about the structure. The benzene ring is para-substituted with a group that includes a carbonyl and a chain.

Looking at the NMR again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are close to each other. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, that would imply a di-substituted ring, but wait, the integration is 2H for each peak. So, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene where the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent, like a group that's attached to the ring, the protons on either side would be a pair each. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that itself has a CH2 or CH group attached. Let's consider the substituent as a carbonyl group linked to a chain.

Wait, for example, imagine a benzene ring with a substituent like -CO-R, where R is a chain with a branching.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

The 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. Then, the 2.9 ppm m (1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a propanoic acid. Wait, but the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would then be the CH2 next to the CH which is next to the carbonyl.

Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to the CH—so perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group, making it an isopropyl-like structure.

Wait, but in that case, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be a CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propanoic acid group attached to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(propanoic acid substituted with an ethyl group) benzene? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain with a carbonyl. Let's think about a structure like benzene with a substituent that is -(CH2)n-COOH. Wait, but the NMR shows a 1H at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, which might be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. So, maybe it's a structure where the benzoic acid is attached to a branching.

Wait, perhaps it's a 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's think: the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a carbonyl and another chain.

Wait, the NMR shows 1.4 (d) as 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is -CH(CH3)- connected to something. Let me think: for example, the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Let's think: the substituent on the benzene is a group that leads to a chain with a branching point.

Another approach: Let's look at the options and see what they are.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so options A and C are acids, while B and D are just substituted benzenes (alkylbenzenes).

So, if the starting compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, then after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this is a typical reaction for the conversion of carboxylic acids to alkanes. Red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes. The reaction is called the Clemmensen reduction, but wait, no. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Red phosphorus with HI would be another method. Alternatively, maybe it's the use of H2SO4 and heat for dehydration, but that's different.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But for carboxylic acids, another method is needed. Alternatively, using LiAlH4 would reduce the acid to an alcohol. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! I think when you treat a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and an iodide (like HI), it can lead to the formation of an alkane via the elimination of CO2 and the formation of a carbon-iodide intermediate.

Wait, yes, I think the reaction is called the Baeyer-Villiger reduction, but wait, no. Alternatively, another possibility: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI may lead to the formation of an alkane. The mechanism involves the formation of an acid iodide, then elimination of CO2 and HI to form the alkane.

So, if Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, after this reaction, the COOH group would be converted into a CH2 group, or maybe a methyl group, depending on the structure.

Wait, let me think about the structure of Compound X. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then upon reaction with red P and HI, the COOH would be converted into CH2CH2... Hmm, wait, no. Let me think about the reaction in more detail.

The reaction of a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) with red phosphorus and HI typically converts the acid into an alkane. The reaction goes through the formation of an acid iodide (RCO-I) as an intermediate. Then, the acid iodide undergoes elimination, losing CO and HI, to form an alkane. So, RCOOH → RCH2... Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the -COOH group is converted to a methyl group. Wait, no, let me think: the reaction RCOOH → RCH2I via RCO-I, then RCH2I loses HI to form RCH3.

Wait, wait, perhaps the process is: RCOOH + P, HI → RCH2 group. So, for example, if R is a benzene ring, then benzene ring with COOH would become benzene with CH2 after the reaction.

Wait, let's take an example. If the starting material is benzoic acid (C6H5COOH), then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would give toluene (C6H5CH3). Because the COOH is converted into CH3.

Wait, so in general, the reaction reduces the COOH group to a methyl group.

So, applying that to the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group in the para position. Wait, no, para would be in 4-position, so for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), but that would be meta to each other. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the numbering would be that the COOH is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4, which is para.

So, after reaction, the COOH becomes CH3. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group at position 1. Wait, but wait, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have a sec-butyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4. Wait, no, the original substituent was at position 4. Let's clarify.

In option C, the substituents are 4-(sec-butyl) and 1-COOH (since benzoic acid is at position 1). So after reaction, the COOH becomes a methyl. So the new substituents are at 1-CH3 and 4-(sec-butyl). So the product would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. Which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene? Wait, no, because option D has the substituents at 1 and 4, but which one is which.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, position 1 has the sec-butyl, and position 4 has methyl. But in our scenario, the COOH was at position 1, which becomes CH3, and the substituent at 4 is the sec-butyl, so the product would have substituents at 1 (CH3) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the structure would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methyl, which is the substituents swapped.

Hmm, did I get the positions right? Let me think again.

In option C, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzoic acid (COOH) is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. So when the COOH is converted to a methyl, the product would have methyl at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So the product is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option D (since D says 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methyl, but wait, that would imply that the substituents are swapped. Unless I'm misnumbering.

Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. The correct IUPAC name for the product would have the substituents in alphabetical order, but let's see. The substituents are methyl and sec-butyl. The substituents are attached to the ring. So, the numbering would give the lower numbers to the substituents. Let's say if positions 1 and 4 are substituents, their numbering would be in a way that the substituents are at the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting material. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. So, after the reaction, the COOH becomes a methyl at position 1, and the sec-butyl remains at position 4. So the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. Now, the substituents are at 1 and 4, but when naming, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Between methyl and sec-butyl, methyl comes first. So the name would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. Alternatively, another way to write it is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have substituents at 1 and 4, but the substituents are swapped.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the starting material has the substituents at positions 1 and 3, but no, the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the starting substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is not benzoic acid but another structure. Let's reevaluate the initial analysis.

Looking back at the IR and NMR data. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton. The IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which fits a carboxylic acid. So the compound must have a carboxylic acid group.

So the product after reaction would be the alkane.

Now, considering the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, because a para-substituted benzene would have two protons as a doublet each, but how many substituents are present?

Alternatively, the ring could have two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. For example, a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then the ring would have substituents in the para positions, leading to two sets of doublets. So, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons adjacent to one substituent, and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) adjacent to the other.

But in our case, the substituents would be the COOH group and another group. So, in the starting material, the substituents would be at positions 1 and 4: COOH at 1 and another group at 4.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H). So, that suggests that the substituents are in the para positions, and the protons are ortho and para to each substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. No, that wouldn't make sense for para substitution.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is only in one position, but it's a di-substituted group. Alternatively, the substituent is itself a group that has a branching, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a branching group, like a butyl chain attached to the ring, making the ring have substituents in the para position. For example, the substituent could be a group like -CO-O-R, but no, that's an ester. Alternatively, a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached para to the COOH.

So, the substituent on the benzene ring is a COOH group and another group, say, a butyl group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any other peaks that would suggest an ester or other groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a side chain attached to the ring and has a branching.

Looking at the NMR again, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH next to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to that, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the CH. Then, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be a terminal methyl, perhaps as part of a longer chain.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring could be a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be longer than what we have. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group in the para positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows that the substituent's protons are as follows: 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), and 0.9 (CH3). Hmm, that suggests a longer chain. Let me try to sketch the possible structure.

The substituent attached to the benzene has a carbonyl group (from the IR and NMR). So, perhaps the substituent is a phenylpropanoic acid group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propanoic acid substituent that is itself branched.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CO-OH. No, wait, that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the product. If the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group, then the substituent becomes a methyl group. So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene). Looking at the options, that's option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, because the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So, 1 is the position of the methyl, and 4 is the position of the sec-butyl.

Wait, but in option D, it's 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, substituent at position 1 is the sec-butyl, and position 4 is the methyl. But our starting material had the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So after reaction, COOH (position 1) → CH3, and the substituent at position 4 remains as sec-butyl. So, the product would be 1-CH3 and 4-sec-butyl, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a different structure. So that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps option C is the starting material, and the product is not among the options. But that can't be, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is not a benzoic acid but another structure. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure is a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon. So, it's Ph-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be CH2(COOH)-CH2-C6H4-CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps more accurately, it's C6H4-CH2CH3 connected to CH2-COOH.

But then, the NMR of such a structure would have the protons from the ethyl group and the propanoic acid. But the given NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a doublet at 1.4 (3H), a multiplet at 1.7 (2H), and a multiplet at 2.9 (1H). So, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would require more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but that would just be a butyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm t (3H): a terminal methyl in a chain (like CH2CH2CH2CH3)
- 1.4 ppm d (3H): a methyl attached to a CH
- 1.7 ppm m (2H): possibly a CH2 next to a CH
- 2.9 ppm m (1H): a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the ring, which would make it a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH3, but wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, the substituent is a butyl group attached in a way that the branching is at the second carbon. So, for example, a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- would be isobutyl. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The structure of a sec-butyl group is: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the correct IUPAC name for the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents. The substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. That would be a tertiary butyl group. But no, the NMR data suggests a chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent on the benzene is a propanoic acid group attached to a CH2-CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then, the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent that's a propanoic acid connected to a CH(CH3) group.

But then, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH adjacent to the COOH, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to that CH, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the terminal methyl from an ethyl group. But in this structure, I don't see an ethyl group, unless the substituent is longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a chain like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isopropyl group. But then, the NMR would show a septet for the CH3 groups attached to the CH, but here the NMR shows a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm, which would be a methyl attached to a CH, which is not split much, perhaps because it's a doublet from coupling with one neighboring proton.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. So, the substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the ring. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups as multiplets, and the CH would be at 2.9 ppm. The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 as a triplet. The CH(CH3) would have two CH3 groups attached to it, which would show up as a septet or something, but in the NMR given, we have a doublet at 1.4 ppm. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3) group attached to more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a isopropyl group. But then, the CH(CH3) would have two CH3 groups, which would show up as a septet, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests only one adjacent proton.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a single adjacent proton. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is likely a CH adjacent to the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, making it a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, that would be a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branching at the first carbon. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a isopropyl group attached to another CH2. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, which would be a butyl group with a branch at the second carbon.

In that case, the 2.9 ppm would be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl, the 1.7 ppm would be the CH2 next to the CH, the 1.4 ppm would be the methyl attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm would be the terminal methyl from the CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that would make the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a isopropyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit with the 0.9 ppm triplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the first carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Then, the 0.9 ppm would be the terminal methyl of the ethyl group attached to the CH.

Wait, but the substituent would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, which would be a butyl group with a branch. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent that's a -COOH group and a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look back at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1.

So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with:

- COOH at position 1
- sec-butyl group at position 4

Then, the IR and NMR would show:

- COOH proton at 10.5 ppm
- Aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2) due to the substituents in para positions.

The substituent, the sec-butyl group, would have the following protons:

The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that doesn't make sense because butyl has four carbons. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be a pentyl group. No, wait, butyl groups have four carbons. So, the structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: the four carbons are arranged as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a butyl group, but where is the branch? Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituent's NMR. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would have:

- A CH2 group adjacent to the ring
- A CH group adjacent to that CH2, which is attached to a methyl group and another CH2 group.
- The terminal CH2-CH3 group.

So, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet or quartet depending on coupling.
- The CH group would have one proton, as a multiplet.
- The CH2 connected to the CH would have two protons as a quartet or triplet.
- The terminal CH3 would be a triplet.

But looking at the NMR data:

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps the CH group.
The 1.7 ppm (m,2H): perhaps the CH2 next to the CH.
The 1.4 ppm (d,3H): the methyl attached to the CH.
The 0.9 ppm (t,3H): the terminal CH3.

So, in the substituent, the CH2 next to the ring would have two protons, but in the NMR data, we don't see a peak for that. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not a butyl group but something else. Let me think again.

The substituent's NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 next to that CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl attached to the CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH3.

So, that suggests a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a butyl group. Specifically, it would be a tert-butyl group if the branching is at the second carbon. Hmm, no, because in that case, the CH(CH3) would have two CH3 groups attached, leading to a septet for the CH3 protons.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests that the methyl group is attached to a single neighboring proton. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group, but that would only account for the methyl. Then, the chain continues.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group with a branch. Then, the 2.9 ppm would be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl, the 1.7 ppm would be the CH2 next to that, and the 0.9 ppm would be the terminal methyl. But the 1.4 ppm would be the methyl attached to the CH.

So, the substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group in the para position.

In that case, the NMR would show the following:

- The CH(CH3) would have 1H at 2.9 ppm (m).
- The CH2 next to that would have 2H at 1.7 ppm (m).
- The methyl attached to the CH would have 3H at 1.4 ppm (d).
- The terminal CH3 would have 3H at 0.9 ppm (t).

That fits the given NMR data.

So, the starting material is 4-(pentyl?)benzoic acid. But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, is the substituent a sec-butyl group?

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. So, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring: 2H, likely as a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH).
- The CH in the middle: 1H, as a multiplet.
- The CH2 at the end: 2H, as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH).
- The terminal CH3: 3H, as a triplet.

But in the given NMR data, the 1.7 ppm is 2H (m), which would correspond to the CH2 next to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal CH3. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is the CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, but in the sec-butyl group, the CH is attached to two CH2 groups and a methyl. So, the CH would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting. But according to the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests that the methyl is attached to a single neighboring proton. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group, but that doesn't fit the butyl structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isopropyl group, but that would only account for three carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the reaction. The starting material X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form a product. X has a COOH group, which will be converted to a CH3 group.

So, the product after reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid). So, the product would have substituents at positions 1 (CH3) and 4 (sec-butyl). So, the product's structure is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that's substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). But according to our analysis, the substituents should be at 1 (methyl) and 4 (sec-butyl). So, that would make the product 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have the substituents at positions 1 and 4, with substituents being sec-butyl and methyl, respectively. So, the product would have a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But according to the starting material, the substituent was at position 4, so after reaction, it's still at position 4. So, perhaps I'm misnumbering the substituents.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are arranged such that after the reaction, the product has the substituents at positions 1 and 4, but the substituent at position 4 is the methyl, and the substituent at position 1 is the sec-butyl. But that would require the starting material to have substituents at positions 1 and 4 as COOH and sec-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is benzene with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So, after reaction, the COOH becomes CH3, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which has substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). So, this would correspond to a starting material where the substituents were at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (COOH). So, the starting material would be 4-carboxy-1-(sec-butyl)benzene.

But according to the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which would correspond to substituents at positions 1 and 4. So, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, leading to option D as the product.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. Position 1 has the COOH, and position 4 has the sec-butyl. After reaction, position 1 becomes CH3, and position 4 remains sec-butyl. So, the product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, but that would have substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). Wait, no, that's not correct because the substituent at position 4 was the sec-butyl, so after reaction, it's still there, and position 1 becomes CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 4 and 1, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). So, the starting material would have substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (COOH). So, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But wait, no, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). After reaction, position 1 becomes CH3, and position 4 remains sec-butyl. So, the product would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is not one of the options. So, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But the options don't have this structure. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure is phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid via the second carbon.

But the NMR data shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would correspond to the ethyl group in option A. So, perhaps the substituent is a phenylethyl group attached to the propanoic acid.

In that case, the NMR would have peaks for the ethyl group (0.9 t, 1.4 d, etc.), which matches the given data.

But then, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH would become a methyl group, leading to a structure where the substituent is CH2CH2Ph attached to CH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the starting material is option A, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, then the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl.

Upon reaction, the COOH becomes CH3, so the product would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propane, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a phenyl group but a butyl group.

Looking back, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the NMR and match it with the options.

The given NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal methyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 group.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The substituents would be a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. The substituent groups would have the following protons:

- The sec-butyl group: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (position 1) as a triplet or quartet.
- The CH in the middle as a multiplet.
- The terminal CH3 as a triplet.

But according to the given NMR, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal methyl. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl attached to the CH.

So, in option D, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the CH(CH3) group. The CH(CH3) would have two CH3 groups attached, leading to a septet for the CH3 protons. But in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which doesn't match.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct starting material. Let me imagine the starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and COOH at position 1.

The substituent's protons would be:

- CH2 next to the ring: 2H, likely as a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH).
- CH in the middle: 1H, as a multiplet.
- CH2 at the end: 2H, as a triplet.
- Terminal CH3: 3H, as a triplet.

But the NMR data doesn't show a peak for the CH2 next to the ring, which would be at around 1.3-1.5 ppm, perhaps as a quartet. But the given NMR has a peak at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be the CH2 next to the CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a different group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it an isopropyl group attached to another CH2.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The product after reaction is the alkane. So, the product options are:

A) A propanoic acid derivative.

B) An isobutyl-methylbenzene.

C) A benzoic acid derivative.

D) A sec-butyl-methylbenzene.

So, the correct product must be an alkylbenzene, so options B and D are possible.

But the starting material must have a COOH group, so options A and C are acids.

So, the reaction reduces the acid to an alkane.

If option C is the starting material, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D (since option D has 1-(sec-butyl) and 4-methyl). Wait, no, because option D's substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but the product would have the substituents at 1 (methyl) and 4 (sec-butyl).

Wait, unless the substituents are swapped in numbering. For example, in the product, the substituents are at 1 and 4, but the name would prioritize the substituents alphabetically. So, the substituents are methyl and sec-butyl. The correct IUPAC name would have the substituents ordered alphabetically, so methyl comes first, then sec-butyl.

So, the product would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are at 1 and 4, but their positions are swapped in the name.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is option D, so the starting material must have substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (COOH). Then, after reaction, the COOH becomes methyl, leading to substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl), which is option D.

Looking back at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are 8.0 and 7.2, which would be consistent with substituents at positions 1 and 4. So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), after reaction, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is not listed, but option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is option D, but that would make no sense because option D is an alkylbenzene, not an acid.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to determine the structure of X from the NMR and then determine the product.

Given that X's NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is COOH, and the aromatic protons suggest para substitution, the structure is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

The substituent's NMR suggests a chain with a methyl, a CH, and a CH2 group.

Putting it all together, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to a CH2CH2 group.

But perhaps it's easier to think that the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it an isopropyl group. But that would only account for three carbons.

Another approach: the substituent's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

So, the substituent is likely a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Thus, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). After reaction, the COOH becomes a methyl group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But this isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct option is D, but the substituents are numbered differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 5, but no, that's not matching the NMR.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the analysis, the correct product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided for Compound X suggest the following:

1. **IR Analysis**:  
   - A broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid (-COOH).  
   - A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching.

2. **NMR Analysis**:  
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, consistent with the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.  
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.  
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.  
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in a chain.

From the NMR data, the substituent on the benzene ring is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-). The para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring is consistent with the aromatic proton signals.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, the starting material, **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), undergoes this transformation to yield **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**. This product has a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 on the benzene ring.

### Matching with Options
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. This is incorrect because the starting material is not a propanoic acid derivative.  
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is incorrect because the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.  
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This is the starting material, not the product.  
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches the product formed after the reaction, where the carboxylic acid group is reduced to a methyl group.

### Conclusion
The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), and the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (option D). 

Answer: D
