Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopy data. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec were used. Let me go through each one and see what information they provide.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the question says it's a very broad peak—maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids can sometimes have a broader, but perhaps it's an O-H from something else. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Oh, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But what kind? If it's a ketone, it's around 1700. The peak at 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch) or maybe another carbonyl, but 1650 is a bit lower. Wait, maybe it's an ester or an amide? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That could explain the 1700 and 1650. Or maybe it's a conjugated double bond, like in an enone system.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're on a double bond, so the compound has some double bonds. So maybe it's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring or a diene. Also, the presence of O-H might suggest something like an allylic alcohol or a phenol?

Then the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include CH3CHO (which is 45?), wait, let's calculate. CH3CHO is C2H4O, which is (12*2)+(4)+(16)=24+4+16=44. Oh wait, no, 45 is maybe CH2O (which is 30) but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe something like (CH3)2CO could lose some groups. Wait, maybe it's the loss of an ester group. Alternatively, the m/z 45 could be a fragment from a carbonyl-containing group. Let's think: 45 could be the molecular ion for something like C3H7O or so. Wait, 3 carbons: 3*12=36, plus 7 H's: 7, plus O:16. Total 36+7+16=59, which is higher than 45. Hmm. Maybe it's a ketone. Or perhaps it's a smaller fragment, like a ketone group.

Wait, another approach: common fragments. The m/z 45 is a significant peak. I remember that in mass spectrometry, the loss of certain groups can lead to characteristic fragments. For example, if a molecule loses a neutral fragment, like H2O (18), then the remaining part would have a m/z of the original minus 18. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Looking at the options: the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me think about each and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. So that's like two oxygen atoms. Possible functional groups could be ester, ether, perhaps a ketone and an alcohol, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a carbonyl group.

Option B: C6H10O. One oxygen. Maybe an alcohol or an ether. But the FTIR shows a broad peak, which would suggest an O-H. So if it's an alcohol, that's possible. But then, the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. That would need a carbonyl group. So this option might not fit because it's only one O. Unless it's an enol or something, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygens. Could be ester, ether, and another O somewhere. For example, an ester has a carbonyl, which would explain the 1700. Then another functional group with O, like an ether or an alcohol. But then the IR shows a broad peak, so maybe an alcohol group. If it's an ester and an alcohol, perhaps, but that would need more carbons.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. So maybe an alcohol and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, one O can't have both. Unless it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require two O's.

Wait, no, wait. The FTIR has a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group. So the options must have at least one O for that. Let's see:

Option B: C6H10O. So one O. If that's a carbonyl, then that's possible. Like a ketone or aldehyde. But there's also a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H. Hmm, but if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two O's. So that's a problem because option B only has one O. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, but maybe it's an α,β-unsaturated ketone? Because the peak at 1650 could be the conjugated double bond in that case. So, for example, a compound like cyclohexenone or something similar. If it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond, then the IR would show the strong 1700 (ketone) and a peak around 1650 for the conjugated double bond.

But then, what about the O-H peak? If the compound has an O-H, then the formula must include two O's. Because a ketone is O, and an O-H is another O. So this would require two O's.

Looking back at the options, options A and C have two O's. So perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group or an ester or something.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR has a broad peak, which is O-H. So that's an -OH group. So the compound has a carbonyl (probably a ketone or ester) and an O-H. So the formula must have at least two O's. So options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) are possibilities.

Now, looking at the NMR. Vinyl hydrogens are present, so either an alkene or an aromatic ring. But since the mass seems to be lower, maybe an alkene. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated diene or a mono-ene with a carbonyl.

What about the mass spectrum? The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about the possible structures that could give that.

If it's an ester, for example, the ester group would have the carbonyl. The formula for the ester would be R-O-CO-R'. When it breaks, maybe it loses a part and leaves a fragment with m/z 45.

Alternatively, the 45 could come from a ketone like acetone (which is (CH3)2CO). The molecular weight of acetone is 58 (12*3 + 6 + 16). If the parent ion loses a fragment, maybe a larger structure breaks off to leave acetone's ion?

Wait, but the fragment is m/z 45. Let me calculate the molecular weight of possible fragments. Let's see, 45 can be C3H7O, since 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59? No, that's too high. Wait, perhaps it's C2H5O. 2*12=24, 5=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh, yes, that adds up. So C2H5O. What's that? That's methyl vinyl ether (CH2=CH-O-CH3? No, wait, that's more than two carbons. Or perhaps something else. Wait, another way: the molecular formula for the fragment could be C2H5O. So, maybe it's an ethoxy group or something similar.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a ketone. Let's think about that. If the compound has an acetate group, perhaps. Or maybe it's a loss of something like (CH3)2CO (acetone) which is 58, but the fragment is 45, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion? No, I think that's more complicated. Alternatively, the m/z 45 could come from a CH3COO- group. Wait, CH3COO- has a molecular weight of 60 (12*2 + 3*1 + 16*2 = 24+3+32=59). Close but not 45. Hmm.

Another approach: think about the possible molecular formulas and their degrees of unsaturation.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X and N are zero. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. DoU is 1. So one ring or double bond. But since the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, that indicates at least one double bond, so DoU would be at least 1. So this could be a molecule with one double bond and maybe one ring, but that's possible.

B) C6H10O: DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. Possible.

C) C6H10O2: DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds.

D) C6H12O: DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

From the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the DoU must be at least 1, all options have that except D? Wait, D has DoU 1. So in the case of D, if there's a double bond, that would account for the DoU. But the IR shows a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl. So D has only one O, and that must be the carbonyl. So a ketone. So, for option D, the structure would be a ketone with a double bond.

But then, the FTIR also has a broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which suggests an O-H group. Wait, but option D has only one O. So a ketone (using the O) and an O-H would require two O's. But option D only has one O. So that's a problem. So option D is probably not the right answer.

So, back to options A and C. Both have two O's. So perhaps the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl group.

So, the structure could be something like a cyclic ester (lactone), but that would have an ester group, which is O-CO-O. Alternatively, it could be an ester and an alcohol. But perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So maybe it's a dienol ether or something with a conjugated diene and an ether. Or, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, what does that correspond to? Another approach: the molecular ion of the compound would be the sum of all the atoms. Let's consider each option's molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option C: C6H10O2. (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

So the molecular ions would be around 116 and 114 respectively.

But the fragment is at 45. So the parent ion breaks into a part of 45 and the rest. Maybe a part of the molecule with a molecular weight of 45.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Suppose the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, methyl vinyl acetate would be something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has the formula C5H8O2. But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the compound is a diene. Or perhaps it's a cyclic diene with an ester group or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So these could be in a conjugated system with the carbonyl. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone would have a carbonyl and a double bond. However, it's a ketone, so O is present. But that would be C6H10O. So option B. But earlier, I thought that option B can't have both the carbonyl and the O-H because it only has one O. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine.

So, if the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone) and an O-H (like an alcohol), then the formula must have two O's. Because a ketone is O and an alcohol is O. So the formula would need two O's. So only options A and C have that.

So, options A and C: which one fits the other data.

Let me think about the IR. The peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggest a conjugated carbonyl group. So perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. So, for example, something like (E)-3-penten-2-one. Which would have a conjugated double bond (so the 1650 peak) and a ketone (1700).

In such a case, the molecule would have a double bond and a ketone. But where's the O-H? Oh, wait—maybe the molecule also has an -OH group. So perhaps a dienol or something similar. Wait, but dienols are more like conjugated dienes with an alcohol group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. 1700 is a strong C=O. If the 1650 is also a C=C, then the carbonyl is conjugated to the double bond. So, that would explain the lower wavenumber for the C=C. So the structure could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

So, let's say the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The ester group has a carbonyl, so that's the 1700 peak. The conjugated double bond would be at 1650. Then, the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 would indicate an O-H group, perhaps from an alcohol.

Wait, but an ester is O-CO-O. So, two oxygen atoms from the ester. But if the compound has another O-H group, then that would require a third O, which doesn't fit any of the options. So perhaps the O-H is part of the ester group? No, esters don't have O-H groups. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a phenolic group. But I don't see any indication of aromatic protons in the NMR description. The NMR only mentions vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic ones. So maybe it's not a phenol.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a secondary alcohol, which is conjugated to the carbonyl group. So, for example, a cyclohexenone with an adjacent alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Now, looking at the mass spec again. If the fragment is at m/z 45, perhaps that comes from a ketone. Let's think of the molecular formula of the parent ion. Let's say the molecular ion is at 114 (for option C: C6H10O2). If the molecule breaks into a fragment with 45, then the rest would be 114-45=69. But I'm not sure what that signifies.

Alternatively, the fragment might be a characteristic ion from a specific functional group. For example, in esters, the loss of the R-O group can leave the acylium ion. The acylium ion for an acetate group would be CH3CO+, which has a m/z of 43. Hmm, close but not 45. Wait, but if it's a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-), the fragment would be CH2CH2CO+, which is 58. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 45 is from the acetate ion (CH3COO-) which is 60. But that's not 45. Alternatively, the loss of something else.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion (RCO), which would have a molecular weight of RCO. For example, if R is CH2CH2-, then RCO would be C3H4O. The molecular weight is (3*12)+(4)+(16)=36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures include esters, cyclic esters, or possibly a diol with a ketone. Alternatively, maybe a diester, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would account for the conjugated carbonyl and double bond.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which would fit with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Also, the IR would show the strong C=O at 1700 and the conjugated C=C at 1650. Then, the broad peak at 3000 could be an O-H from an alcohol group. But wait, an ester doesn't have an O-H. So perhaps the O-H is from another functional group.

Wait, the formula for option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. So maybe an ester and an alcohol? But that would require two more oxygens, which isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester (lactone). A lactone has an ester functional group, which would have the carbonyl. But where would the O-H come from?

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl. But that would require more oxygens. No, all options have limited oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about possible molecular formulas and how they fit with the mass spec.

Suppose the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). The molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +2*16=72+10+32=114.

In mass spectrometry, the molecule can fragment. One possible fragment is the loss of a part, such as the ester group, leaving a smaller molecule. For example, if the structure is an ester, the loss of the R-O- group would leave the acylium ion. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into two parts, one of which has a molecular weight of 45.

What functional groups have a mass of 45? Let me think: maybe a CH3COO group (45). Wait, CH3COO is 45 (12*2 + 3 +16*2=24+3+32=59? No, that's 59. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group (30). No, that's too low. Alternatively, maybe a ketone group. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is molecular weight 58. No, that's higher than 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen. Let's see: CH2CH2O has a molecular weight of 3*12 + 6 +16=36+6+16=58. No. Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to oxygen, like CH3O. That would be 31. No, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. The molecular weight of a ketene would be R-CO. For example, propanone would be (CH3)2CO, but we're looking at a fragment. Wait, propenoyl would be CH2CHCO, which has a molecular weight of 56. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a different part. Suppose the molecule is an ester with a six-membered ring. For example, methyl cyclohex-2-enoate. The structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a cyclohexene ring. The molecular formula would be C7H10O2. But that's more than our options, which are all C6.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the molecular formula and the possible functional groups.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's see what degrees of unsaturation that is. DoU is 2. So two rings or double bonds. If it's a conjugated system, perhaps it's a six-membered ring with a double bond and an ester group, or a dienol ester.

Alternatively, it's an ester and an adjacent double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but with R being something else. Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be C6H10O2. Wait, that's 6 carbons: three from the ester (CH2CHCOO), and three from the ester's R group (CH2CH2CH3 is four carbons?), wait, no. Let me count: CH2=CHCOO- is 4 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-), then the R would be CH2CH2CH3? No, because that would make more than six. Hmm, perhaps it's a smaller R group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester group. Like gamma-butyrolactone, but that's only four carbons.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl ketone. The formula for that is C5H8O. But our options are C6, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl maleate or something, but that's probably more than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like cyclohexene with an ester group and an O-H. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to think again about the mass fragment. 45. Let me think of possible ions that have 45.

The molecular formula for the fragment could be C3H7O. Because 3*12=36, 7=7, O=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the loss of a larger part, leaving a smaller ion. Let's say the parent ion is 114 (option C). If the molecule loses a fragment of 69 (114 -45=69), but I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a methylene group with some oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about common substituents. For example, the loss of a water molecule (18) from a larger fragment. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a ketone, but I can't find any.

Wait, another thought: the formula C3H5O. That would be 3*12=36, 5=5, 16=16. Total 57. Not 45.

Hmm. Maybe it's a CH2O group (30), but that's too low. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CH2O group (45? 29: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh! Wait, that adds up. So CH3CH2O would have a molecular weight of 45. So the fragment is CH2CH2O+? Or perhaps that's the ion.

So in the mass spec, the fragment at m/z 45 could be CH2CH2O+. So that would suggest that the parent molecule has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) attached somewhere. Because when the molecule breaks, the ethoxy group remains as a fragment.

If that's the case, then the parent molecule contains an ethoxy group. So the formula would have an OCH2CH3 group, which contributes two O's? Wait, no, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which has one O.

Wait, but the parent formula has two O's (options A and C). So if the ethoxy group is part of an ester, then the other O would come from the ester. For example, if it's an ethyl propionate, the formula would be C5H10O2. But our options are C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A).

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. So maybe the structure is ethyl something with a conjugated carbonyl. Like ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt. Let me calculate the formula for that. CH2=CHCOOEt is C5H8O2. No, that's five carbons. Not matching. But our option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ethyl vinyl ketone. The formula for ethyl vinyl ketone is C5H8O. But that's one O, which doesn't fit options A and C.

Wait, but if the parent molecule has an ethoxy group and another oxygen, perhaps an ester and an ether. But that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic hemiacetal with an ester group. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another clue. The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. So the formula must have at least two O's because the carbonyl is another O. So options A and C.

Now, looking at the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the compound has a double bond. The IR has a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C, conjugated). So it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So the structure could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula is C4H6O2. But our options are C6. So perhaps the structure is a six-carbon version, like ethyl something.

Wait, another example: butyl acrylate would be longer. Let me see: structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Formula would be C7H10O2. That's more than our options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is a six-membered ring with an ester and a conjugated double bond. Like a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures include esters (like methyl cyclohexanoate), but esters have the O-H? No, esters don't have O-H. So if the O-H is present, then it's an alcohol. So perhaps an ester and an alcohol? That would require more O's, but the formula only has two O's. So maybe an ester and a hydroxyl group? But then, the O's come from the ester (two O's) and the OH (another O?), but that would make three O's, which is not possible. So perhaps option A doesn't fit because it can't have both an O-H and a carbonyl, considering the formula.

Wait, unless the O's are shared. For example, if it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which has an ester group (O-CO-O) but no free O-H. Hmm, but the IR shows a broad O-H peak, so it must have an O-H. So perhaps the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl, but that doesn't fit with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the O's are part of a ketone and an ester. But that would require three O's. Hmm.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to sum up the information:

- FTIR: O-H (broad peak), C=O (1700), C=C (1650, conjugated)
- NMR: vinyl H's
- Mass Spec: fragment at 45.

So the compound has a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, an O-H group, and a mass fragment of 45.

The formula must have two O's (since we have O-H and C=O). So options A and C.

The presence of an O-H suggests either an alcohol or phenol. But since the NMR doesn't mention aromatic protons, it's likely an alcohol.

So the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Wait, but that would require three O's. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal with an ester group. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's see if that fits the mass fragment of 45. The molecular weight is 114. If the parent ion loses a fragment of 69 (114 -45=69), but I don't know the significance of that. Alternatively, if the fragment is 45, which is part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: the 45 could be the loss of a water molecule (18) from a 63 fragment. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acetate ion (45 is not matching), but earlier I thought that was 58.

Wait, maybe the fragment comes from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then losing R'CO would leave R-O as a fragment. If R is CH2CH3 (ethyl), then R-O is CH2CH2O, which is 45. Yes! So the fragment at 45 could be CH2CH2O+.

In that case, the parent molecule would be an ester with an ethoxy group. So, for example, ethyl something-ate. Let's see:

The ester formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula for RCOOCH2CH3 is (n+2) carbons, where R is (n) carbons. Because RCOO is (n+1) carbons, and OCH2CH3 is two. So total n+3.

Wait, our options are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.

So, RCOOCH2CH3 would have (n+3) carbons. So if n+3=6, then n=3. So R is propyl. So the ester would be propanoate ethyl ester: CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That would be C5H10O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So that's one more carbon.

Wait, maybe R is butyl. Then RCOO would be butyl, making the ester C5H10O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is cyclohexenone with an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the parent could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethoxy group. Not likely.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester with the formula RCOOR', where R is (m) carbons and R' is (n) carbons, then m + n + 2 (from COO) should equal 6. So m + n + 2 =6 → m +n=4.

Possible combinations: m=3, n=1; m=2, n=2; m=1, n=3.

So possible structures:

- Ethyl propanoate: CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3 → but that's C5H10O2. No, not matching.

Wait, but our formula is C6H10O2. So perhaps the ester is part of a ring. Like a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethoxy group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted ester with an ethoxy group and a conjugated double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to think of the possible structure that fits all the data.

If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group, but that would require three O's. So perhaps it isn't that.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of the ester group. Like a hemiacetal ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a conjugated system, like in a dienol. But again, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR shows strong C=O and C=C, and O-H. So the structure must have all three. But with only two O's available, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol adjacent to the carbonyl, making it an alpha-hydroxy ketone. But alpha-hydroxy ketones have the structure RCOHOR', but I'm not sure.

Wait, in that case, the IR would show a broad O-H (the alcohol), a strong C=O (the ketone), and a conjugated C=C. So the structure could be something like cyclohexenone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. But how does that fit the formula?

Let me think: cyclohexenone is C6H10O. But that's option B, which only has one O. So no, that's not possible. Therefore, the compound must have two O's, so perhaps it's a diester or another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal with a ketone. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2CH2COO-R.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the answer based on elimination.

The options are A, B, C, D.

We established that D (C6H12O) can't have both O-H and C=O. So D is out.

Option B (C6H10O) also can't have both O-H and C=O because it only has one O.

So the answer must be either A or C.

Now, between A and C: option A is C6H12O2, which has a higher H count (12 vs 10 in C). So the H count is higher, implying less rings or double bonds.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So the DoU for option A is 1 (6*2+2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option C's DoU is 2. So either two double bonds, two rings, or one of each.

The IR shows peaks for C=O and C=C (conjugated). So for option A, which has one DoU, the structure would have either a double bond or a ring, but not both. But the IR shows both C=O and C=C, so that would require two DoU. So option A (DoU=1) can't have both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. Therefore, option A is unlikely.

So option C is more likely because it has two DoU, which can account for both the carbonyl and the conjugated double bond.

So the structure would have both a C=O and a C=C, and an O-H group.

So the formula must be C6H10O2, which is option C.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol).
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C), respectively.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to CH$_3$CH$_2$O$^+$ (ethoxy group).

4. **Possible Functional Groups**:
   - The compound must contain both an O-H group and a carbonyl group, as indicated by the FTIR data. This requires at least two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula.
   - The presence of vinyl hydrogens and conjugated C=C in the IR spectrum suggests a conjugated system, likely an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**  
  - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, which accounts for one ring or double bond.  
  - However, the IR data indicates two unsaturation features (C=O and C=C), requiring at least two DoU.  
  - Therefore, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**  
  - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2, which could account for the C=O and C=C.  
  - However, this formula contains only one oxygen atom, which cannot accommodate both the O-H and C=O groups.  
  - Thus, this option is invalid.

- **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**  
  - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2, which matches the two unsaturation features (C=O and C=C).  
  - The two oxygen atoms allow for both the O-H and C=O groups.  
  - The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 can be explained by the presence of an ethoxy group (CH$_3$CH$_2$O$^+$).  
  - This option fits all the data.

- **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**  
  - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, which cannot account for the two unsaturation features (C=O and C=C).  
  - Additionally, this formula contains only one oxygen atom, which cannot accommodate both the O-H and C=O groups.  
  - Therefore, this option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have the molecular formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, as it satisfies all the spectroscopic data, including the presence of an O-H group, a conjugated carbonyl, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45.
