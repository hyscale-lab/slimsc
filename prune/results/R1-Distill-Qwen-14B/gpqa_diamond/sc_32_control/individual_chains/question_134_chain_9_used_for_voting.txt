Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. Wait, but since we're mixing three solutions, I need to figure out how they all interact.

First, I should probably figure out what each acid and base does in the reaction. So, HCl is a strong acid, and I think it dissociates completely in water to give H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid; I remember that it's also a strong acid, but wait, how does it dissociate? I think the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- ? No, wait, isn't the first H+ fully dissociated, and the second one only partially? Oh wait, no, wait, in dilute solutions, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ ions are released. Or maybe only the first one is strong, and the second is weak. Hmm, I might have to double-check that. For the purposes of neutralization calculations, maybe it's considered that each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. I think it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the reaction is acid + base → salt + water. The neutralization reaction releases heat, so it's exothermic. The enthalpy change is usually given per mole of reaction, typically per mole of acid or base involved.

But the problem here is a bit more complicated because there are three solutions. So I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution, find out the total H+ and OH- available, and then see what the limiting reagent is because that will determine how much reaction occurs.

Let me list out the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
4. Sum all H+ and OH- to see which is in excess.
5. Determine the amount of neutralization that occurs.
6. Use the enthalpy of neutralization value to calculate the total heat released.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will react. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's providing OH- ions. The acids (HCl and H2SO4) are providing H+ ions. So the overall reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to produce water, releasing heat.

But wait, H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per molecule, right? So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- per mole of the compound.

So let's compute the moles:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl → H+ + Cl-, each mole gives 1 mole H+. So 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M, so moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, so total H+ available from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- available is 0.2 moles.

So the H+ is in excess because 0.28 > 0.2. So all the OH- will be neutralized, leaving some H+ unreacted.

The reaction will proceed as H+ + OH- → H2O, and the number of moles of water formed is equal to the moles of OH- available, which is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So neutralization will use up 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-, producing 0.2 moles H2O. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles from the HCl and H2SO4.

But wait, does the excess H+ affect the enthalpy calculation? Because the neutralization is only for the amount that reacts. So the enthalpy will depend only on the 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

But wait, wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole provides two H+ ions. So in the presence of a strong base, both H+ ions would react. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it provides OH- ions. So the reaction would consume H+ and OH- in a 1:1 ratio.

So the net reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases a certain amount of heat. For strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ reacted. Wait, but wait, the value I remember is about -57 kJ/mol for the reaction of one mole of H+ and one mole of OH- to form water.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these three are mixed. So I think the approach is to compute the total H+ and OH- available, determine how much reacts, and then calculate the total enthalpy change based on that.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol, but each provides 2 H+, so 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- available is 0.2 mol.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- will use up 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-, producing 0.2 mol of H2O. The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol. But that doesn't react further because there's no OH- left.

Wait, but wait. Another point to consider: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When it reacts with H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, perhaps the second H+ from H2SO4 might not react if the OH- is already consumed. But in this case, since Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-, and the total H+ is 0.28, the OH- will take 0.2 H+.

So, the total neutralization is 0.2 mol.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization for each mole of H+ reacting is typically about -57 kJ/mol. But wait, sometimes it's given per mole of acid, so for H2SO4, which contributes 2 H+ per mole, the enthalpy might be considered as -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

In neutralization reactions, each mole of H+ from an acid contributes to the enthalpy change. So for HCl, each mole gives 1 H+; for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+. Similarly, each OH- comes from the base, and each contributes 1 unit.

So, the total enthalpy change would be the moles of H+ reacted (0.2) multiplied by the enthalpy per mole, which is -57 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, another approach. For strong acid and strong base, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), because each mole of H+ and OH- combines to form water, releasing that amount of energy.

So, if 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, then the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but wait, the units here are in kilojoules, not kilocalories. Oh, wait, the options have different units. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is another number.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure about the units. The options are a mix of kcal and kJ. So I need to be careful.

Wait, the question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization' and the options include both kcal and kJ. Hmm, that's confusing. Let's check the units again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often expressed in kJ. For example, 1 mole releases about 57 kJ. So if I'm calculating 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ released, so the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, so 11.4 kJ is close to option B, but option B is in kcal. So I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 1 kcal is about 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So if the question's answer is in kJ, then 11.4 kJ would match option B if the calculation was done in kcal. Wait, no, that can’t be. Let me see.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. What if the problem expects the answer in kilocalories? Because sometimes in nutrition, kcal is used, but in chemistry, it's usually kJ.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol. So 0.2 moles would be 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which translates to about -48.1 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ → 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.76 kJ). Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm not using the right approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the total volume and find the concentration of H+ and OH- after mixing, but I don't think that's necessary because stoichiometry is based on moles, not concentrations.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

So reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Enthalpy per mole: -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: -11.42 kcal → let's convert this to kJ to see.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal = 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.76 kJ. But that's higher than our calculated 11.46 kJ, which is about 11.5 kJ.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the neutralization of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 produces more than just water. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps the reaction would produce BaSO4 and water.

Let me write the reaction equation.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, the balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, let's balance it. H2SO4 has 2 H+ per molecule, Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 1 mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles of water.

So the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2. So when they are mixed, this reaction would occur if there's enough of each.

So let me calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. The reaction requires 1:1 ratio, so H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but after that reaction, what about the remaining HCl and any excess Ba(OH)2?

Wait, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

Now, the HCl is 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

So after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction, we have:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: all used in the reaction, so none left.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

So, the H+ and OH- from HCl and the excess Ba(OH)2 will react.

H+ (0.1 mol) + OH- (0.02 mol) → H2O (0.02 mol).

So that reaction produces 0.02 mol H2O, releasing 0.02 × 57.3 kJ = 1.146 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-calculate this.

Wait, first, the initial H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O. This reaction releases some enthalpy.

But how much? The enthalpy change for this reaction isn't the same as the neutralization of H+ and OH-. Because this is a precipitation reaction, which may have a different enthalpy change.

Hmm, this complicates things. Because when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, the reaction is more than just neutralization; it's a metathesis reaction. The enthalpy change for this reaction isn't the same as the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, but the problem statement is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization typically refers to the reaction of an acid with a base to form water. So perhaps the initial approach where I considered all H+ and OH- combining is the correct approach, but perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces both water and a salt, which might have a different enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the neutralization includes all H+ from acids and all OH- from bases, regardless of the specific acid and base.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from all sources, then find how much can react, and calculate the enthalpy based on that.

But the problem is that the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a specific neutralization which produces BaSO4 and water, and the enthalpy for that reaction is fixed. Similarly, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 produces BaCl2 and water, and that has a different enthalpy.

But the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed. Hmm, perhaps it's more straightforward to treat all H+ and OH- as contributors to neutralization, regardless of their source.

Wait, but I'm now getting confused because the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a separate reaction from neutralization. So perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy for each reaction separately.

So, let's outline the reactions:

1. H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O. Enthalpy change ΔH1.

2. HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O. Enthalpy change ΔH2.

3. HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → products.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by treating all H+ and OH- as reacting to form water, regardless of the specific acid or base. So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 moles react, releasing 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.42 × 4.184 ≈ -47.76 kJ. That's not matching. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H2O formed, and the calculation is based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat released from each reaction.

Let me think again. The problem has three solutions:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

So, in the mixture, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water, with the OH- being the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal). So 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 × 11.46 ≈ wait, no, 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal, so 11.46 * 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much bigger. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the total enthalpy released from each acid-base reaction, considering the specific neutralization of each acid with the base.

Wait, perhaps H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, which has two OH- per formula unit, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce two moles of water and one mole of BaSO4.

So the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 and 0.1 respectively. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So reaction: 1 mole H2SO4 + 1 mole Ba(OH)2 → 1 mole BaSO4 + 2 moles H2O.

This reaction releases a certain amount of heat, let's call it ΔH1.

After that, any remaining Ba(OH)2 would react with HCl.

HCl is 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 remaining after H2SO4 reaction is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so OH- is 0.02 moles.

Reaction: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So 0.02 moles OH- will react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl, producing 0.02 moles H2O. So HCl will have 0.1 -0.02 = 0.08 moles H+ remaining, but no OH- left to react.

Now, calculate the total enthalpy change.

ΔH1 is the enthalpy for the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction. The enthalpy for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 and water.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact enthalpy for that reaction. However, perhaps the problem expects us to use the standard neutralization value, treating each H+ and OH- as contributing to the neutralization.

So for the first reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-. So the reaction between 1 mole H2SO4 and 1 mole Ba(OH)2 would involve 2 H+ and 2 OH- reacting, producing 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change would be 2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4 reacted.

Wait, but that's for the H+ and OH- neutralization. The actual reaction also produces BaSO4, which has a lattice energy, so the overall enthalpy change would include that.

But I think the problem is intended to be solved by considering all H+ and OH- combining, so perhaps the initial approach is correct.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 ×57.3=11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is close to option B if it's in kcal, but that's 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.7 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.8 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per mole. Let me recheck.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in aqueous solution, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So one mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but what if the problem expects the calculation to be done per mole of H+ from each acid and base, but considering that H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole, while HCl contributes 1.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

The reaction uses up 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-, producing 0.2 H2O.

Each mole of H2O formed releases 57.3 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 2.7 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). So 11.46 × 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal. So the closest would be option B if the calculation were per H2SO4 and HCl, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy per mole of H2O as -57.3 kcal/mol. But that can't be right because 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 2.74 kcal. But option B is about 11.4 kcal, which is much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. M = 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. M = 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 *0.3 = 0.09 mol. H+ is 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. M = 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the calculations are correct.

Wait, but what if the problem expects the calculation to include the neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4, even if OH- is limiting?

Wait, no, because OH- is the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 H+ are used.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the correct enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, the only one close is option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes two moles of OH-, but perhaps the reaction is for each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to produce two moles of water, and the enthalpy is per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but if 0.09 moles of H2SO4 react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, each contributing 2 H+ and 2 OH-, then the total moles of H+ and OH- would be 0.18 and 0.18, but that's not matching the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each H+ and OH- reaction and sum their enthalpies.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the total H+ and OH- and then calculate the heat accordingly.

If the total H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, then 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer should be approximately -11.5 kJ. Looking at the options, none of them have -11.5 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -57 kcal/mol. Let's see. 57 kcal is approximately 238.3 kJ. So if it's 57 kcal/mol, 0.2 moles would give 11.4 kcal. That would match option B: -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but wait. 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ → 11.46 kJ = approximately 2.7 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much bigger. So perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 reacting, which would be 2 moles of H+.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the enthalpy based on the moles of H+ contributed by each acid.

Wait, the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.1, and from H2SO4 is 0.18. The OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-, so 0.1 H+ comes from HCl and 0.08 comes from H2SO4.

Wait, no. Wait, HCl provides 0.1 H+, H2SO4 provides 0.18 H+. The OH- is 0.2. So the OH- will take 0.2 H+, which comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

So 0.1 H+ comes from HCl (all of it), and 0.08 comes from H2SO4.

So the total H+ from HCl is 0.1, which fully reacts. The H2SO4 contributes 0.08 H+ reacting, and 0.18 -0.08=0.10 remains unreacted.

Wait, no, wait. The H+ comes from both acids. The OH- is 0.2, so it takes 0.2 H+ from the total 0.28 available. So the 0.2 H+ could come from either acid.

But perhaps the problem expects each acid's contribution to be considered separately. That is, HCl contributes 0.1 H+, which fully reacts with 0.1 OH-, releasing 0.1 ×57.3 kJ = 5.73 kJ.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 H+. The remaining OH- is 0.2 -0.1=0.1. So 0.1 H+ from H2SO4 reacts with 0.1 OH-, releasing another 5.73 kJ.

Wait, but then the total would be 5.73 +5.73=11.46 kJ, which is the same as before.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, the only option close is option D: -16.0 kJ, but it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kcal/mol. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kcal, which is approximately option B: -11.42 kcal.

Ah, that makes sense now. So perhaps the problem is using the value in kcal, not kJ.

So 0.2 moles ×57.3 kcal/mol =11.46 kcal, which is about -11.46 kcal. So option B is -11.42, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in fewer moles than H⁺.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), and the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.7 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - Since 0.2 moles of OH⁻ react, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A (-2.72 kcal): This matches the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Option B (-11.42 kcal): This is inconsistent with the calculation, as it is much larger than the expected value.  
   - Option C (-3.80 kcal): This is also inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - Option D (-16.0 kJ): This is inconsistent with the calculation, as it is much larger than \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change.
