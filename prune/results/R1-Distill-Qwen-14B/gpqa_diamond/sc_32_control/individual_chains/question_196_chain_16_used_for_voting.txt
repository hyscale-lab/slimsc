Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, things probably get a bit more complicated.

The question says it's a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a relativistic version, meaning I should probably consider how special relativity affects the motion.

Wait, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor. Oh right, the total energy would include relativistic effects.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max would be when the potential energy U is maximum, which is (1/2)kA². So the kinetic energy KE is ½ m v_max². Setting them equal: ½ k A² = ½ m v_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) → which is option C, but that's not relativistic.

But this problem is relativistic, so the classical formula won't hold. So I need to think about relativistic energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, no, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but maybe we can approach this classically. So the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (γ-1) m c², because relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but in the maximum speed case, the oscillator is at the equilibrium point, so all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the energy is conserved, so the total energy at maximum speed should equal the sum of potential energy at maximum amplitude plus kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The oscillator's total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A². But wait, in relativity, the energy isn't just the sum of KE and PE in that way because KE is relativistic.

Wait, not quite. Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or, when considering a harmonic oscillator, perhaps the energy is the sum of the potential energy (which is (1/2)k x²) and the kinetic energy which is relativistic.

But wait, maybe the energy is conserved as the sum of the classical potential energy (1/2)k x² and the relativistic kinetic energy (γ-1) mc². So at any point in the motion, E = (1/2)k x² + (γ-1) mc².

At the maximum amplitude x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc². But wait, velocity is zero, so γ is 1, because v=0 → γ=1. So the kinetic energy is zero. So E would be (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that's the same as the classical case. So when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential.

But when it's at x=0, the velocity is maximum. At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So E = (γ-1) mc². But E is the same as (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that can't be right because in classical mechanics, E = (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max². But in relativity, E is (γ-1) mc². So setting them equal:

(1/2)k A² = (γ-1) mc²

But γ is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). So substituting:

(1/2)k A² = (1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1) ) * m c²

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me rearrange:

Let me denote (1/2)k A² = (γ -1) m c²

So γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, (1/2) k A² is the potential energy, which is the total energy. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, which is (γ-1) m c².

So (γ-1) m c² = (1/2)k A²

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let me call it term X. So X = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + X)^2.

Inverting both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + X)^2

So:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + X)^2

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + X)^2 ]

So v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + X)^2 )

Wait, X is (k A²)/(2 m c² ). So substituting back:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute 1 + X = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So I can write the denominator as (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 → let me write that as [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

But maybe it's easier to rearrange the expression.

Looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches what I derived. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )) which seems to be positive. But I have a subtraction here. So probably not.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )) but again, the denominator inside the square is (1 - (kA²)/(2 mc² )) which is something else.

Wait, looking back, in my equation, X is (kA²)/(2 m c² ), and the expression for v is c times sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + X)^2 ). So that's D.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we consider the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy.

1. **Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude**:  
   At \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

2. **Total Energy at Maximum Speed**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

3. **Equating Energies**:  
   At maximum speed, the total energy is the same as at maximum amplitude:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Inverting and simplifying:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options, this matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
